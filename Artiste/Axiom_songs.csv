Axiom,A Little Ray Of Sunshine,"2 ContributorsA Little Ray Of Sunshine Lyrics[Verse 1: Glenn Shorrock]
Her father says, ""she has to have a name
Not the same as her mum's, but a name just the same""

[Chorus: Glenn Shorrock]
A little ray of sunshine has come into the world
A little ray of sunshine in the shape of a girl

[Verse 2: Glenn Shorrock]
We'll show her the dress that she'll wear
With the gold flowing hair that nature provided

[Chorus: Glenn Shorrock]
A little ray of sunshine has come into the world
A little ray of sunshine in the shape of a girl

[Post-Chorus: Brian Cadd]
A little ray of sunshine

[Verse 3: Glenn Shorrock and Brian Cadd]
I want to know if you think she looks good in the pink
Her grandma has bought her, our own little daughter

[Bridge: Glenn Shorrock and Brian Cadd]
She can make you feel good
She can make you feel that it's all worthwhile
Only by her smile
Only by her smile
You might also like[Verse 4: Glenn Shorrock]
Have you noticed she's just like her father
I think that I'd rather her hair was much darker

[Chorus: Glenn Shorrock and Brian Cadd]
A little ray of sunshine has come into the world
A little ray of sunshine in the shape of a girl

[Bridge: Glenn Shorrock and Brian Cadd]
She can make you feel good
And she can make you feel that it's all worthwhile
Only by her smile
Only by her smile

[Outro: Glenn Shorrock and Brian Cadd]
Only by her smile
Oh my little ray of sunshine
Only by her smile
Only by her smile
Only by her smile
Only by her smile
Only by her smileEmbed"
Axiom,Arkansas Grass,"1 ContributorArkansas Grass LyricsOoh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

If General MacAllister gave up the wars
And all of the people went back to their chores
Then all the King's horses and all the King’s men
Could go home

If all of the people were on the same side
There'd be no need to run, there'd be no need to hide
And all of us here in our grey tattered coats
Could go home

If you’d just listen Sir once again
To the reasons of one of your men
If you make all these things come to pass
Then I could lay on Arkansas grass

Home, home, goin' alone
To the sound of the military brass
Home, home, lovers alone
Layin' on Arkansas grass
Once again

Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
You might also likeSo gaily we marched with the grey and red
To lick'em first time like the good General said
With nary a thought that a so very few would go home

If it weren't so wrong for a soldier like me
To throw down his gun and to run to be free
Then all of us here with the fear in our eyes
Would go home

If you'd just listen Sir once again
To the reasons of one of your men
If you make all these things come to pass
I could lay on Arkansas grass

Home, home, goin' along
To the sound of the military brass
Home, home, lovers alone
Lay on Arkansas grass
Once again

Layin' on Arkansas grass
Layin’ on Arkansas grass
Layin’ on Arkansas grass
Layin' on Arkansas grass
Layin’ on Arkansas grass
Layin' on Arkansas grass
Layin' on Arkansas grass
Home, home, lovers alone
Layin' on Arkansas grassEmbed"
