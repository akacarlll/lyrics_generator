Ronny J, listen up

[Chorus]
I am the one, don't weigh a ton
Don't need a gun to get respect up on the street (Okay)
Under the sun, the bastard son
Will pop the Glock to feed himself and family (Sheesh)
By any means, your enemies, my enemies
We wet them up like a canteen (Damn)
The yellow tape surrounds the fate
Don't have a face, so now you late, open the gates (God damn)

[Verse 1]
Great, eliminate like ElimiDate (Ooh)
Hey, young boy had to penetrate (Ooh)
Face, young boy done caught a case (Ooh)
Bang, now his mama livin' with the pain (Uh)
Wait, doctor says he's gonna stay (Huh?)
Let him get the Senzu Bean so he regenerate (Oh)
Now a nigga harder than the head of the state (damn)
Denzel Curry is the new candidate (Damn)
Ultimate, alternate, you are the opposite
Stop this shit, chop your esophagus (Esophagus)
Bitches be boppin' it, bow down and pop it in
Droppin' it in her esophagus (Esophagus)
She get so nasty, in public she classy
Perhaps she is able to swallow it (Uh)
Girl, I can make you a star (Star, ooh)
Then I put her ass on Apollo, bitch (Damn)
Bitch, I am ultimate, behold my awesomeness
Narcissist, part time an arsonist (Flame)
Rippin' through cartilage, I am the hardest, bitch
Wrap it up, put in sarcophagus (Damn)
Dearly departed, it's done when it started
So now that I'm livin' so harmonious (Harmonious)
Feelin' like Spartacus, Curry the ultimate
I am the best, there's no politics
[Bridge]
Bitch, I'm ultimate
Ultimate
Bitch, I'm

[Chorus]
I am the one, don't weigh a ton
Don't need a gun to get respect up on the street (Okay)
Under the sun, the bastard son
Will pop the Glock to feed himself and family (Sheesh)
By any means, your enemies, my enemies
We wet them up like a canteen (Damn)
The yellow tape surrounds the fate
Don't have a face, so now you late, open the gates (Damn)
[Verse 2]
Ultimate, infinite, flow is opium
Open the internet, photosynthesis
Put in parentheses, temporary
Very scary if I feel like Dirty Harry
Just might bust a bitch, never knew my life
But yet the question is, ""Is he fake? Is he real?""
What the message is, chop a bitch nigga up
I'ma sever it when I sever shit
I kill 'em, no Kony, these niggas ain't homies
Claim you the homie, I turn into Broly
Droppin' melodic, enter the cosmic
Flow like a prophet, lyrical toxic
Flow like a foreigner, I'm the torturer
Out of South Florida, call the coroner
Killed in the corridor, I'm the overlord
Rhymes like a sorcerer, I'm an animorph
Bitch, I'm a beast
Nigga, you tell me who fuckin' with me
K to the I to the N to the G
Claim you the hottest, but I disagree
Better learn something and get a degree
This for Lord Infamous, so R.I.P.​
Arrivederci, bitches lookin' thirsty
Ridin' through the dirty, like it's mandatory
Ending of the story

I can't even trust my friends, most of them might be foes
Watch these hoes when they say they want a lot of me

This is the wrath of Aquarius
I am the black metal terrorist, ain't no comparison
Humanitarian, bitch, I'm a veteran
Better than anyone comprehend
Snake in the grass, cut the copperhead
Hollow tips point at a copper head
Drop a head, poppin' the Glock 'til the copper dead
But Bishop killed Radames
That is the biggest hypocrisy
I don't see nobody stopping me (Uh-huh)
Bro, your whole life is a mockery
A militant, mind on a million (Uh-huh)
Civilian, I am the realest, bitch
No Gilligan, put me on an island (Uh-huh)
Smoking on an island 'til a nigga look Thailand
Spread through your crew like a motherfucking virus (Uh-huh)
Cloud 9 confederate, breaking up barriers
Federation in your area (Uh-huh)
If I'm a bitch, then I guess you a pussy, and pussies are scared of a terrier, woof (Uh-huh)
Run all your paper, killer Curry keep on catching the caper
Dominating, (Uh-huh) common denominator
Aftermath, you can just do the math later, as a teenager (Uh-huh)
I was an underdog under the Raiders, valuable player
Young Bo Jackson slammin' packs with a passion
Satisfaction with the lack of compassion
It's a maverick hella gaspin', but actually
I am that nigga entirely
The same ones that inspire me be the same ones that wanna retire me, nigga

[Verse 2: Denzel Curry]
Mystical miracle, I build imperial
I'm analytical, why Lotto had to be off to the clinical
Now we're identical, black individual, no biochemical, serve
Fuck the cops, they the opposition
And these halfway niggas and these halfway hoes
Wanna be buddy-buddy, they see you at a show
But be the main ones that be hating on the low
Wait, that's just irrelevant
They got the fact when you look at my melanin, woah
Cops killin' niggas, niggas killin' brothas, niggas hate each other, don't know
Where the fuck they came from, we the ones that paid dues
I don't watch Fox News, don't mean that all my foxes sly
Find a little white girl, but let you die
Gun like a veteran, breakin' off barriers, they just might call me a terrorist
Rather get caught with it than without it, if I keep it concealed when I carry it, I
Put them on paper
Send them to prison and give them free labor
Separate everyone, make sure they neighbors
Aftermath, after that, we can laugh later
Fuck all my haters
I raise a Black fist as black as the Raiders
Home of the Gators
Federation is my organization
All relation, no religion, no races
Black to Asian, we the nation of U.L.T.
True to you, so keep it true to me
Haters cannot put an end to me because I truly know who is my enemy, nigga
[Chorus: Denzel Curry]
In the night time, keep me out of sight, it's the poltergeist
When I'm ghost, I'ma cut the line, now you outta mind

Inside this paper plane
Note my words are Navy sealed so here and I quote
Taboo and I are in the same boat
What's said from Pennywise, I guess we all float
Sky is the limit, I could die in a minute
Got my mind in a skillet, suicide not a mission
See the vibe very timid, I'm timid and very sad
Translated my thoughts and feelings, I pivot into the pad
Rapers turn to landscapers when they use hoes
Hoes turn to housewives when they see gold
Ice Cube with activator when I'm aggravated
Or decapitated when I lose my head since life is overrated
Two thousand feet, a thousand steps
I let it all sink to one thousand depths
Soon black balloons pop
Let it be the day the pain stop

Always show examples how they kill niggas like me
Thinking as straight as me, but call me crazy
Sun is my attitude, so I'm cool like JAY-Z

Cancel me like I ain't the King of D.C
Cancel me like I ain't the number one G
Cancel me like you don't like ""Dance On Me""
Quickly they forget how you change on all these lies
You flashing all these lights, and you savin' these kids lives
And they hate you 'cause you're right, give me hell then, shit

Baby, when you hear the siren sounds
When the karma come back 'round, don’t let me down
Baby, there's a time to stand your ground
Even if one of them sounds, don't let me down

[Verse 1: Denzel Curry]
Eyesight is a gateway to a new day and the same hate
With a new height and the same feet on a airplane yelling, “Mayday”
With a good girl gone bad girl who went gay ’cause of date rape
That's a metaphor for the US 'cause they got us all in the same state
State of mind, brain is minimized, put me on the news, only criticize
Revolution will never be televised for the enemy, they never empathize
And I never voted, never sugar coat it with my finger itchin' and my gun loaded
When the fire open, let it be your moment
When I shoot the sheriff if he not demoted, then bang! (Bang, bang, bang)
This for Trayvon and Tree, burn the bush and chronic, speakin' honestly
We livin' in colonies, CNN sit-comedies
Monstrosity run rampant all throughout United States
Talkin' about “let's make a fort,"" talkin’ about “let’s make it great”
If the shoes fit, tie it, grab the guns and riot
Time to run with lions on the road to Zion
In this age of violence, time to grab the iron
When I pop the silencer, it's nothing but silence when–

Got no protection but it's fuck the world
When she bend it over, being over-sensitive
But did I mention that my real intentions
Are on me really dealin' with the consequences
And I see your tone is very condescending
When I talk to you, but no you won't admit it
And I pity the fool
Been tryna vent, but you ain't tryna hear it
Like I'm not in here, but you gotta hear it
Just stop brushing me off to the side (Oh, shit)
Oh say, can you see a hundred dead bodies in the street
By the dawn's early light, double Sprite and a R.I.P. tee
So proudly, lights gleam, let the gun blaow in the night time
Of the slum house, little drum bump with the one thousand
Come-come, here they come

Gotta hate it, gotta love it, pass a class, I rise above it
Wise enough, advise the public, pistol bust, screamin' “fuck it”

Now we stuck in a rut, this ain't what I envisioned
What is what? What is guts when you don't have intuition?

(Ronny J, listen up)

[Verse 1]
I'm a gook
If I told you that I wasn't
Then a nigga wouldn't be tellin' you the truth
Back in high school, I admit I was a gook
But the way I rap had niggas fooled
Yeah, I'm a gook, niggas started skipping school, me and Monty and Raul
Hopping the fence by Carol City park
Fuck the next class, bitch, I'm already smart
Yet I'm a gook, see me growin' out my hair 'cause I look like the nigga from Roots
Yeah, I'm a gook, Denzel Curry been a gook
Nigga, that ain't nothin' new
Yeah, I'm a gook, probably thinkin' that I'm fool if I told you that I'm rappin' too
Yeah, I'm a gook, lookin' like that nigga Buu
Cut me off, I'm at the booth, bitch, uh

[Chorus]
Jabbie told me, we gon' blow like land mines
I don't fuck with purp, that's the only reason Yams died
Nigga, I'm a gook, hella ocky that's the truth
But I bet you I can even keep it ten times better than you
I'm a gook
Jabbie told me, we gon' blow up like a land mine
I don't fuck with purp, that's the only reason Yams died
Nigga, I'm a gook, hella ocky that's the truth
But I bet you I can even keep it ten times better than you
I'm a gook

Loose, with a screw, loose from the Tre Deuce, smoking boof
Bitch, I always knew, that I was a gook
But how this gook ended up surpassin' you
While you look at the views?
Made a hard album, so what can you do?
I'm the Gook Runner, the Imperial
Shout out to Mook, that be my flesh
Niggas can't fathom that I am the best
I gave you Threatz, Ultimate next
Shoutout the Klan because that's on the set
Fucking with me, I will put you to rest
Lie and you'll remember to speak with your chest
Gooking forever I'm still at your neck
Bitch, I'm gooking forever, so give me respect, bitch

[Chorus]
Jabbie told me, we gon' blow like land mines
I don't fuck with purp, that's the only reason Yams died
Nigga, I'm a gook, hella ocky that's the truth
But I bet you I can even keep it ten times better than you
I'm a gook
Jabbie told me, we gon' blow up like a land mine
I don't fuck with purp, that's the only reason Yams died
Nigga, I'm a gook, hella ocky that's the truth
But I bet you I can even keep it ten times better than you
I'm a gook
[Outro]
From the days, I've seen thus far
People tell me that I gook on the daily
One day, I'm gon' be a star
I don't give a fuck if you're gonna hate me
New chains and brand new cars
People tell me that it's all gonna change me
But for now, my mind's on Mars
'Cause you know a nigga gook on the daily52Embed"

Bitch, I'm Yung Plague with the AK steady sinning
Fuck life, and everything that fucking comes with it
Put the barrel in my mouth, blow my fucking brains out
I don't give a fuck about anything, now I'm finished
Never killed a motherfucker, but that's 'bout to fucking change
Throw my ass in jail, and just let me fucking decay
The world is fucking grey, I grip the fucking blade
And carve a line across my neck, and now I'm fucking saved

[Verse 2: CHARLES LEE RAY]
Bitch, I pull up in that motherfucking donk
Florida to N.O., we down to catch a homi'
Bipolar switching, twitching, now I'm Tony with the Tommy
Demonic logic, I might vomit from popping narcotics
Biologic product of a savage, my mama's psychotic
Here to abolish, killing trees with the touch of my finger
My shadows linger, the crypt keeper, it's $carecrow the reaper
Burning infernos, I'm eternal, these fuckboys just verbal
G-R-E-Y, hear the war cry of thousands that's burning

[Verse 3: Denzel Curry]
My T is black, hell is dark, and so is my heart
But it's switchin' like the nigga with the Yu-Gi-Oh! cards
Against all odds, eyes on another when you go against god
The ultimate is watching, so I guess I'm in charge
And if you think that you're hard, then I'ma act retarded
Why you ride bikes? Better off in a car bitch
I'm off it, stop, then I'm back in my starship
The ultimate martian in the hood when the hood is lookin' like hobgoblin
Steady mobbin', push it to the limit, I could talk about Ross, bitch
Know a couple niggas that can afford the apartments
Back from BLVCKLVND so I'm black and I'm heartless
Shots in the dark, I'm an excellent marksman
Chop a choppa down, come around with karma
That's why a nigga vibe when a nigga want drama
But I wish a nigga would like Cosmo and Wanda
No Timmy got a long black Jimmy
Smoking on that season milli and the plug is outta Philly
And I still tote the semi when I'm runnin' through the city
Like a motherfucking renegade
Reminiscing 'bout the violence of my old days
All black, bring it back to my old ways
Closed case, kill a nigga like a young Kane, my nigga

Feelin' like all my days are numbered, count until the end of me

Didn't notice, but as of late, I think I changed
Not the same since my younger days, so far I came
Feel my pain till I can't complain, cause I'ma slide for a minute
Till I rise in the business, make a billion, show my niggas what up
In this life, middle fingers up I don't fuck with a 95
I keep it true to me, why the fuck would I live a lie?
I'm living in this world, would you care if I live or die?
Are you down, then would you ride for me?
Because this life is so fucked up they telling lies to me
You are my main and as my main you'd better not lie to me
And I would tell you like Geminis there might be sides to me
She not my main bitch, I'ma tell you she's a side to me

[Verse 1]
Like, she assigned to me, but you are designed for me
And if I say I got your back then hold my spine for me
And if I couldn't shed a tear, girl, would you cry for me?
And if we was a couple doves, girl would you fly with me?
I'm overseas, what I oversee, ocean sea, see reflections of the way we supposed to be
Unluckily, we not at peace
That's the end of my clover leaf
Wouldn't care if you know it's me
Keep away until you notice me

[Verse]
Walkin' with my back to the sun, keep my head to the sky
Me against the world, it's me, myself and I, like De La
Got in touch with my soul
Treadin' softly on the path down the rockiest road
Life isn't ice cream without Monopoly dough
The property grows in value, and rightfully so, I gotta have it
I see the way the people get treated, it's problematic
They ready to set us up for failure, it's systematic
But when I felt it, my eyes melted
The selfish are constantly profitin' off thе helpless
I'll nevеr do my team green, make the team green like the Celtics
The ones that ain't makin' it overzealous, they show and tell us
Throughout history, earnin' cheddar
They form and break out nickel-plated chrome Berettas
The same ol' story in a whole different era
I'm watchin' massacres turn to runnin' mascara, but anywho
For the pain, see what this Henny do
So we can see what lies beneath as we pour up a swig of truth
The sun sets as I sip a few
The sky turns a different hue farther from the color blue
The nighttime has arrived, I recline for the evenin'
I'm hawkin' down the next goal, the name's ain't Stephen
I started in a nightmare so pinch me, I'm dreamin'
I'm killin' off my demons 'cause my soul's worth redeemin'

I, heard you were molested when you hit the age of five
So, in a sense I sensed that all your innocence had died
You, swallowing all of your pride, won't, let anybody inside
As you cry me a thousand lakes on my shoulder blade, I say
Everything's gonna be okay
I'ma hold tight 'til I see the next day with you
Stay with you, play with you, pray with you and pray to you

Black M,DEAD,"6 ContributorsBlack Muddy River Lyrics[Verse 1]
When the last rose of summer pricks my finger
And the hot sun chills me to the bone
When I can't hear the song for the singer
And I can't tell my pillow from a stone

[Chorus 1]
I will walk alone by the black muddy river
And sing me a song of my own
I will walk alone by the black muddy river
And sing me a song of my own

[Verse 2]
When the last bolt of sunshine hits the mountain
And the stars start to splatter in the sky
When the moon splits the southwest horizon
With the scream of an eagle on the fly

[Chorus 2]
I will walk alone by the black muddy river
And listen to the ripples as they moan
I will walk alone by the black muddy river
And sing me a song of my own

[Bridge]
Black muddy river
Roll on forever
I don't care how deep or wide
If you got another side
Roll muddy river, roll muddy river
Black muddy river roll

[Verse 3]
When it seems like the night will last forever
And there's nothing left to do but count the years
When the strings of my heart start to sever
And stones fall from my eyes instead of tears

[Outro]
I will walk alone by the black muddy river
And dream me a dream of my own
I will walk alone by the black muddy river
And sing me a song of my own
And sing me a song of my ownEmbed"
Black M,Tokyo Drifting,"1 ContributorDriving LyricsYeah, I’m mad now
Missing feelings when my head is in the clouds
Tokyo drifting, paint the asphalt all black
Up in smoke in my rear view, you in the back

Driving like crazy
On a highway, shawty melting in the back seat
We be going rapidly
She think we be flying, but we just doing hunnid klicks

Don’t you try to chase me
Underway to other world, another reality
Catch me I’ll be waiting
We be playing cat and mouse, lightning – and I flee

Oh you such a lame shithole
Got a new Longines, I don’t need no hoe
You be going crazy if you see me with this girl
Yeah, at least she’s loyal and she got a soul

Told ya that we meet in a year or so
May the second, it’s been long time ago
Conned me for a guy, for a lame fuckboy
Well, I grew out of it, I kept my hair on

Driving like crazy
On a highway, shawty melting in the back seat
We be going rapidly
She think we be flying, but we just doing hunnid klicks

What's up, my nigga?
It's time to empower these niggas, man, do it for the city
We gotta give it to 'em raw, though, you heard me?

[Verse 1: Denzel Curry]
Hair is nappy, knotty
Fuck karate, I got me a shotty
Jumpin' in the door, kamikaze
Origami if the neighbors saw me
But I won't fold, oh no
That's how the young boy's ass got smoked
Buddy got jacked like MK4
Sub-Zero, put a nigga on, so
Iced out
This the price I gotta pay because I wanna be iced out
Have them lookin' at my face as they tellin' me lights out
Sleep is the cousin of death, knowin' NY not my state of mind
211's broad day, I had to live a life of crime

[Pre-Chorus: Denzel Curry]
Get the product, then we out the door
Mama, I've been twistin' weed and now it's time to lock the fro
Blowin' dro
Call me knotty head 'cause I don't give a fuck
I was raised off in the project, know this life ain't meant for us
Bitch, I can't be touched
Get the product, then we out the door
Mama, I've been twistin' weed and now it's time to lock the fro
Let it go

Bumpin' Speaker Knockerz, ""Rico Story"" when I see the coppers, damn
Golds in my mouth and my dreads lookin' like a palm tree

Oyster, guarantee to get the pussy moister
If the earth don't wanna be saved, I disappoint her
As I constantly try to evolve just like a Togepi
Keep my pockets thick as The Parkers, Professor Oglevee
No one's sick as me, have the common cold, catch a cold from me
Isn't it ironic the younger me is the older me?
Fans demand that I rap about shit I did at seventeen
Might as well've cut my hair off and take some LSD

[Verse 2: IDK]
Disrespect Zel' and I might have to raise hell
The only way you live is if you saved by the bell
'Cause I’m teaching niggas lessons while they find a way to fail
That’s the reason why I think you niggas trippin' like you fell
Well, I flip a coin and make a wish
I wish these pussy niggas found a way to hop up off my dick
I flick my wrist and make her disappear, now that’s a fuckin' trick
I trick a nigga off the liquor to give me the money 'fore I fuckin' flip him
The diamonds on my neck wet, flippa
She wet but her last man wasn’t a good swimmer
Sim Simma, who got the keys to my Bimmer?
And then I check my pockets like, ""Oh, it's me, nigga"" (Skrrt)

Remember to remember
Matter fact, remember the fifth of November
Too many scars upon my face, no Simba
Rappers thinkin' they the most dark but I'm dimmer
Mos Def and grimmer
Dare to witness the superficial, mean and vicious
I'm mad as a infant without a parent havin' interest
Suspicious intent, ridin' around in five percent tint
Will push your cap back and send your soul to new dimensions
The ammunition only ignited my ignition
My ambition is only make right decisions on my mission
My division is separate from my business and my bitches
Every sentence and line is a reflection of time

[Verse 4: IDK]
My times table never was good at the time I was nine
At seventeen, I was forced in a nine-to-the-five
So nine times out of ten, I'm despising the eyes
Of the greedy ones all around me like some fucking flies
Get away, bye-bye, *NSYNC, lie, lie, instinct
Y'all niggas some fossils tellin' me how to live my life
Just suck my dick and bump my shit
And stream my shit so I can go and count my grip
Reverse the slavery every time I pull out my whip
Then pull up on a racist race like I am the shit
I limp towards the cake 'cause I am the pimp
Ain't nobody fuckin' my contracts up like Prince, uh29Embed"

If I bring a couple rounds with me
Then we all win
I came back and brought the crown with me
The king's den
Break your nexus and your neck 'cause
Everybody's on your head

[Verse 1: Gizzle]

Was too busy raising hell

I see my Future, but I'm not B-Rabbit
Balance my chi so I could tame the savage
Getting so throwed 'til my thoughts are in fragments (fragments)

[Chorus: Nyyjerya]
Movin' up like escalators
I can't see the floor, stackin' money, fuck a hater
Free bands cash flow
Bread so long, 'bout to buy the whole mall
Movin' up like escalators
I can’t see the floor, stackin' money, fuck a hater
Free bands cash flow
Bread so long, 'bout to buy the whole mall

Life is so golden that's how I'm livin'
Look at my trunk jumpin' out like it ribbit
Devil gon' hate, blurrin' my vision
That's me at my lowest, no Peter Griffin
Young, black and gifted, I'm 'bout to get lifted
Now all my troubles and problems have shifted
After my fifth hit it seems I'll be driftin'
I'm never slipping, I'm forever pimpin'

[Pre-Chorus: Denzel Curry]
You see my future, but you cannot have it
I see my Future, but I'm not B-Rabbit
Balance my chi now, I'm feeling fantastic
Getting so throwed 'til my thoughts are in fragments

[Chorus: Nyyjerya]
Movin' up like escalators
I can't see the floor, stackin' money, fuck a hater
Free bands cash flow
Bread so long, 'bout to buy the whole mall
Movin' up like escalators
I can’t see the floor, stackin' money, fuck a hater
Free bands cash flow
Bread so long, 'bout to buy the whole mall

[Verse 1: Denzel Curry]
I been peepin', searching for a pussy nigga photo, woo

I just need it, I’m anemic and I know it’s critical
And I’m sorry if I up the stick and have to click on you
I ain't going back to jail, nigga, fuck the feds
If I gotta kill a nigga, gotta cut the dreads
Put him in his spot, nigga, run the bread
Before I nut up put a gun to your head
Z3 or Z4, frankly I don’t know
Posted sellin' green so not no mo’, cause a nigga is tired of being broke
And I’m tired of living off my folks
My old girl need some help
And my girlfriend bout to have a jit
Plus I don’t want him growing up saying that he never had shit
That he never had it but based on analysis
I never seen challenges, I look at his Roley I know that he flashin' it
I wouldn't mind seeing blood just like I got off dialysis Lord of the dark and violent
Only know imperial niggas move in silence, look that old boy yeah you shining
Steve got gold, and his girl got diamonds
Hopping in the whip, 2 niggas riding
We all gon die nigga fuck reclining, we all got 5 lets get behind em
Let's go get em

Who’s that peeking in my window?
Baby, please pass the extendo
Hey yo, they tryna take my cheese and my steelo
Two 44s at your head, don’t be a hero
I said who’s that peeking in my window?
Baby, please pass the extendo
Hey yo, they tryna take my cheese and my steelo
Two 44s at your head, don’t be a hero

[Verse 2: Denzel Curry]
I been seeing, watching cause these niggas got it in for me
Flexing flashy wrists is correlating with my golden teeth
Diamonds all around a neck and it came with a diamond ring
I done seen all kind of shit, what niggas do over finer things
That’s why I carry the nine on me that’s a three times three extendo, that’s a 10-4
Seen them niggas on the 191, but a nigga peep game on the 194
Woah, bending corners just to see if they followed us
Sweating bullets, heater under my cardigan
These type of niggas is known to be poppin' shit
Deep in my thoughts, know who the prophet is
Tryna to take my wealth gotta protect my wifey and my jit
Gotta set an example if you thinkin' I'm a walking lick
Never believed in lawlessness, but I could be with the shits
When I’m nervous it's dangerous, if the police pull up then I tell em I’m innocent
They tried to run down on us, pulled out the clip then I empty it
Lords of the dark and violent, just ended up on the pavement, quiet
This is the reason why niggas divided, pray to the lord I don’t get indicted
Send me all the way to Rikers Island, dead on the ground now he’s a carcass
That’s our guy, nigga, that’s our target
Let’s go get em
[Chorus: Denzel Curry & Police Chatter]
Who’s that peeking in my window? (Calling backup, calling backup)
Baby, please pass the extendo (Calling back up right now)
Hey yo, they tryna take my cheese and my steelo (We have a young nigga on the ground right now)
Two 44s at your head, don’t be a hero (Uh, dreadlocks, black tee)
I said who’s that peeking in my window? (Call the paramedics right now)
Baby, please pass the extendo (Suspect is in a white Porsche)
Hey yo, they tryna take my cheese and my steelo (2 other suspects in the vehicle)
Two 44s at your head, don’t be a hero (Please follow them, we got a problem now)

[Outro: Denzel Curry]
Ayo, when I see that nigga again, fool

Black M,Please Forgive,"78 ContributorsPlease Forgive Lyrics[Intro: Denzel Curry]
A nigga really done fucked up now
Lemme catch my breath, finna hold my breath
Yo Power, this a really great beat, good job

[Verse 1: Denzel Curry & IDK]
Get it and go, stack up my dough
Bitch eat my dick like a meatball hero
Black on my body like Neo
I been had the sauce, I'm the new Tapatío
The fuck is a T.O.? Terrell Owens
Fuckin' bitches barely knowin' them
Sometimes I feel suicidal
Shout out to my nigga $crim
Bang, no Chiddy, run it up like Giddy
Better not fuck with me, Zeltron 6 Billi'
Got the rock like Milly, get cent like 50 (Yeah)
Better not talk shit when I got goons with me
I got the power (Right), but I'm not a Ranger (Yeah)
Got the beat by Powers (Right) and we just made a banger

[Verse 2: IDK]
Get it and go, I'll stomp your ass to the ground
If you think you can fuck with my flow
Open the door, I do not walk through that muh'fucker
If they not talkin' no dough
I don't smoke dro, I barely drink
Pour up that coffee for niggas that sleep
Used to sell quarter of ounces of stink
I make a quarter a show if you blink
You couldn't see what I saw, now you peep
Now they on D, I hit the flea-flicker
You should've seen quicker, I'ma just Ether him
I'ma just Ether him, make 'em see heater, son
I'm a say I'm the dad, niggas from Trinidad
Come with that choppa that don't need no helipad
Hit your ass, pop-pop, and now you irrelevant
Pop up the trunk and I don't mean an elephant
I'm talkin' stacks, you talkin' bricks
All of the rhymes you rap ain't legit
I catch a case, I plead the fifth
You catch a case, you bring the clique
I'm not the type to lose sleep for a bitch
I might just fuck for a week then I quit
I might just cop me a Rollie that don't lose the value
And trade in the shit for a crib

He shoot his shot and I bet he gon' score
Hit it and go, I pass her to bro

[Verse 3: ZillaKami]
Bitch, I don't got no respect for opposition (Okay)
Casket and it don't show with dirty feelings (Okay)
Blood on my blunt, you get the picture (What's up?)
Blaze carry blades with tetanus, don't get shot (Huh?)
Y'all think your Majin gettin' booed off stage (Yeah)
Write books like me, you ain't on my page (Yeah)
Drac' fightin' our apes, it's our ways (Yeah)
Bet you won't act tough with a gun in yo' face (Okay)
I'll pull up with a red light, nigga, what's up?
Nigga try to peel off like, ""Oh shit, fuck"" (Huh?)
When the buckshot spray, better duck or have luck
All my dogs got fed when the moon comes up (Haha)
Wit' a pit bull off its leash
It's the Wardog boss (Okay)
Real circle, never break they form (Okay)
Stay militant (Okay) when the clip go off (Okay), what's up?

[Verse 4: Zombie Juice]
I just jumped back like I'm on one
Look what you did, bitch, you owe us somethin'
I'm just the guy, like just get it done
Smokin' gelato, got plenty sons
You like Juwanna Mann, I like designer fame
Tats on my chest, rep' the Zombies, man
All on that bitch like a sonogram
I be that nigga, that Hall of Fame
Look at yourself, we are not the same
High as a pit like I'm on a plane
Fuckin' that bitch like they all the same
Ain't nothin' with Juice
I'm drunk off the booze with a thou' on the shoes
I just won't lose, niggas is fool, swag
Rockin' the blue fur, I like that bitch right there
Think I'm gon' like, her

Black M,N64,"41 ContributorsN64 Lyrics[Chorus]
Moshin' to nostalgic rock shit, I'm Brock, bitch
Semi-automatic might blast like Team Rocket
Wait, and tell 'em I'm mixing that Slayer with that 2Pac shit
One golden bullet to kill all that faggot pop shit

[Verse 1]
Delivery, I'm the bullet that killed Kennedy
Enemy, D.I.T.C., darkest symphony
Necro, fuck around and let the TEC blow
Red beam to his noggin make it look like techno
I told you, I don't even wanna be the best, ho
I'm the threat with Tourette's making motherfuckers John Doe
Ricky Rozay, Aquarius Killa The Keyser Soze
Making a family cry together like the O'Jays
Back in the old days, I'm the one that's chosen
Thug from the 90's, I'm cryogenically frozen
Avenger, but yet I be the Joker and the Riddler
With a mindset that's switched like Harvey Denture's dent
The Dark Knight, fuck a Clark Kent
Martin Lawrence when he traveled back in time with suspense
Suspended, animation when my brain reacts
Don't belong in this world like I'm Samurai Jack
Click Clack on the Glock, seventeen get me
Then put the Ghostface so we can empty the cream
Cash rules everything around me surrounding

""Yeah, Mike, things are quite here now at Miami, Carol City High School, but earlier today was quite the scene when nearly the entire student body walked out of the school to protest Trayvon Martin's murderer. Signs in hand, chanting, ""Justice for Trayvon."" Now Trayvon actually went to school here at Carol City last year so some of these kids actually knew him personally, and they say his murderer should be behind bars

Cheated with the virus that took over the life of Magic
Sharing a needle, with the common-slash-hobo
Sterilize with the spit that shoots from a Komodo
Dragon, gun chuck, fire, I'm blasting
Dope and sick , that shit is just a classic
Huh, that's a hit for you bastards
That's the shit for you bastards
I'm lugubrious because I'm from a place where niggas
Shoot at shit and never on no Buddha shit, that knock-knock
And who is it? Am I really losing it? Maybe
Trapped in a white room with a dead baby
Am I going crazy? Is my name Casey?
Anthony, then the baby turns into an amputee
God damn I'm really losing my mind
Or should I end it all just by grabbing a nine?
But, it's too easy, Demonz of my mind leave me leave me
Put me into isolation so you wouldn't see me
Free me from misery and un-easy
Pain, emotions from the crypt I gain
Yet another young brain slain, mane...Dang!

You see us as winners, when do we ever win?
When am I even good enough? Acknowledge your friends
Sometimes things get broken and we argue again
Spent the last 20 minutes all inside of my head
I'll explain it as takin' cash on culture from the poachers
Scopin' everything I have, ignorin' all the bullshit that made me mad
Killin' coral reefs, smoking weed too fast
Almost got skipped, bitch I read too fast, I don't bleach my past
These are the titles G's supposed to have, cold in the summer
Sweatin' bullets out on Flatbush Ave
Spirit like I got a platinum plaque, modern acrobat, the mass effect
I sharp shoot 'em, make them tap the mat, so accurate
We represent the illest seniors, small demeaners
Tellin' lies inside this room of cheaters
Even at the stage of a fetus, I reclaim to repeat this to all my demons
That's pigeon-holin' your genius and feedin' right into weakness
How can he write his thesis? He don't believe in Jesus
Sweetness, I'm almost speechless, for our future, egregious
We gotta pick up the pieces shawty, I'm familiar with pain
Used to play by myself when they considered it lame
Do this thing by yourself, nothing is ever obtained
Introverted but I’m emergin' the spark to the flames
I won't harp on a thing
I won't causin' the blame, but it's hard to obtain

A real friend'll kill you if you asked him to
Instead of stabbing on the back of you
Just trying to get ahead
But you can't spend a dime if you work yourself dead
We are so deep in love with the sinner but not the sin
How could she turn my king size into a waterbed? Damn, I'm just sayin'
Kick her out the crib and scream, ""Baby, come back""
Then kick her out again—I'm just crazy like that
Bitches fall in love with a nigga out of his mind
And I fall so deep into lust with a chick with a big behind
My ex left cause I ain't got no hits
I heard her new boyfriend lumpin' her up with his fists
But hey, you got what you asked for, I'm petty as shit
That's some food for thought, I let you do the dishes

But I had a misses though, believe me, shoulda vacay'd in Tahiti
Wishing you were dyin' with me, sweet as hugs and diabetes
Leave me, love me, touch me, cut me, lustin'
Fuck me, busty, dusty, old and rusted
Baby, do you mind if I revise what's in your mind?
You see my call declined because a certain point in time
I'm hopin' every line it hits like millimeter nine
You beggin' me to change, that is a penny to a dime

Optimistic like Optimus, we ain't even reached our prime

Rest in peace Uncle Rob, we miss you, bless your heart

Gonna need nine lives if you get outta pocket
If I see cousin James, I'll knock his eye out his socket

Black M,Melt Session #1,"92 ContributorsTranslationsEspañolSvenskaMelt Session #1 Lyrics[Intro]
Yo

[Verse]
Take a ride on my train of thought, fundamentals what I bought
Penniless, I await the emptiness enlightened
Twenty-six years on Earth, my soul fighting
Habits that ain't happen, my body has took a liken
To my lifestyle, battling stress the size of Goliath
Slingshots plus hard rocks, these stones getting thrown
My temptations are amplified when I get alone
Tried to separate the action from the man
I wholeheartedly understand why I need to grow even though I'm grown
If I did you wrong, I vow to make it right
Judgе me off appearance, it was said to mе, I'm impolite
Eyes remain in freeze mode, I'm stuck in fight-or-flight
I'm deflecting my daily problems within my daily life
Recognize hidden patterns of my own demise
Why I feel like hiding a truth is finding a lie?
Dealt with thoughts of suicide, women I've objectified
Couldn't see it through my eyes so for that, I apologize
I'm just hypnotized, working hard to empathize
Strung out on love addiction and groupies when souls collide
I've been this way since the day I turned six
I've been touched before, way before I touched my—
Now I'm almighty pushing through the pain
The almighty cushion to the flame
The birds and burning bushes in my brain
I had to make an effort, double overtime to change
Had to journal my journey and mistakes I made on the way
Manipulation to get what I want
Getting very distant after I got what I need
Writing rap and wisdom, whiskey, women, wars and weed
Narrating all these conflicts, then top it off with greed
I keep walkin', I keep walkin', I keep walkin'
Me and my so-called best friends don't speak often
Blaming me for everything when they can't point fingers at they selves, so be grateful I offered the help
Being aware is my definition of melt
My eyes see imperfections within myself
Cracked images, bad luck, and broken mirrors
Funny how I see in permanent so clearer
I dedicate this to the ones I hurt
It's time to get my spirit right on earth
Before my sins become a evil curse
Conquer thirst, can't revert to who I was at first
I channel God through this verse
Accountability, I take responsibility
For all my actions, I packed them in these soliloquies
Just because we're not friends don't mean we're enemies
Thank you all for listening, sending y'all with good energy

And you got no money, so you can't feed the jit

Goddamn, the more they hate us, that just motivate us
I know revenge tastes the sweetest, mmm, I'm gon' savor
I'm just sending all my graces up to my creator
No negotiation, this is world domination
You can fill the trophy cases up with nominations
I'm the Alpha-Omega, that mean you can't replace us
That mean I'm throwing dice in Vegas, betting all the wages
My girl expensive, remember you get what you pay for
Big, big pay-off moves on and off the radar
You can't afford to miss a layup when you in the playoffs (Uh)
Press on, stress on
I give this shit blood, flesh, bone
Can't catch me, I skate to my destiny
That's necessity, you can't out-finesse me

Touch me, tease me, please me, just don't test me

Told my shrink that life is crazy, he said, ""Life is crazy""
I bought a house so fucking big it feel like I'm my neighbors
I told my weed man, ""I need nature,"" he accommodate me
I got two choppers look alike, I call 'em crock and gator
The flowers looking quite amazing, I ain't like the fragrance
I stand beside a baby, see who you decide to play with
I'ma take my fucking chances, I'm a lucky bastard
My heart race 'til it catch up to who it's running after
Oh my gosh, I'm gone, I'm on a planet I'm not knowin'
Said, ""Let there be light,"" but then all my lights were blown
Yeah, I know my rights, I mean I know right from wrong
I know yayo white and sweeter than a yellow bone

Klan shit, nigga
You ain't never heard no tales from the darkside
You ain't never heard no tales from the darkside
Welcome to the land
You ain't never heard no tales from the darkside
What it's 'bout?!

[Verse 1: Denzel Curry]
It’s ‘bout a young nigga, running away from the moon to catch the sun quicker
Drug dealer, Nino with the steelo trying to sell kilos and grams
Settling angry stomachs up in his fam
So if that silver spoon on your plate, if you touch that, that's your fate
Don't have faith, Like Evans, you got to face demons to get to your heaven
The pimps is the prophets, not prophets for reverends, this is the lifestyle of a broke adolescent
So here's a lesson of a teen that survived Rikers
But shortly, his life had ended with a bullet that's made out of Midas
Touch

[Chorus: J.K. The Reaper]
You ain't never heard no tales from the darkside
You ain't never felt the pain of the darkside
You ain't felt the burning flames of the darkside
You don't have a fucking name on the darkside
You ain't never heard no tales from the darkside
You ain't never felt the pain of the darkside
You ain't felt the burning flames of the darkside
You don't have a fucking name on the darkside

Knew a young brother without a name, he was in love with his nina trapped
And steadily schemin', barely sleepin', but dreamin' of pretty bitches and beamers
But when he awake, he sees his fate
And his reality, to do whatever it takes to elevate his fucking salary
Any nigga's a casualty, kill 'em, rob 'em
Then casually walk off into the darkness, it all started
When he was, welcomed into our fucked up world, the son of a fucked up girl
And his father was just a blur, his life had took a curve
When he saw his brother dead on the curb, due to retaliation
Of the gang relation,  he was young, a kid, a baby
And yet to realize the pollution of the nation
Now he 18 life in jail is what he facin'
Shit, murder was the case that they gave him
Shit, murder was the case when they raised him
Mind stuck in the all black prison
You think he give a fuck about the system?

As he cased out the bank,  he was catching that shank
Getting loaded the stick,  trying to major his rank

Rush the security, no longer pure was thee
Soul turned it cold for the love of the gold
Bust in the air, everyone hit the floor
Not giving a fuck, loc-ing off of the 'dro
Bodied a nigga, riding in a dropped ‘Lac
Top back, cruising them twenty fours
So I went crazy, my vision got hazy
I walked in the bank, and I start to get bold
Clutching that pistol grip
The teller was moving too slow so I pistol-whipped
The bitch, he was twitching, bust at a civilian
And blasted the mag with no mask in the buildin’

Burn the fingertips off, replace the dental
Left the golden bullet magic in his coufie, no his temple
That’s engraved, leaving corpses
In graves, Glock 17 cutting fades

Then we switched the identity, chose the name Leroy Carter
The bank teller looking short and squeamish
Steve pistol-whipped the bitch; she kept screaming
Shut up, ho, before a nigga nut up, ho
Steve said he couldn’t take the shit
So he took her to the back, then Steve grabbed the MAC
Then he put it to her head, and then he ripped the bitch

Hard to victimize when evil's idolized
Inside my battered mind, I have visions of bein' broke

Shattered and lost, chatterin' talk, blabberin' off
Grabbin' the cross, telling Jesús nothing matters at all, ugh

The black balloon pops, the black balloon dies
I must be the black balloon and
The children of the world always meets a doomed end
The earth will soon end

Fear of loss, fear of change, fear of losing my peers
Apparently I will watch the whole world collapse and appear
No tears, my intuition tells me that the end is near
The only thing I should fear is fear itself
Learn that being afraid of God is being afraid of yourself
So go to church nigga, but I won't go cause I don't know
Where all the money and the collection plate go
If the church still owe, then you know, read your bible at home
I'ma read it myself, all the stories that I'm reading show me how to prevail
The guard came in the other day and gave me some mail and said that I got a phone call
When I get out we gon' go harder than Medusa, building stone walls out of human flesh

Story with no title, everything is vital
Came up in this game now my idols is my rivals
Childhood friends end up pulling guns on you
Hoes wanna fuck because you carry funds on you
Like a blind man in church homie I don't see none of that
Still can't believe that I made it off rapping
Baby bottle blue mic spitting blue magic
How the fuck the rap game become a beauty pageant?
Fugazi ass rapper trying to sound like Atlanta
Cause they got no identity, I'm off the top like
O-Ren Ishii vs. Uma Thurman
Gasoline, in my thermos and I'm 'bout to make a furnace out you niggas
Spitting ether, make-believers call it Easter
I am Jesus with a blacker penis, that is fucking genius
Who said Jesus can't be a black guy?
Even Luke Skywalker's father was on the dark side

[Chorus]
Story with no title, everything is vital
Praying for my rivals let the church say (ay!)

South Florida 21 getting older mind of a marine ever since I was a teen
Blowing up smithereens, living a broke man's dream
Follow the roots of the prince 'til they crown me king

This ain't the place that I choose to be
Where friends become strangers
Everybody wants to be a gangsta

Little badass jits that's where the story begins
'Fore the end of the timeline, on to the crimes rise
Out here beefing ain't no working at Five Guys
It's wild, convicted felon put on trial
It's sad, a mother outlives her child
And that's bad, especially because we're black
When the revolution start that's when the niggas attack
I'm looking at the liars that say you ain't come from riches

It's like my world is reversing
Even the pain couldn't hurt me now
Rewind the good to the worst things
Even my love has deserted me now
I cannot love 'cause it hurts me
I will be happy when I see the sun drown
I have transformed to the worst me
Infinite words couldn't curse me now

[Verse 1]
Everything is backwards mother's saying that I'm sinning
Close my eyes and say, ""Forgive me""
'Cause I know the devil ain't
Devil told my mother in the end that he'll be winning
'Cause the world is full of sinning
No, your son is not a saint
Spirit of God and the holy ghost, it was written in anecdotes
That a snake would try to corrupt what he create
Sick of facades and the horoscope, I devour the antidote
Told my mother that I was spirited away
Monstrosity murdering masterpieces, I'm mutilated
Falling forever, fear and forsaken, incinerated
Innocence inferno when I'm no longer incubated
Welcome to the world whenever I'm reincarnated
Relyin' on the last breath, but y'all would never know
Rewind it to the last step, play me when I'm below
If heaven's set on fire, that's the day they make hell snow
The devil want my soul and yet I'm tellin' him, ""Hell no""

Everything is backwards ever since the new beginning
God has given me the vision so that I can see my fate
Blind can't lead the blind and if we try, then we'll be spinnin'
In a cycle in position, try to find a better place
Lucifer, devil, the anti-christ taking light up out of my life
In the darkness, it seems to me there's no escape
Initially alter it into dark, place the pain inside of a pot
And then bury it in a spot where I decay
It's death before dishonor, I'm a hideous disfigurement
Who dying from the envious evil trapped in Floridians
Came from the Vatican, kill off the advocate
Feeling inadequate, when a bitch nigga bleed
Won't even make it to see 23 years, fuck it, I don't wanna be
Here, look at the time when I'm turnin' it back
On the clock and  my right hand makin' it tick
Life is a bitch, better yet, it's a pit
And my hatred is everyday making you sick
Regurgitated, early stages, earn the hatred
Burn the sages, caught in mazes
Instigated, inspiration, imitations
Only here, reanimated, damn

It's like my world is reversing (Reversing)

Yo, I can see it in your eyes, think you just got two
Fascinated with the new flu, two by two
All my zoo shit true and I'm too badu
I be all over their head like the shampoo do
Snoozing on a revolution so I blew by you
Literally leave your body in the Blue Bayou
We be looking at your troopers and your crew like ''who?''
Educating, elevating on your boo IQ
Pledge allegiance to nothing, I got the wood and he crushing
My kamikazes are coming to light Picasso percussion, you dummy
Little bummy ain't a damn thing funny
You so poor, honey, all you have is money

[Hook: Nitty Scott]
So inhale the fragrance
I be the apex, ho, get on my wavelength
Another like me? Highly unlikely
Hiding in my psyche, I dare you to come and find me

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
I dare you to come and dare me to flip and commit a homi
I promise to God I'm probably the God of rhyming
Dividing the profits with prophets, prophecy wasn't lying
I grew my hair out just so I could look like a lion
So when I say I wore it, that metaphor is more exciting
I understand that, for sure like beach homes and sand crabs
Bonjour, bitch pardon my French
I never been to France, but I like to kiss like them
Consider this the Kiss of Death like Jada came through
Nitty, you know it's love when they showing hate, boo
Food for thought, hope you get a plateful
Lately I done turned the booth to a dinner table
Young mindfuck, what the fuck you thought?
Fire in my eyes, in my shades it's dark
And I'm still getting used to this famous part
They say I sold my soul, but what about what I bought?

More dread from warheads
They want the poor dead, but I fed the universe on my forehead
And did this happen beforehand?
Now face it, they just basically erasing them glitches up in the matrix
Always thought the term Black Magic was kinda racist
And I have yet to find intelligent basis for all the hatred
Attracting and deflecting a core of my star portals
Ain't it gorgeous to be mortal? I couldn't be more cordial
Now who dare stare into the hazy sun?

A rap star wit the boomin style, black as tar
Smokin, the E's no jokin, so don't trip or flip
And make a hit, so bust it
Some ain't feel the way I do when I get wreck
No half steppin, I kick back like a weapon
On the microphone, I delight
And groovy, a California quake couldn't move me

Detailed Events:

No Limits Championship Tournament Quarter-Final Match
M1: Eddie Edwards w/ Will Olaffub, Steve Blackman & Croyle def. Robbie Williams via submission

*Robbie Williams slow to get up gets medical treatment and has his arm in a sling  and as he is getting carted to the back. Steve Blackman grabs Robbie and destroys him in quick fashion, soon Croyle and Edwards even get some cheap shots in and Edwards re-applies his finishing submission hold Crossface as paramedics pull him off

*Troy Clausen with Joel Gertner comes out during the mugging of Robbie and he screams at The Truth Infantry “What are you doing?, Olaffub orders Edwards to stop as The Truth Infantry slowly walk past Clausen with their arms up as if to say they aren’t guilty of attacking a defenseless hurt wrestler. Robbie doesn’t look good.

Troy: (up to Ollafub and Infantry on top of ramp) If you guys all wanna get physical tonight, Well then you got it! 6 man tag match, Truth Infantry versus Ruckus, Pac & Rey Mysterio later tonight.

Olaffub: (answering confidently as the infantry smiles deviantly) Not a problem, as a matter of fact Troy why a 6 man tag, How about 2 on say…..5
Troy: Alright, if you jagaloons got a death wish then fine. 5 is what you want, 5 is what you are gonna get, Ruckus, Pac & Mysterio. Now you got all of them plus, 2. The 2 being men who happen to be the greatest tag team in this industry, Taka Naka on top of that! Good luck

Blackman grabs mic from Olaffub:
Troy, you are gonna look stupid at the end of the night. I guarantee it.

M2: Golden Bryce def. Vinny Testaverde

Bryce wins in dominant fashion

Human Resources Help!!!!!
*Mick Foley comes out to the ring then brings out Jake Awesome and says he has to be motivated and that one loss and one occurence of him tapping out doesn't mean the world is over

*Jake Awesome responds almost confused as to why Mick has brought him here and gurantees yes indeed, he tapped out at heatwave but if given the chance to take on Slayer again. He wouldn't do it again. Jake thanks Mick for his help and Mick Foley responds claiming
""I AM THE #1 JAKE AWESOME FAN!""

*Slayer with Marc Snow comes out at the end. Fine Speech Mick, Jake Awesome to these people will always be the hero. Jake Awesome will always be the champion. Regardless, of who is holding it. and here we are show #2 of the “spark is back” but where exactly is the title.
He was the last champion, I made him tap even with a biased officiator. I deserve gold.
Mick: Slayer, Mr. Clausen has informed me not to spill this news but I thank the fans RIGHT HERE in Irvine, California (cheap pop) need to know this information. The new XPWEW world heavyweight champion will be crowned at Anarchy Rulz. Next week, more details will be revealed
Marc Snow: interrupts, Mick! more details revealed my son should have the belt! Where is it! Where is the belt! My son should have it.
Mick: Marc I don’t think we’ve formally met, I do know about the urban legend. The urban legend that this crowd is chanting. Your independent persona of Nick Foley, in the 90’s where you sold counterfeit 8 x 10’s claiming you were me. I don’t hold any grudges against you I get it. You gotta put ice cream in the freezer. I know the stories. but Marc, one thing I won’t tolerate from you is the sass leaking from your quivering lip.
Marc: Mick
Mick: No, No for 20 years I tolerated you profiting from MY NAME, MY LEGACY, watching you maintain a living pretending to be me! A cheap version of mick foley, So how dare you call me biased. Maybe I’m taking this a little too far na maybe I’m letting my 20 years of aggression against you leak out in this trivial argument: No, don’t bow up at me it’s trivial. You still won the match. You still beat the mammoth. but how dare Marc Snow call me biased. A man who held a bias against his youngest son, a bias for your entire life (pointing at Slayer). I do’t know how you can just apologize with this snake. Marc I don’t even wanna see your face. You can call me bias, but you can’t call me an abusive father. You can’t call me a bias parent and you damn sure can’t teach me a damn thing about being without morals. I broke my body in half on every continent to provide for my family, not take all the loot and leave them for dead and then come back to my sons life twenty years later asking for a handout. I’ve lost respect for you Slayer, so yeah I had a bias against a guy that can make amends with this liar.
Marc: Mick, I’m in a decent mood tonight and I’m trying so desperately not to punch you in your fat bearded face but what the hell
*Jake Awesome slaps Marc Snow down to the ground and then attacks Slayer repetitively.
(Slayer and Marc Snow powder out of the ring.)
*Mick: Marc, I know you’ve spilt blood. but I know you haven’t spilled as much as me but tonight. I’m gonna put the Zebra stripes back on (pulls off Red flannel to unveil Zebra flannel)
Heatwave rematch tonight! Slayer vs Jake Awesome

Mick: And Marc Snow, to assure you and your baby boy aren’t a victim of bad officiating. You can wear the stripes too. Jake Awesome will NOT lose again.

Slayer: I don’t wanna wait let’s do this right now

*Guest Referees: Mick Foley & Marc Snow
M3: Slayer def. Jake Awesome

so much interaction between Snow and Foley, Slayer mouths a lot to Foley throughout

Slayer def. Jake via submission yet again. Awesome taps and Foley doesn’t know how to react as he hesitates yet still raises Slayer’s hand in victory

Mick: Jake, even Michael Jordan missed a few shots, even Tom Brady lost a super bowl, Jake Awesome, I still think you are the best professional wrestler this industry has ever seen. Jake barely acknowledges Mick and just walks to the curtain looking at the ground.

M4: The McGraws def. Mondo Milk ENT
*The McGraws run down the crowd praising Alex Jones to be their manager. The McGraws now dub themselves. 1776. Massive heat basically white heat from their post match promo about Obama being born in Kenya


M5: Tanahashi def. Kota Ibushi with a knee to Kota mid-air going for his shooting star press. Tanahshi sneaks the win.

*Interview: Kandi Khaos speaks with Jaques Dudley tonight on his match with Chris Johnson and Champagne Clausen and where does he stand with Troy Clausen.
*Jaques says Clausen claims he’s changed, I’ll guess we’ll see

M6: Jaques def. Chris Johnson & Champagne Clausen in a three way dance
Jaques pins Johnson
Troy Clausen and Joel Gertner come out clapping his hands. Jaques that was an impressive victory. What everyone here didn’t realize is what you guys just watched was a number #1 contenders match for the heavyweight title. Congrats Jaques *Clausen winks*
Jaques nods unaware if he should believe Troy or not

*Backstage: Clausen walking back behind the curtain to a sweaty Slayer and Marc Snow in his hippie tye die referee shirt. What the fuck was that Clausen?
Troy: What?
Slayer: So Jaques beat your rookie son and that human scum Chris Johnson and he’s in the damn title chase
Troy: Yeah, do you watch the show, thats what I just said. and I’m the boss and well your not.
*Marc Snow grabs Gertner’s neck brace tightly choking him
*Slayer gets up in Troy Clausen’s face
Slayer: I don’t care if your the damn second coming. I want my title. I wanna know why I made the previous world champion. Tap out, TWICE. and I’M not the #1 contender
Clausen: Fine, Slayer you are now the #2 contender. Happy? Now if you don’t mind. I’d suggest Colgate, Crest maybe.
Clausen walks away
Joel Gertner holding his throat coughing

*The Truth Infantry backstage are talking to referee Danny Coleman. Ollafub is up front showing him some papers backstage. Blackman and Croyle shew away our cameraman recording their locker room

In ring: Romeo Roselli: this is the heavens crown championship. Last Sunday at Heatwave I announced that I will be holding the 7 minutes in Heaven Challenge so who wants to be the lucky first challenger

*A camera man gives his camera to another staff member and takes off all his wires and hops in the ring, telling Romeo to bring it
*Crowd is really into it*
Romeo looking around confused. Are you a camera man? You want to be the first challenger?
What is your name: My name is GG and I’ve been a camera man for XPW since this company started

M7: Romeo Roselli def. GG after the seven minute time limit expires but GG was actually in control of the match at the end of the time limit. Crowd chants GG! GG! GG!

Romeo attacks him with a fluorescent light tube in the crowd and scars his head in the audience stands
Romeo: you will not embarrass me
(Romeo throws GG into a trash can  and pushes it down the stadium stairs
Romeo: you will not make a mockery of me

(Romeo grabs his title and walks to the back)

Video Package: Joe Gacy & Kirby Lee Covington
(small boy on a playground swinging on swing set)
We are a disease
Plagueground is coming

M8: The Truth Infantry w/ Olaffub def. TakaNaka, Rey Mysterio, Pac, and Ruckus

high spot of the match takes place when Rey Mysterio pins Croyle for a 3 count, Ruckus pins Blackman for a 3 and Taka pins Edwards for a 3 and Danny just gives them a weird look
(commentary is confused, the crowd is confused chanting you fucked up, bullshit)

eventually Troy Clausen and Joel Gertner run on down, Troy calls for Danny. Olaffub eavesdrops over smiling. Danny audibly says “I’m just doing my job, doing what I’m told”. The match still awkwrdly going on at this point. Blackman rolls up Tanaka and Danny counts the 1-2-3
Clausen is like what now that 3 count applies
*bell rings
and your winner: The Truth Infantry
(crowd is confused)
Truth Infantry powders up the ramp with Olaffub jumping up and down for joy, so much in fact his pony tail comes undone.
Troy: Referee Danny Coleman should not be judged for his officiating. Unlike Mick Foley he’s not a biased ref. You see this is the reaction we all wanted. I thought maybe Heatwave would be when the world would find out The Truth!!!
Clausen and the opponents in the ring stare intently
Olaffub: When XPWEW reformed. I went through these re-sign contracts of all my clients in deep deep detail. I noticed so many loose loop holes here and I made a few minor changes. I thought you were a legal Troy Clausen, I guess not haha
I read the trades :)
I adjusted the contracts of Blackman, Croyle and Eddie Edwards. That’s right
I skewed just one little thing. These contracts were so loose honestly it may have took….5 minutes hahahaha
(Infantry laughs in unison)
My clients don’t apply to the referees count of 3. In the contracts of my clients. It says clearly and Troy you signed off on all of these. Hell, I don’t even think you read them. I probably could have gotten away with putting a little more zeros on the salaries. Honestly. Troy you are a joke. A negotiating failure. A jagaloon of jargon. Troy my clients must be pinned to the count of 5. to be beaten in that ring. and now these contracts are water tight. And if you were so clevar to just I don’t know fire us on the spot. Good luck, I’ll see you in court if you try because these contracts not only oblige my clients to be beaten with the count of 5. These are guaranteed iron clad contracts. Sealed. You and everyone have made fun of my client Steve Blackman, calling him a thing of the past, a shell of himself. Steve Blackman is more intense with age. More focused and the same applies for Edwards and Croyle as well. My men are focused and now they have the ultimate edge and you or anyone in the back can’t do a damn thing about it. We are here to capture all the gold, and were out for destruction. What Edwards did to Robbie Williams was only the prologue to the story that is THE TRUTH!!! Thnank you Thank you!4Embed"

Got a brand new all-gold shin, Akuma hangin' from my neck to my dick
You might also like[Interlude: Denzel Curry]
Live and direct out your bitch pussy
This your boy Denzel Curry in this ho
A.K.A. Zeltron, A.K.A. Big Ultra
Y'all niggas don't know what the fuck it is
When a real nigga step into a room with some alligator shoes on
'Cause you know we straight out the swamp, straight out the Everglades
Out of Florida, bitch-ass nigga
You feel me? Dade County, Get Sprayed County
Lauderdale or Slaughterdale
You already know what the fuck it is
Ayy, Peggy, let me talk to 'em one time, hold up

[Verse 2: JPEGMAFIA]
Niggas be beggin' for shit to be different until they get it, then they treat it indifferent
People projectin' they bullshit at you 'cause they dissatisfied with the life that they living
Niggas' net worth be like seventeen bucks while they begging for feet pics from shortys I been in
I can sniff out you proximity hoes, always near some shit going on but never did it
I don’t understand when people talk shit on me, they gotta lead with a lie or some fibbing
Friends acting like they don't wanna talk, then start begging for change, I don't know what it's giving
Niggas be tryin' to fuck on your bitch while they dappin' you up sayin', ""I see your vision""
Fake friends turning on me for nothing, they mad 'cause they failed even with an advantage
This is my fight, I just woke up as a child of the light
Jumped on the beat, had to tell it, ""Goodnight""
Y'all tried your best but the heat aimin' right
Kimber OG, I'm as high as a kite
Shop for success, well, I brought me a pint
Watch how I whip, I ain't stir-fry the rice
Get your head cracked just for rollin' the dice, uh
Now don't believe hype
Believe what you see, not what's said on the mic
Peggy Chun-Li, I kick out every time
Can't keep me down, so they try block the shine
Try fuck with my money, try fuck with my mind
Then acting like fucking they bitch is a crime
This ain't relatable, this ain't debatable
Somethin' happened to you, it's by design, shh
[Interlude: JPEGMAFIA]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, man
JPEG motherfuckin' MAFIA
Makin' grown men emotional since 2008, at least
Now, walk around everywhere as me, you know
And you never catch me out here lookin' like these dirty-ass underground rappers
Locked in the Airbnb somewhere with a bunch of niggas, playin' with each other's dicks
Zero women around, loopin' records nobody wants to hear

[Verse 3: JPEGMAFIA]
Uh, look
On my knees for a God who can hear
I can't pray to no God I can't fear
I think I should have ran me a cult
Quarterback that ho like I'm Peyton on Colts
Fuck-niggas yappin' 'bout me on they alt
But when I see you, it's degrees of assault
You said you see him, you catching a case?
I hope not like the one you got in your vault
'Cause that shit is shaky
Heard the church service said, ""Come as you are""
So I showed up with a whole bunch of bitches that hate me
Told my main bitch to stop actin' expensive
Girl, pass me the mic, you as clueless as Stacy
I know that time heals wounds, but my time is money and I can't use time as saline
Pray, for all of my enemies, they either dead or hating, literally faking
Lame-ass niggas get exposed everyday and I don't gotta do nothing more than frustrate him
He's not a threat, bitch, I'm on him, a vet
I had marksman in basic, I never need training
Ayy, they make a career from hating
Ayy, they make a career from faking
I shit-talked my way right into a bag
You pussy in private, beg him for collabs
You pillow-talkin' to these bitches, it's sad
I don't know whether to slap you or laugh
Shower posse, give that baby a bath
I know your label saw a cash grab
You got popped then turned hashtag
Stop yappin' online 'cause you know where I'm at, lil' bitch
Fuck nigga1Embed"
Black M,Babylon,"1 ContributorBlack Money LyricsWe built this house on love and trust
On something more than bricks and dust
Now we're running down the clock
Waiting for the aftershock

We started out with things to do
Hopes and dreams to pull us through
Now everything is called to doubt
Not much left to dream about

Black money breathes black money crawls
Black money lives inside these walls

It's never really if so much as when
The greed that chills the empty hearts of men
To sate a rich man's vanity they're laying waste to history
The thieves have entered Babylon again

Black money breathes black money crawls
Black money lives inside these walls

The politicians tell us how
It's time to milk the sacred cow
They drop their bombs where children play
Then say it has to be that way

Tell me what you niggas know bout niggas like me
Rollin' K.O.D. while on LSD
Tell me what ya'll niggas know bout niggas like me
Rollin' K.O.D. while on LSD
I'm fried, I'm in my zone
I got that kush, I got Patron
I got that weed, and LSD
And your bitch just popped a molly
I'm fried, I'm in my zone
I got that kush, I got Patron
I got that weed, and LSD
And your bitch just popped a molly

[Verse]
I be the universe gangster, runnin' through your damn block
Click, clack, poppin', that's the sound of the grey matter Glock
So I be Aquarius killa, that nigga guerrilla when runnin' up
Alaska in my heart so who gon' tell me that I give a fuck
Or what Goddess that I'm smashin' when I leave the club
Angel, soarin' through the dancefloor like a kokita
God damn, really when the mother nature got us up in my galaxy
Lavishly, livin' in the mansion where we play Grey's Anatomy
Doctor, I am so proper, look at the posture
I'll cross her, and finally caught her but then I lost her
Found her, a close encounter, over-the-counter
I bounce her, I wouldn't play her cause I'm not Bowser
Arouse her, gave her a heart, drop dollars and browsers
Amped up, I think we stamped up, she's in my trousers
Wowsers, she's at the tower, peek in the shower
The flowers become the power within the hour
Cowards, spaces to outer, green as the outer
Glow, after I'm stickin' my dick in this ho, beggin' for mo', woah
Woah, slow down, she thought I was destroyin' her
She likes the way it feels when she's searchin' for euphoria

On acid tabs, shawty with a chick that look like Gloria

Shake that ass just like a conga when you get a nigga high

Black M,BALD REMIX,"1 ContributorBlack Boy (Madlib Remix) Lyrics[Intro: Cappadonna]
Blast— blast— blast out darts in the Wu basement
Ahhh— (Ahhh—)
Word up, it's a beautiful day (Ahhh—)

[Verse 1: Cappadonna]
Aiyyo, call me a cab, it's the Razor Sharp kid
Dipped everyday my style is po-lit'
I'm out to the Mansion, I gots to catch Ghost
I'm headed to the club tonight, we need toast
For that wack ass MC, talking all the shit
I know we can't wait just to get his wig split
It's war with the Gods this year, represent
The bitch-ass niggas keep trying to repent
But we still licking off, we wild like 2 Cent
Park Hill Projects, say it with your lungs
Fuck y'all, cats, we always got guns
But just in case, we get drunk and can't drive
We gotta fuck something up
Dead or alive y'all coming with us
We live on thе other side of the chart
Whеre your mother met Poppa Wu (Poppa Wu)

[Verse 2: Cappadonna]
After the tour I came back for more
Coming correctly, just like before
""Wu-Tang Forever"" I was just a pirate
In the rec room regulating with Osirus
Deep thoughts, I don't take no shorts
Minds on lease like expensive imports
Elevate the seed, no lust or greed
Living life long time may continue to breed
Never getting caught up inside the agencies
For ten long years, but I paid my fee
Now I'm on the frontline with W.T.C. 
Back me down these streets are still ill
From Brownsville all the way down in Park Hill
Pack with the beef cause niggas won't chill
Cats smoked out like chicken on the grill
I'm taking this shit way back to Bill Bill
In the projects where my man got killed
You might also like[Verse 3: Cappadonna]
Bloods accumulating, we getting impatient
Knowledge and Wisdom, teach the understanding
That's how I'm planning, blow up like a cannon
Pull my man in, hit y'all again
Now I make sense, we do this for the rent
Build with intelligence break your defense
No hesitation, time gets spent…
I can't never stop 'til my heart is content

Anti-American, I'm pro-Assata
Write rhymes like a scholar, all about a dollar
Dollar equals Allah, put away the scouters
You won't see my power, this your final hour
On Nefertiti, this is for the city
Cut throat, you shouldn't fuck with my committee
Kill it, call it Kenny, say it came from Diddy
All you other rappers hella Pooh, no Winnie
Eeny, meeny, miney, moe, tic-tac-toe
Leave a XO on a death note I wrote
Flow on a back stroke in my black clothes
I'm a asshole, got ghost out the atmos
Fear me, departed them now they fear me
You want a war, bring the gear please
Murdering everyone yearly, sincerely, ultimate

Never watered down, my niggas on some killin' shit

Born baller, baby boy, I be above the rim
Quick step, then I plant, just like I'm Durant
Peyton Manning with the poems, go look at the stats
Went from sleepin' on the floor to pissin' Moët
All my teachers sellin' dope, even sold me a sack
Wake up in the mornin', so I need to smoke
When I really need to keep my queen close
MAC-11, dirty money on my prayer rug
Say a prayer for me, really show a player love
Time to touch a million, did it with finesse
Never wait up for me, go and get your rest

They back on the rampage, like Quentin
Shippin' 'em off to San Quentin
Ran wicked with some niggas on the block
Still stickin' on the beam

Workin' later, so I'm sendin' a message off to my queen
If I don't make it out alive, you and I
Is the only thing important to me, in case I die
Message received, she's a blessing indeed
Make sure I put something away for when she carry my seed
For my unborn son, I got a few words left
Be better than me, and everything, on my last dyin' breath, ah

Can't fuck with the south with a AK-forty-seven bumping T Double-D (Double D, nigga!)
First forty-eight, gotta say it one time, R.I.P. my nigga Bizzle (Bizzle!...,,,bizzle)
Kick, drill, ravish of a nigga think he savage, turn him to a popsicle
That's ""Ice...COLD!"", and my last name ain't three-thousand (3000)
Bad ass bitch on my t.i.p. (Tip Harris), she wet, like an everlasting fountain
Still a Hot Boy, ‘bout whatever like, Turk or Wayne, like a motherfuckin' Carter
Niggas water whipping, in the hot damn kitchen, like a nigga Avatar, or Katara
Remember that it's still fuck the other side, lurking all black, like that boy Plies
Snapping, like a fat ho at the Popeye's when she don't get the thigh, the chicken, or the fries
So nigga what it be? I can turn my shirt to a ski, fuck feds, not even Ice T
Wanna come and ice me, like it's New Jack City,shit looking grim - no Mandy, Billy

I'm rocking 'bout four types of polo, you peep that my style it must be Armageddon
Apocalypse stop, pop the clip, better bow down now it's all about power
Fantasy darker than Swishers, the wicked demented, get hit with the mystical shower
Now that's dan-ger grab, on the ban-ger, take down the empire bruh
In the hood jits robbin', like Williams,let's hope that they'll never doubt fire
Niggas be knocking no cabbage, no UPS person, so tell me what's up with the S?
Slithery snakes, with they slithery tongues, salivating salvations with shit on your head
Yes, Curry gone mash on these cowards
With shells to they back like they Bowser, spit fire -  no flower
Get smoke, like the OG and sour then head up to Broward
You know when the bass turn up louder, 'bout loud as the dro, get to the door
I'm shroomed out my mental, like Mario Bros
I'm seeing the walls start to kaleidoscope, so I'm guessing that already means that I'm gone
It's quite striking that, haters won't tell the truth in front of your face
Not the same time, not the same place, so they hate from a greater distance far away
You see them in person look 'em in the eye, and they say that  that wasn't the case
Y'all can suck a dick in advance
Like Rich Homie Quan, get the fuck out my face...bitch
[Chorus]
I'mma keep balling, 'til they envy me
21 guns, for my enemies
Niggas got some, ho ass tendencies
Cash out, I'm ballin', til they envy me
My enemies, motherfuck my enemies
Cause I'ma keep ballin', til they envy me
My enemies, motherfuck my enemies
Cause, I'ma keep ballin', til they envy me

Lord Vader Kush
Staying all black
Niggas wanna be with it in a gang
Roll up on a sucker hit him with the click clack
3-2 Zel
Anakin Skywalker pack
Burn a motherfucker to the ashes
Make sure a pig don't come back
Fuck niggas envy me because I'ma ball
6 man shawty I'ma ball until I fall
Fuck niggas they envy me cause I'ma ball
6 man shawty I'ma ball until I fall
(Bitch)

[Verse 1]
I put them L's in the sky, like a nigga sticking up Jésus
Arnold Schwarzenegger any nigga chillin' with her
Black bitch fuck around her might erase you
Flat land bounce that I walk on
Sometimes I never seem to walk home
47th Ave down 17th Ave like Rudy Tabootie you in a Chalk Zone
All Chicago niggas got 30's, Dade County niggas got K's
Carol City nigga from the route,in a stadium, start shit in a 3-2 lane
I can show motherfuckers that feel my pain, Uzumaki upon the terrain
Niggas killing niggas over bitches, but my nigga this ain't the Django Unchained
Shot like Jamie Foxx got the neighborhood watch thinkin' they the fuckin' cops
Shoot a nigga pop, pop, pop
Damn, but he gets off innocent shots shots
Time to expose all of the god damn have-nots
Curry, how does the primitive weaponry
Risen from nothing but short hand built legacy
Honestly it will be done to the death of me
Serving no Jeffrey
Prince of the Rebel fleets

Fertilize it with a dab whenever you split the 'gar

Stand out like super models in a room with Chris Bosh

Best of both sides, I'm a walking talking spliff
On another level nigga I am [?] you a chef
Like meet me in the shower you better get a grip on life
Killa clan destined looking for Lotto and astral projection
On the other side with a Jesus piece flexin'

It's ironic how it's crabs in the bucket but I'm coming from the sea
Snapping at me, the poetry
Dead on the street 'cause they lost in hate
Jit wanna get his stripes, eat some Frosted Flakes
Off to say communities we have no place
Even though the real victim is who caught the case
My Golden State all about the green, Draymond
Stay away from being a convict, Akon
Come to Carol City where the fun don't end
Till a nigga get to dumping like an ex-girlfriend
Stay in, bow your head we prayin'
For a bad bitch able to come on the weekend (uh!)
And if I said it I did it in pretense (uh!)
If you don't get it then please just pretend
I spied through my mahogany brown eyes

Body scars put the pain in my heartbeat so I gotta drop ether
We touch the soul because we young niggas that gotta eat
They perpetrating promoting the shit they gotta reap
My family is the reason that I even speak
Every decent memory of people still be living shife
And you ain't really gotta die to lose your life
Think about it, it's a lot of niggas living outta sight

When I flow, I drop bombs like a Soviet
Not a communist, but I'm anonymous
Zero tolerance if niggas talking shit
Now you talking, the end of the partnership
Had to cut that bitch off
Send that bitch off with a fucking sawed-off
Being too nice isn't giving a fuck
'Cause these internet niggas be thinking I'm soft
What are you, lost? Come down the one way
I don't fuck with none of you niggas the long way
Stepping to the Ultimate is the wrong way
I'm a real ass nigga, y'all boys is anime
Characters, I will embarrass you
You don't want war in this game, ain't no challenger, boy
Rather get paper and stack it, my boy
With a bad bitch in a Challenger, boy

Back in the day when a nigga trip six
Now a nigga trip scene
On the Internet tip
Let's talk about the Internet chick
Let me get back on topic
On how Curry was the top pick
To hold the whole sun in his hands till he drops hot shit
I got the game interlocked swift in a box sucked in
'Cause I'm thinking outside of it
That's how I got a house and a whip
Some niggas shout, ""Fuck,"" for the cream
Floss like a river at the dentist
Lifestyle imaginary who will fuck your image
All you niggas only in it for the motherfucking scrimmage
Put that on lotto mane
Why all them niggas all sound the same
Like pinky you better use your brain
Focus on the past only make you lame
Black metal jackets full metal jackets
Fucking with the kilo like Allen, I'm blasting
Thinking about my passion I'm sick of being passive
Pastor you ain't even got the fucking answers

Come wit' it now
Come wit' it now

[Verse 1]
The microphone explodes, shattering the mold
Either drop the hits like de la O or get the fuck off the commode
With the sure shot, sure to make a body drop
Drop and don't copy, yo, don't call this a co-op
Terror rains drenchin', quenchin' the thirst
Of the power don, that five-sided Fistagon
The rotten sore on the face of Mother Earth gets bigger
The triggers cold, empty your purse

[Chorus]
Rally 'round the family
With a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family
With a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family
With a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family
With a pocket full of shells

[Verse 2]
Weapons, not food, not homes, not shoes
No need, just feed the war, cannibal animal
I walk the corner to the rubble, that used to be a library
Line up to the mind cemetery, now
What we don't know keep the contracts alive and moving
They don't gotta burn the books, they just remove 'em
While arms warehouses fill as quick as the cells
Rally 'round the family, pocket full of shells

Listen, birds chirpin', dogs barkin', kids missin', milk cartons
Soul dark as black markets, war is startin', more is sparkin'
Glory prophets praise Muhammad
""Diff'rent Strokes,"" Philip Drummond
Gave me crack, like I'm plumbin', Jesus Christ, second comin'
Cut myself, now I'm numbin', never scared, never runnin'
Chosen one, I'm one hunnid, pray for me, pray for London
Guilty me, he ain't done and gun me down, all for nothin'
Precedent in abundance, president is a puppet
Gotta hate it, gotta love it, pass a class, I rise above it
Wise enough, advise the public, pistol bust, screamin', ""Fuck it""
Donald Trump, Donald Duck, what the fuck is the difference?
Now, we stuck in a rut, this ain't what I envisioned
What is what? What is guts when you don't have intuition?
Not a saint, not a sin, tell me, what's my real religion?
Genocide, Genesis, they say it's a new beginning
I'm a sinner, you a sinner, I can see the devil grinning

So much trouble on the streets that we need to buy a AK

We ain't tryna get sick, so we walk around with no face

Cold world, cold world, we don't even got a North Face

Got me bein' honest with my savior
Keep that sinnin' away from me, yeah
Shit is hard to stomach, I can't even vomit
Pour up gin and tonic just to calm my conscience
Wonderin' on every second, I wanna leave, yeah
Forced to be mellow, see my common fellow
Told him ""Keep your distance"" can't even say ""Hello""
It struck me harder than a bow and arrow

Can't fuck with government, what can I say?
Caught me some other shit, can't fall in love with it
I say a prayer to not be the prey
Hoes with the drama OD
Then they turn around and throw they drama on me
These are the only reasons why I stay lowkey
And I knew this world was shitty when we lost Kobe

Chained to my vessel, saw freedom in meditation
Usin' medication would make the perfect escapist
They unprestigious, I got angels in my allegiance
My demons would look for sin like junkies feelin' fiendish
The meanest streets I walk in, these size elevens I stalk
Not carin' if I'm rich or if I'm surrounded by chalk
I could either live like Jay or die like Jah
Alhamdulillah, let Jehovah judge me on my flaws
My word is law, forever stick to the code
Stay bold and to switch it up when things grow old
All I have in this world is my heart and my soul
Lay my life down for it 'cause they both made of gold
Twenty-four karats, twenty-five and countin', twenty-four hours
Days not promised, but for now, never send flowers

Angels keep singing, gotta get through all this

Actin' like my day ones, nigga, you're just posin'

Smile in my face, then go and pillow talk to a bitch (What did you say?)
Word got back to me, so it is what it is
I don't fuck with no man who don't take care of his kids
Off-topic, out of pocket, all these niggas is trash
Fightin' for crumbs of fame and some thot with an ass, fuck 'em
Plan, plot, strategize, it's the task, I realize, right before I bomb first
You don't gotta love me, respect me, and fear me
And yes, you gotta fade me if worst come to worst
'Cause love could get you killed, playin' the victim get you bullied

I spit on behalf of my death cult made of millions of morbid angels
Standing in a burning church in Norway lost in hatred
Of course Satan smiles through the face of a child
Who's born with the number of the Devil scraped into his scalp
We don’t like none of y’all at all
My 'Fuck your mother in the mouth' type of dawgs might write this song
Triple X bitches call me and invite me home
They run up on me on the street in then invite me dome
I spit the truth for the youth movement, it’s goon music
Engineered to make you bang your motherfucking head to it
Earn chips, live fast lives and spit flames
Then burn bitches with crackpipes like Rick James
Ill Bill, I’m from Brooklyn where the stars are born
I make drug music plus I be involved in porn
I be the chosen like Robby Benson beyond comprehension
Holding a toaster like Bronson in Death Wish

Hook (x2)

I break speed limits on the highway to Hell
They got the Devil chasing me trying to give me life without bail
I drink spirits and smoke form for medicine
And inhale elements of sickle cell
You can catch me in the hood like VD
That Sixth Side Street shit homes and we ain’t deal with the PD
The most hated on the block with no greatest
Crash through the storm and attack the storm raiders
I shoot the shit with Shaman, my spirit is still starving
Imagine all the shit that my soul famine is causing
Knife-carving nine on the psychos at night swarming
I fight to be righteous but the murder is more calm

Verse 3 (Q-Unique):

I been forced to fulfill a dark and hateful agarro
And was born the son of a Satan santero
Burn black candles for a black Sabbath
After the fact the priest converted her to a crack addict
It’s flat madness with black gats and black magic
Sit and watch the death of faces and laugh at it
With two white pale goth bitches lost in an orgy
And you too could subscribe for the cost of a forty
I got the blood of the faceless pagans on me
A sacred place praying to raise a Haitians army
The Babalawo wolf from Brooklyn in all white
White fitted, white Nikes, moving that pure white all night
Make a bruha scream chango and fuck their brains out
Your ice crucifix won’t save you, tuck your chains now
Between heaven and hell, pa’ arriba y pa’ abajo

Yeah, huh

[Verse 1]
My mind is a playing field for mental arguments
My thoughts are sayin' my emotions is who started it
My personality always conflicts with other people
The good in me has never been conscious of seein' evil
I could be ferocious in my times of feelin' feeble
Sick of life's ills, it could be short for illegal
Common sense, a victim to sensory deprivation
The mediator met with it all is in meditation
Lord invited me to stay idly on his left side
So I can right my wrongs in these songs to live and let die
Channellin' Notorious, Makaveli and Left Eye
Son of Ra, speakin' on Horus to see who am I?
Topple leaders, runnin' with demons, cunnin' and thievin' always
Silhouette-surfin' and stretchin' through mental hallways
Demons on my mind, they know where to hide, really
Then nine minutes later, I'm met with the nine milli'
So nine times out of ten, I'm probably going to Hell
'Cause I'm the devil, which means I sold my soul to myself
Shelf all of my worst fears in the mason jar glasses
Next to all the dreams and things I ever imagined
Book of magic, Seal of Solomon, it's a talisman
Speak my name in vain, it will be met with some challenges
I devise a way to rise, time to strategize
The purest form of Zeltron made me alkaline

The kid inside me always seems to man up
The higher power is within myself, no need to pan up
Believe in U-L-T the way a child believes in Santa
Manipulate the masses and the media on camera
Black holes and white lights, white noise and black sun
Shadows and bright lights eclipse back in action
Surrounded by dismay, I display visions of a way
For Heaven on Earth and hell on Earth to fight for night and day
Apocalyptic hoes conflict against my optimistic hopes
The ropes around my neck are golden chains for me to choke
My locs reflect the locks and the flames that burn across
In my very nation, I walk with my peers, surrounded by chalk
Deities and darkness meetin' at my dinner table
Deeper than rap, my life is real, this is my mystic fable
Play the bad guy just to finish the race first
'Cause the last guy was nice, but he end up dying of thirst

Leave her all white and jizzy, it's a Posh Gang nigga
Last Fall I was out in New York doing art and fucking bitches
Don't give a fuck who you are, it's all about the Benji's
At the Aventura Mall in Miami bitches got the new Huaraches
Pocketbook on Illuminati
Wrist a bitch like a moist towelette
That jizz walk is the whole body
That pussy profit I know bout it!
[Verse 3: Denzel Curry]

Pussy profit, get the pussy's poppin'
Fuck them sugar daddy's on that bitch that from college
(ULTIMATE)
I get it in any means, regardless
'Cause I'm hella heartless, locking down the gauntlet
(ULTIMATE)
You betta feel me, get crackin' on Benjamins
If it's no dividends
Then I'm sorry there's no house that you living in
Throw ink in remembrance
You will be livin' inside of my thoughts
'Cause you just a thot
Trust my only thought

Time for me to plot at rappers throwin' shots

Askin' me where I be
I'm somewhere where the hoes be
This is where I'm supposed to be

Anytime that I can take

Oh, how hard it's been

The world is darker than thе integration of a Brooklyn Dodger
All I need is me, mysеlf and I and also my revolver
Crackers out here shootin' joggers, trouble makin' firestarters
Still get paid to solve our problems, him or me, I guess I pop him
Way before he shoot, I shot 'em, plottin' from the get then got 'em
911, emergency will murder me the day I call 'em
Now they got me livin' lawless, been the furthest thing from flawless
They ain't fuck with niggas since the greatest of the grandfathers bought 'em
So much pain I've endured, now I'm painless
I got the juice, my only friend is my stainless
My little weapon gave me power when I aimed it (Bwah)
This for my niggas in the struggle, let us sing, sing

[Verse 1: Denzel Curry]
Gold bullet that's trapped in his temple
Was just the beginning of a deranged mental
The mind wasn't simple, the man wasn't gentle
They bust out the brain but got caught in the dimple
To bust out the dental, the tooth full of wisdom
With black on black tints, they jet in the rental
The young mane hearing the whisper of Sindel
With a gift since birth, if you answer this riddle: Who I be?
The fetus of a demon
Semen from the tip
Of the penis I'm the only thing
That you see when you're dreaming
Armageddon and aftermath
This may blog in paragraphs
Sit on a throne, full of X's and bones
Blowing smoke and I laugh
Turning sinners like you
Into my personal acid tabs
Let me put you up on game
I've been shot, burned, and stabbed, and
Still ain't deceased
I carry the mark of the beast
Now can you tell me
Who the fuck I be?
Damien, as the kid replies
Wine, red wine was the color of his eyes
Coughing a lot of blood like Piru, but he slowly dies
As his eyes close shut, in prison was his eternal life

[Verse 2: Lil Ugly Mane]
He thought he wanted seven digits, the thickest bitches, the top position
Tried to make a profit off the poverty he lives in
Atrocities committed on the blocks that he got kids in
And now he pops prescriptions, he's in prison to suspicions
He fucked the Devil's daughter, now he pissed away forgiveness
Only sounds he hears are shots popping in the distance
Thinking that they coming, now he haunted by these visions
He knows that there's a dark, and a light, but he don't know the difference
He used to run around bangin', man, he love the shit
And now he sit around, waitin' for his punishment
Cops on some old beef, that's why he gotta hold heat
He's stuntin' like his daddy, even pops had the gold teeth
But pops went to prison back in '03
So lil man never got to listen to a OG
Never got to tell him other options that you don't see
So lil man grew up thinking prison where he supposed to be, Ugly
[Hook: Denzel Curry]
And now that nigga scream like he Sindel
Yelling 'suicide' in his prison cell
Running with them demons since the age of 12

[Verse 3: Mike G]
For the scene, see the best is never seen
They say I lack in appearances, but they lack in experience
I remain quiet like I'm in constant meditation
Only way to get in my place is expert and constant observation, nigga
Never compete, much less be winner at it
Seven days a week, I found my sinister
I control my perimeter, patrol isn't giving up
Every effort you attempt never amounts to enough
They talk around you, but you know you can't give in
And you part of the system, so they treat you just like them
Every action is countered, so just don't disturb my zen
Every student with honor knows you must deserve lessons, yeah
I roll with what every character should have
That's why I'm equipped with a black suit and mask, I blast
Now it's silent like when the Earth had begun

All because we niggas that be livin' in the projects

Put 'em in the bars when they didn't do shit

They think they're living in a police state and they become hostile toward the policemen
And why they wanna get rid of me? Because I'm saying something that might wake up other exploited people and some depressed people and if all these people ever get together, then these pigs that are exploiting us we'll be able to run them into the lake. That's why they wanna get rid of us

Inside the fountain of youth, surroundin' the booth is water

Born of the resistance that birthed me
Made music of everything
Is somebody recording these cries?
Bodies blown through concrete, nobody based in that
Bombs, buildings crumbling
Repetitive gunfire got bass in it, but the cries drowned it out
Sampled bomb blast in the Pacific and let it run to the earthquake on the other side, looped it
Below screams was fire
Harpoons and everything
Radiation make it sound analog
Needed somethin' death could dance to
Changed my whole style up, so used to the slickness
Sorrow streamlined into story
Dancing alone in front of speakers my whole life9Embed"

Baby
Ronny J, listen up

[Chorus]
Are you pure enough
To keep it real with yourself when you in the mirror, bruh?
Or when you all alone, girl, are you sure enough?
Keep it G is the key and that is the cure for us
You said you had enough
Are you pure enough?
To keep it real with yourself when you in the mirror, cuz?
When you all alone girl are you sure enough?
Keep it G is the key and that is the cure for us
You said you had enough
Girl, are you sure enough?

[Verse 1]
February sixteenth, is the day I regret my birth
Most times I thought about endin' it when I came into this Earth
Compared to Dracula, the man in the mirror I see is nothing
Reflecting on all of the bitches I got but none of them love me
Like the woman I donated my heart to without the surgery
Charity, short-term goals is longevity
Keeping it G is the key, and I told you that's the cure for us
When the tears fall down your eyes, you ask yourself

[Verse 2]
February fourteenth is just the day to repopulate
I never have no love south side of the Florida state
Love me for who I am, never love me for what I make
I travel around the world and yes I drove on the interstate
Niggas would though I was fraudulent? Everything is politics
When coal turn into diamonds people want to praise and acknowledge it
Always quick to polish it, but quickly let me go
Happened to that young nigga with the nappy afro
He died around the same time that Lotto did
Now it's 2016 and I know what the motto is and
I don't need no Aubrey Graham just to make a hit
That's just another view from my iPhone 6
Free Mr. Zone 6, I know Guwop is coming home
Just another Aquarius that you hate to the bone
You wanna be a thug, but you won't live in harmony
Lazy, I'm crazy, I'm wishing that a nigga start with me
Last year just made a nigga less friendly, approaching my adversaries
I know that people envy, my soul is still empty
All I see is pussies talking shit with they homeboys
That's a modern day Ren & Stimpy
Girls wanna be classy but still dress skimpy not giving a fuck simply
Then wonder why people think you're an escort
Keeping it G is the key and you know that be the cure for us
Mirror pieces fall and reflect on your life and ask
[Chorus]
Are you pure enough
To keep it real with yourself when you in the mirror, bruh?
Or when you all alone, girl, are you sure enough?
Keep it G is the key and that is the cure for us
You said you had enough
Are you pure enough?

Black M,Pig Feet,"1 ContributorPig Feet LIVE Lyrics[Intro: Denzel Curry]
Welcome to the day niggas took over

[Verse 1: Denzel Curry]
Helicopters over my balcony
If the police can't harass, they wanna smoke every ounce of me
Breath is alchemy, see how my life converted
They say that life's a female dog, well I'm perverted
Go to jail and get murdered
Murder was the case they gave us
Manipulate the system so the prison could slave us, ayy
Nothin' can save us
Foot Lockеr, liquor stores, undercovers bringin' hordеs
Ten years plus four, little kids die at war
Mama want me baptized, swimmin' in the blood shore
Shut down schools to open guns and drug stores
Seems like the floor gotta flourish
When I'm readin' my horoscope, the vision is horrid
But you be soarin', stay woke
Rather live rich than stay broke
I'm starin' though my rearview in my pitch-black locs
My notes disappear, reappear, shit is wicked here
Tragedy all over the screen like William Shakespeare plays
Disease, the grade, increase grenades
Disease, the AIDS, I seize today
Like Wade, I fade away
I pray today, 'cause life is crazy
JAY-Z, a school of hard knocks
They want us crucified with stones and hard rocks, come on!
You might also like[Verse 2: G Perico]
Uh, yeah, look, uh, yeah
I got a different reality
The cops ain't the only one that's pointing they gats at me
The government puttin' all this pressure on back of me
My friends wanna kill me for success that I acheived
So I'm all by myself around everybody
Till somebody from the other side come catch a body
Yeah, somethin' gotta change
The prison industry is making everybody slaves
The people that own the prisons is also making a loss
The gross of the prison system is over 7 billion dollars
Uh, so I'm trapped by the pigs
Feet poored out the car, laid flat by the pigs feet

[Verse 3: Daylyt]
Uh, see all we are VR'd, sleep in a snooze
Peeking at deacons keepin' the rules
Creepin' in rooms
Sneakin' cheeks for the doom, cats kiddin' me
Little cats killed literally
How these cats talk bigotry?
Like an Avatar forest, the machine talk, Jarvis
Whatever they hand you, it'll be y'all risk
Your hand stuck in the cookie jar, hold on to the sweet shit, beef shit
Green jackets, the old cats, feel the heat cliff, eclipse
Blacks cover the white light, cats stuck in the twilight
Why, Lyt? See, the wise life stuck in hindsight
Sign bright, read, catch up, it's monumental, don't mind your men
Mind you, in my mind intertwined you, men sign you in
Don't get no autograph from Patrick
Just collapsed shit
But don't run from Cleopatra
Perhaps you sleep, your mattress weak
Stuck like a statue, is that you geeks?
We attack you, don't act too street
We gon' ask you-
Bring the cops out, bring the cop-out
You see the pigment
We depict, the indigenous people-
Hold on to life, we don't go for the house of reps
They done trapped us in the alphabet
Our alphas can't get out the net
'Net ballin', imaginary goal
Shot clock, what's your net worth?
Chris Webber? Mmm, deep webber? Mmm
Time out, mom's house, etymology, mortgage die route
Be lesbian, buddy, you better study
Puddy holes on this muddy road
Buddy cold
They gon' pay for takin' my brother
Nas say we need one mic and they shot the brown one
Y’all done forgot the brown one
The new white Mike
Rockin' a nightgown
It's ancient
They covered his passed with his kid blanket
Y'all sleep, y'all don't see how the image changed
Remember the times, nigga

Black M,HOODLUMZ,"7 ContributorsT.M. (Message to Killa Black) Lyrics""What price are you talking about, sir?""
Malcolm X: ""The price of freedom is death""

Yo
Only one sperm cell survives out of millions
Hustlers strive, the trades we learn by the buildings
In Hell's Kitchen - projects burn the children
Some get locked, lay in a box with no feeling
On my back staring at the ceiling, through dealing
Sweat dripping, hands together, my knees kneeling
Where was God when my pops fell to his death bleeding?
Was he trapped like Martin in his last cry for freedom?
And when I die, will my soul ride 'til I see him?
Never thought that I'd be overseas with Koreans
Rockin' a vest, pushin' bulletproof Europeans
In hot wheels - spit shit the crowd could feel
Spendin' chips on Halal meals, ripping foul steel
While snakes come behind me to lace my spine
Say grace and at the same time, embrace my nine
We ball like ghetto children in life tournaments
Lusting for platinum chains and ice ornaments
I strive for what I live for - cut from an iller cloth
Plot like Hyman Roth in a loft
Stack chips before the new millennium curse
U-N-I-Verse, we true and living heirs to the universe
Rep' the 41st 'til my heart burst
Ready to die - 'til we seen Biggie ride in a hearse
Yo, your comrades moving like wolves in sheep's clothing
Friends are foes - hanging niggas cause they holding
You might also like[Hook]
If you can't hold on, hang on - we can make it
Whatever they don't give us in this life, we can take it
Joy and pain - through the sunshine and rain
As the world turns, life remains the same
We escaped through the flames in this game we bled
Pour some liquor on the ground - God bless the dead
To my niggas still living, yo - hold your head
To my niggas still living, yo - hold your head

Yo, yo, yo
I blow shots from a drop rover 'til the world's over
Seeing Jehovah through the eyes of a young soldier
Black Moses - literature in pure dosage
From a landscape of Kuwait - Jakes and vultures
Too many of us lose focus
Due to the fact that we're all just a bunch of soldiers
Foul cultures
Funny how the streets mold us
Allah told us - in the cages where they hold us, it's much colder
Hear the pain through my words as I [?] in song
See, the world's rotten like the veins in my father's arm
Used to be a follower of Islam - niggas is sheist'
Study my life - living in these days is trife
Heaven and Hell, a thin line between paradise
Rather than lose, some choose to take they own life
Said a prayer for him, hoping that his soul was blessed
Cause my hands couldn't cover all the holes in his chest
What they do? Turn around and blame me for his death
I'm like Malcolm X resurrected in a Lex', holding two tecs
Holograms in the headrest, yo
Shoulda knew what love is, before he learned what a thug is
Now we leave the seeds to be raised by their mothers
I've seen the 'hood raise brothers
Kill too many of us
A thin line between the freedom and the foul judges
In the streets, where them snake niggas hold grudges

Make sure the enemy can die in advance
I follow God, not the words of a man
I got blood on my sword and my hands
We go to war, I won't give you the chance

Then pick a time to engage so you can feel my rage

Expose those beyond hoes
Treat them like they made a mistake, that's what they all chose
Explode your head, you already dead
So you don't gotta ask why I had to make bloodshed

Black M,Say Ya Grace,"1 ContributorPrez Mafia vs. Dre Dennis Lyrics[Round 1: Prez Mafia]
First off, I told Murda this ain't a battle about no PG step, nigga, it's to see me reset
So let's get it done
This nigga talkin' all that, this and that
But denyin' the fact I'm a aristoc'at (aristocrat) (a risk to cat)
You kitten, son?
This nigga PG Step all the way to the top for this shit to plunge
And Daylyt stamps the shit
And you run with it
You dumb
In that moment, I noticed
Nigga, where'd you get it from?
Nigga, that style mine, and it got no name until I give it one
And I'm the biter, this writer shook
Like nigga, let's fight, and a life get took
A uppercut, mixed with a litle me, he gon' bite the hook
It's real herе
I took a verse, right?
But so what? Nigga, I ain't gonna steal hеre
That's why the gun so big, I left it home and it's still here
Nigga, look, quick question, which new team did you hear that I'm repping?
Nigga, I got a mind of my own, my conscious has holes, so for pretending not to murk ya section
I will go off
But nigga, as soon as I get to turn that weapon, and still (steel) do it again like, I ain't learned my lesson
You basic as shit, like I bet they gon' call Prez Mr. Hide My Bars
'cause he be takin' em shits, so that a hundred dollars and Mulatto Black and [?] gon' pay for the shit, but
Constipation, think about, he be making me sick
Nigga, I sat down on this round and pushed, I ain't takin' this shit
Nigga, fuck Dre
Nigga, I don't care what tool he got, or who he shot
Swear to God on RBE, you ain't Cash Capone a fuckin' booty pop, is that true or not?
Plus my dog Brian, he got a ruger cocked
[?]
So duck the lowest (Lois), or you gettin' Stuey (Stewie) shot
I said, this motherfucker don't like me point
And I get to blacking on screen like a Spike Lee joint
'Cause I heard that Bonus the shooter
And even Charles spray weapons
So if Dre don't take deep cover, it's a 187
Fuck a gun play reference, I may get in ya face
Like I saw your battle with Trez, the shit's a disgrace
Nigga, you punch for nothing, and got dragged in a miserable way
But welcome back Mr. Hide My Bars, I'm from the X and my niggas just been itching to sell Smack
You let 'em eat on the PGs, he think this shit's a buffet
But then the fat nigga get a chef that cook food and couldn't finish his plate
So at the end of the day, give 'em at least the clip from shots blammin'
I treat the bitch, after the pieces hit, like I'm scammin'
Damn it
Step in this ring with a plan, you don't wanna brawl
Catch a stray, but you could visit the pound if you want it, dog
I'm in Longside, New Jersey, low, gun involved
I read ya town's population, and nigga, who are you gonna call?
'cause Dre, ya town small as shit
And I brought a drum for all 2931 of y'all
I'm gunning for, you know that John bitch like Gotti's girl
I stick him up until his insides settle and top'll twirl
As for your bitch, yeah, miracles happen, he got a girl
And she petite, you threw The Weeknd on, made her body twirl
She started ridin' as soon as it came on, Bobby's World
A lot of niggas is talkin' with no proportion shit
But you even gotta pay a price when you die, you heard of coffins, bitch
It's fuck the world twice, nigga, seems unfortunate
But if I'm such a dick, hop off of it
Morning, bitch
One round down
Woosah
You might also like[Round 1: Dre Dennis]
This nigga was too quick to snatch a rack
They wouldn't even let this nigga on Smack
Why y'all let him back to battle rap
You might've started the PG Step, but bitch I made it great
Anyone that mentions the shit, they be sayin' Dre
URL was like making facial changes on a created player, they help you save ya face
They was tryin' to protect the kid from the Step like a baby gate
My gorillas get ugly in the hood, these is Bathing Apes
Fat nigga, I'll bow ya head over food, nigga, say ya grace
Fuck a one on one, me and my gun are the greatest mates
The strap heavy but it help me jump better like ankle weights
I took my time, I ain't rush in (Russian), soldier, I ain't a Soviet
Y'all old niggas playin' past y'all prime, kinda like Kobe is
This won't be a tie, recent battles you haven't shown me shit
I show y'all I could fuck up a vet off Smack worse than worse than Jody did
He wanna enjoy the fruits of his labor because this bitch sweet
Go to his crib to black buried (Blackberry) and we gon' dig deep
Don't need a key, we (kiwi) know you honey do (honeydew), so we'll send heat
And have a pair fire at Prez, like he got impeached (peach)
These niggas with little heart thinking they could ride along
Young guns ain't really workin', but they swear they tommy strong
My mindset like using a public bathroom and shitting there inside the stall
Because I don't wanna leave 'til until everybody gone

[Round 2: Prez Mafia]
Niggas done gave me the short end of the stick, I'm talking loyalty that, y'know loyalty this
I'm keeping shit straight up, this is last straw
And it's funny how, these pussy 'never come out the house' cats finally find somebody else barkin' out of your backdoor
I'm pissed, so for the green, you wouldn't like me when i'm angry, bitch
'Cause I'm my class' Hulk, and if I spazzed off
Even my pants might sag, pause
Nah, you see, that was a hidden bar, for you aren't ready for the rounds I'm wastin', I rapped my ass off
Tryin' to conceal the plug and I don't feel ya love, then I'mma steal on ya bud like piff did
They say he crazy, Prez
[?] obese baby bed, that's a big crib
Tell ya uncle, stay home
I kill a restaurant, better chill, these niggas won't get they babies back
Nah, nigga, this ain't forgiving
Just note that I said barbecue, 'cause the finger lickin'
Tia and Tamera, once I split this image, you'll see the difference
I let a billiona air (billionaire), 'cause you have to pay (toupée), you seen Apprentice?
Donald Trump, I won't murk ya bitch, but if that hoe tell, then we in business
Nigga, I came back regardless of the hate like fuck fake, y'all niggas likin' [?]
Go 'head and act if you want, just don't hate, this momma Jones on a smoke break, the ratchet'll spark
I paused the game to take a piss, that mean I'm back from the start
And these fans
Now the fiends watching him like the back on a shark
I said nah, or did I?
Nigga, that's the question at hand
Nigga, let's address it
It all started-- 'cause-- I wouldn't--
Nigga, dead it
It wasn't to better the plan but I did tarnish my name
And got life lessons from fans
I looked at it as a Mario game
'Cause one shell ain't make me less of a man
Shoutout to Smack
Y'all see a nigga back
Whoever said that Prez (dead Prez) back, demeanor is intact
Let's keep it facts
Y'all niggas think I'mma lose
[?], picture that
Nigga, I'm keepin' it cool
[?] to ya boo, tit for tat
And fuck a [?]
Infrared dot
He gon' see how good a [?]
For tryin' to Cookie the empire
They call us clones
Nigga, I used to fill in my [?]
Shit
I used to have small apartment, Dre, I bought some chrome
Nigga, the shit is so big
When I brought it home, I bought a home
And I suggest you kneel, when I shoot shots, it sting
No
I propose you getting a big box
Right after the leg drop, it ring
No
I propose, you getting bow, can he survive like Dr King
Balcony, survive like Dr King
Nigga, not with me, Woosah
Let's get to that old Prez
Smoke bastard
In the end (Indian), a brother step wrong, and get the strap for nothing
[?] mack
I don't know what's worse
Me taking another nigga' raps, or letting the trap down
You know, like how Joe Jackson did Mr. Rat
Let's take it back
When I first started, they said I'd be flipping tiers
But then I took a verse, and the shit wasn't light
The fans looked at me like lice, but still can't figure out how to wash me
Like how did I get in here (hair)
Shots'll flare
Nah, am I down for that, ff, oxin', yeah
But the box clowns
Prez'll put the stock down, that's my career
All heads
Old heads take several seat, am I down for the rockin' chair
Prepare to fight, think Scary Spice, I'm the wildest here (hair)
Dot or Dre couldn't see me then
Or with a group of yes men, that's lot of yeahs (years)
And tell T-Top, with the porridge (pull rich) I pop a bear (poppa bear)
I'm cleanin' up
Nigga
I'm goin' over the flow, like I missed a spot
Look, listen, watch
I got a itch to put dots over dots, that's chicken pox
All eyes on me, which route did I take for the chicken, pox
I let it spit
Think nemesis, I ain't missin' dot
'cause nemesis is [?]
Whoever got you winnin' is a damn reach, [?]
Tryin' to let lead fly through a van seat
The chopper strapped to my back
How I get to this damn heat?
Help me, bro
Shit look like a back itch I can't reach
[Round 2: Dre Dennis]
I'm from where niggas pull out flags when you tryin' to ball
Watch wherre you step, 'cause they gon' say you offside, so watch your lining, dog
If you in the field, and you see a play, and you don't like the call, don't try to brawl
'cause you can waste your time out for nothing if you challenge wrong
I smell death in the air, I'm a heathen when I'm breathin'
He don't wanna taste the beef like he eatin' with a vegan
If I touch the gun, you gon' hear it, I'mma squeeze it 'cause I'm heated
Smell, taste, touch, hear
I'mma give you the fifth since you gotta see it to believe it!
I run away and let it ring, like a nigga a loc
It's plain (plane) and simple like you sitting in coach
It's a Scandal when I'm liftin' the toast
Prez got a problem, this black bitch'll fix it like Olivia Pope!
You wish to die, it'll get granted
Put the fifty to his mug
Put twenty on his head, and have him movin' up
Like the Jeffersons
We'll kill 'em for a dub
Beat 'em up, and drew, and jack son
And give 'em ten and use a snub
Around five, I'm linkin' up, with some hitters that I trust
And watching ten bullets fly, but I can aim at his head and give him one
'Cause Prez should be used to having his face in the middle of them bucks
I was gonna bend ya man too, regardless I was gon' bust a lead
To keep it a hundred, you still would get the buck if you wasn't Prez
A savage, shit, I'm Cory
I'll give him wings he don't deserve, this Harvey
To get away from the shots, this nigga just hit the floor, see
It remind you of Ezel in the liquor store, see
This bum ain't really slick, but he still gon' get the forty
Don't think I'm reckless, you dyslexic, you quick to read me wrong
Ain't shit funny, I ain't riddlin' (ritalin), I'll make you keep it calm
The thing is drawn, and like a road trip, the other sing along
I'll have you feelin' (fill in) the toast, like you tryin' new sneakers on
If these bitch ride for ya, then these bitch die for ya
With the miller, I'll see see Murda, I'm a master, P, it's shockin' ya
I'll fuck ya little ass up, beat the G shit out of ya
Little nigga, I'm 6'3″, but you three six, Mafia (Three 6 Mafia)
Fucking ya bitch is like the barbershop, 'cause she stay with wild sex
She a freak, she sit in my seat, then bring the tape around next
That bitch throw on a cover, then she pullin' my chair up
She sit on the wood like a kid getting a haircut
I eyeball work, I hate the scale, you can tell by my fitness
If I hear about your work like orientation, I'mma come by and visit
I'll bring the shotty on his block, and aim the snub while he pitching
That's what I mean by sticking my nose in somebody's business
Sell straight coking, no shortcuts, no Dej Loaf-in
You don't never see me play like Greg Oden
Straight potent, I break up the rock (Roc) like Dame, Hova
So I'm pushing keys to my death like Beethoven
Same slogan, it's Loud Boys, niggas knows it's us
When we rollin' up, we already rollin' up
Loud Boys, Jersey
[Round 3: Prez Mafia]
I'm the wildest
Not Rasheed, that just mean, that I been (Ben) a problem
And old heads said aim at his whip, over the brick, I'll hit you and whoever they send to block (cinder block)
There's a lot of stake
For acting tough, as soon as we meet, you getting hit with the metal, I tenderize 'em
Bow Wow
What's Bow Wow's ex bitch, Erica?
Well, wherever he hidin', my men'll find him
Straight heat, ready for war
[?] for sure, clip [?], one round down like a hole in the floor
I'm not gonna dwell
But Boom told me to give you coke and it's raw
Hotel room, I got the green light opening doors
Home invasion, I'm only here to get them digits in and out
I run in the spot, like ""where Dre?"", of course he in the kitchen, piggin' out
Fuck how y'all feel, for talking I put the Smith up in his mouth
Now he Garfield, pussy was just kitten on the couch
Why him, fuck a Woosah, lame, get me upset
This clip got no limit
Soldier bitch, that's Mia X
No
I aim it and watch they man dash (Damon Dash), that's Aaliyah' ex
You don't wanna get plane crashed on like Aaliyah jet
Get his in the throat with a Nintendo controller, 'cause we (Wii) up next
You done all you coulda did, you jerk, but this is really the time for when this bitch get murked
I mean the real definition of 'here is where the shit gets worse'
SIG clap, got a kick back, like he hit me first
And the sad part is you walk around like you some [?] writer
Bow, his family mourning, find his brains in front of a lawn so his dome got hired
That's a Mitchell & Ness Heat jersey, my throwback fire
You ain't seen shit, you waitin' on somebody to tell on a nigga, Boom, you shoulda called out Myers
It's Prez Mafia, I brought the clock for ya
[?] fuckin' scared, I'll pop chrome, I'll give you a knot (not) home, like you wasn't there
Think Dre featuring 2Pac
[?] fuck a flare
I let a cal lift on ya, love ain't in the air (California Love)
Dre, once I clap back at ya lackey, you meeting God, think anymore
I'll pack son out back, we don't need a target
If I catch him in that store, cheesin' calm
Then the heaters spark
I let three froze
But watch cheap clothes, why flee (flea) the market
If Surf can say the chopper's out like Welvin, and he the god
This Nina bonkers, pop bro, whoever uncool (uncle) shot, that's Peter Parker
So suburban
He never been around them niggas that's been them riders
I know low rider Bloods that's givin' out transfusions you mention drama
Or them big locs that hang around with them folks, give a clip, that's karma (comma)
When you see a playboy throwin' up bunnies on ya block with a drum, it ain't a Energizer
Pardon my [?]
You know my partner's a loud boy, he got Tourettes Syndrome
The nigga don't know he be acting stupid, y'all
Like I said I want John John, tell a nigga I'm ready to get a Don knots (donuts) for not knowing when three's company
But when two are involved, you move in, jack and I don't give a fuck who feel that bar
Tell Dougy he shoulda said, I'm still a nigga that keep wheel still (steel) like a boot on the car
It makes sense, honestly, I don't know what to think of this
They got me faced against battle rap's Weird Al Yankovich
A big dummy
I slide the common part of sentence, I showed a pair of these (parodies), the clip funny
City, after you shoot this bag, please have my cash like Mitch Money
What, y'all ain't peep, cousin
Shoot this bag, please have my cash, that's Mitch Money
Peep, cousin
No [?], you eat nothin'
Shots, I'm sendin' em out
Don't say shit, or a clip'll come out
And as a child I was taught not to talk	with a fifth to ya mouth
Dedication and hard work, that's what lyrics about
Like I said, I had to sit and push for this shit to come out
Keep givin' 'em clout
I ain't do this shit for you, this shit for the crowd
For the folks
And sayin' I took some shit
I was battlin' Took and shit
And I took the shit with a smile
For the folks who really loved me and remember my style
Zike a fat bitch on a seesaw, it's about to go down
[?] Hoffa
The only reason why I called him Hoffa is 'cause his friends is some busters, think about it
Look author (Arthur), why convert the bull when I red tops
Count on the head
Shit, if you just don't want it, get slap boxed
'cause I mastered rounds and angles, both behind metal, every word that I write in my pad, locked
And this round is for my niggas that really don't have guap
And since ya mouth brings less fortune, it's gon' have knots (less fortunate, have nots)
WeGoHard, thanks for having me, nigga
And guess what, it's two reunions, FTW, Faculty, nigga

[Round 3: Dre Dennis]
I don't care who feel some type of way, that's where the Grinch stay
You bitch-made!
I'll run up on you, with a switchblade
Ch! Then switch blades!
His head'll be red like Malcolm X in his pimp days
Yeah, I stole it, bitch
'cause you took bars, and act like you wrote the shit
There's one main rule in hip hop, and you broke the shit
Fuck all the excuses, you was lazy and stole
How many nights y'all stay up late and feel like y'all brain will explode
You shoulda used your art and craft and tried making ya own
I know things was rough an' (Ruffin) you shoulda left the Temptations alone
You said, I'm only here to make shit worse
But I break fast, 'cause I'm quick to grab the toast like I'm late for work
But you stole ya homies' bars and had to take his words
So you had another nigga punch for you like you was late for work
You got a black prostitute mindset
'cause nigga, you fuckin' cheap
You'll break your word to leagues
That shows your trust is weak
How you steal deposits to give your soul food just to fuckin' eat
You a take plates without showing ya face like uncle Pete
You break your words as a man when your funds is dropping
You steal bars and deposits, you a bum with problems
Like Paula Patton, I hope you done with robbin' (Robin)
'cause you don't help your team rock, it's a shame
Let me explain
'cause you use the trap wrong like Jesse and James
The trap was in your corner, motherfucker
Bloodsucka
Sad leech shit
He betrays anyone that hugs the bull (Huxtable), this man Heathcliff
They was protecting you, doing mad weak shit
Now you just lost your full court, Prez
'cause you fucked up the trap defense
Yo, we was scheduled to battle last year, right
Got to the event and we heard it was closin'
Since we ain't battle, we ain't get paid
He was stuck in Jersey, just broken-in
So you stayed at my man's crib, and he was servin' you coke-ing
I know all about you snorting all them percs up ya nose in
I saw him before the battle, he had worried emotions
I went to give him daps, and he thought I was Mercy and frozen
You say you power forward, but [?]
Burstin' a forward
My state will make him hurt any moment
Jersey
Comin' outta nowhere like Surf when he choking
Who gave this scary nigga stripes
I think he Beetlejuice
On Smack, you'll call Murda for problems, did it on TV too
But when in Pittsburgh, niggas was gon' jump Murda
I could see the proof he was callin'
You was unreachable
You answered in battles but couldn't when he needed to
Let me speak to you
'cause I made observations
And me and Bonus be having the same conversations
Yo, Bonus
I fronted Prez a quarter for five hundred, but this man's a sucka
So I'mma need that giant Bronco, so fam is covered
We understand each other
See, giant Bronco, was me gettin' that quarter back
Related [?]
Since he lie, he gotta pay ten, see what this man in, brother
You got no heart, so like a bench player, don't start
Chrome spark
Better give interest to them bucks, like a loan shark
You lean on me, I'm firin' the old Faculty like Joe Clark
I smoke ya weed and won't pass gas like farting not cool
Go to his crib and I won't march in like Marvin
Nah bull, I'll be a mechanic, in a car with my tool
Just waiting for you to come out ya spot like the parking lot full
So tell this shallow nigga, don't play in the deep end
I'll wave and drop a player like Dre Den' a GM
While he grieving, I'll get a MAC
And take him to see him
That (mourning) morning over when I put a M (AM) to PM
Your bitch love to show her ass like her jeans was sagging
She a ballhog, I was surprised when I seen her passing
And them cheeks I'm smashing
I can't believe [?]
I had to keep going wild like a Steams reaction
You freak skeezer, she a meat eater
I call her carnivore
Anyone acting rude been stutter, that's what they sorry for
Gun in my jeans, saw it pulling my leg like a charley horse
So the K9 going through a square like a doggy door
I ain't wave my arms all battle, and you ain't see me flex
But it wouldn't be me if I ain't do my PG step
We wash you filthy niggas, so if you drop dirt
My old shooters got chemistry, so crew not Spurs
What I got in store, this count (discount), like my coupon work
I'll move the steel (still) nigga like You Got Served
I'm fat 'cause I'm hungry
You starving, you don't eat
Closed mouths don't get fed, and pussy, you don't speak
Basing a whole battle over size is so weak
'Cause what they call you when you heavy, wait, obeseEmbed"
Black M,A Day in the Life of Denzel Curry Pt. 2,"49 ContributorsA Day in the Life of Denzel Curry Pt. 2 Lyrics[Intro]
I do this for my niggas
I do this for myself
Enter my mind
That's all I can say nigga

[Verse]
Five in the morning turn to six, my life has turned into a bitch
With the fucking wettest clit in the galaxy
Rapidly tripping and rapping and snapping
And killing my niggas that coming through blasting
And looking for money, and looking for magic
We sticking together like metal and magnets
Lutrashious, me and Mercedes up in the condo
On the phone for nine months, we sparked the conversation
Enter the void, mind escaping
Racing, plus my heart rate went blazing
Ganja, as I ponder on graduation
Threats hit a nigga, the points where I could make it
Not a contract, could take what I created
Not on paper, my clan-name erased it
Down nigga, since day one, I never hate shit
Same nigga tat 2-7-5 on the pavement
Got highs and lows on one path of greatness
Eighteen years of life, larger than basic
Markese, Andrew, Darnell, et cetera
It's still my niggas, know things will get better but
Things take time, and all things change
Some people venture off and make they own lane
But the place is just the same from the F.L.A
But my cuzzo Chynaman got hit with the eight from the clip
And my nigga William had his last trip
When he hung his self in his room
Roll up the spliff as I puff one, puff two for my niggas
Then three for the niggas that be hating
Nigga, I don't care, Aquarius Killa, the Mack
Talk your girl up out her underwear
Let me bite that pussy like a god damn juicy bear
Suicidal thoughts, I'm on my head to make it clear
Another life and day, hallucinate got me in my rear
Lamborghini dreams, Freddy Krueger is my shooter
Raider still the klan, but C9 is the future, bitch

Switch it up, take her to the back
Like I do with her, splurgin'
Yeah girl I know you're not a virgin
So twerk it
After I work it baby you're worthless
Curses, but my dear I'm just blurring
Roses, just turned a nigga into Moses
Any given reason I open up in the ocean
I'm stroking, playing slow motion
Juvie, who me? All up in her head like a kufi
Ooh wee, Denny Cascade is a cool G
Realest nigga ever I meditate on mount Fuji
With a lady that resembles Lauryn Hill
Welcome to my world, the red and blue pill

Making money day, and night, and afternoon
Went from making music tryna balance school

And I did it under 30, mane (30, mane)

Seeking solitude in the company of others
We're not in love- we just can't resist each other at playtime

Save a ho, S curled in the cape, doggin' these hoes
Nigga raw doggin these hoes, until the bitch say she's late
Bitches on my dick, purple weed like Prince
Better tell these hoes, bitch I ain't Clark Kent
Denny Cascade charge hoes like rent
Bumpin' triple-6 chiefin' while I'm shining moonlit
In a Cadliac, splat, puff on the doja, the thraxx

Makin' sure that y'all don't see a cap and a gown
Too many lil' niggas still runnin' around
Come face to face with the wild and that's the end of your child
Universe, gangsta is the god of the sound
From the planet of the nectar on the sea and the isles
Wanna see an angel dead? Let's walk a few miles
With a sword, halo, and a crown so round
Like root canal, in your mouth
Fuck around you get 40 cal'
Bitch what the fuck is beef to a slaughterhouse?
Got sticks that'll knock your baby momma out
Scratch that, knock Harry Potter out
Hit his head on Obama's couch, nail Obama's scout
Y'all niggas is sauerkraut
When the villain bring the choppers out, then they call you out
Tell me what's that about? When you catch 'em then you ash 'em out
Get the money then I'm cashin' out
Really what is that about? What's that about?

Only shoot once it's a hit, and if you shoot twice it's a miss

We used to love while others used to play
Don't ask me why, but time has passed us by
Some one else moved in from far away

Now we are tall, and Christmas trees are small
And you don't ask the time of day
But you and I, our love will never die
But guess we'll cry come first of May

The apple tree that grew for you and me
I watched the apples falling one by one
And I recall the moment of them all
The day I kissed your cheek and you were mine

Now we are tall, and Christmas trees are small
And you don't ask the time of day
But you and I, our love will never die
But guess we'll cry come first of May

Its like a blaze when I say your name
Because your body is just striking
Enlightening
Like lightning
The storm here, is quiet
I bite it
When hearing the moans and groans as I dip deep
Your knees weak
But don't speak
When my spirit
Is in sync
Along with you
I lust for you like London Jones
If you my ride or die
Would you ride or grip the chrome?
In a Mercedes Benz
With fine clothes we roam
Just like the traveler, no?
Til' we entered inside your home
Its known
That Denzel can give you the mo' better
Adrenaline rush
As I proceed to get you wetter
I bless her
Just like a pastor seeing someone sneezing
Good evening
The way you look just blossoms as the season
Spring
Meaning you're clean, which is next to godliness
Thank the good Lord he blessed the earth with beautiful goddesses
Dropin' it
To the surface, like a fallen angel
The devil has a new dress
My butterflies are painful
Tame you
So that I can pet the pussy cat
Soft and heavy moaning when I hit it from the back
Skies are looking kinda misty as the scene faded black
Both hands on the wheel ain't no such thing as turning back baby

[Verse 2: Denzel Curry]
It's just, you and I
And God watching over
Kissing on my neck and hands going down my shoulder
Closer and closer
You're feeling a little colder
My mind is saying stroke her but I wanna console her
Hold her
Love is in the eye of the beholder
She could be my Sade and I could be her soldier
Told her
Once when we get a little older
Hopefully we'll push a little baby in a stroller
Lower
Is the tone she whispered in my ear
She said ""I love you Denny and I love you near and dear""
Never knew Nasir
But the words were sincere
When I went inside her mind, it was like Revista Leer
I read between the lines
In her eyes I spot a tear
I uttered to her softly, girl you have nothing to fear
I kiss her on the lips
Then she told me to come here
As she climbed to the top
She became my chandelier
Not knowing
Created another life this very moment
The future of my very insistence's got me open
Its potent
Like the smoke, when its in my lungs
Its a fire in the air
With the greeting of the tongues
But none
Will ever come between me and her bond
So leave my sanctuary don't come back and don't respond
This my garden of Eden
But as one this is our temple
My miniature moral is more than just being central

I don't give a fuck, my nigga, I feel like Jiren
Goin' against Goku, who the fuck told you?
Everybody in the whole game tried to mold you
Clay dough, Play-Doh, Curry don't play, though
Say so, lasso, rope the game, asshole
I don't really give a fuck about you, it's cash flow
Cash rules everything around me, C.R.E.A.M.
Guns rule everything around us, beams
Green or the red or the dots to your head
Fuck around with the Curry, better league and leave him dead
Flames all on my body like I'm Charmander
Denzel in a pond like a salamander
Came through and you know I got the right answer
Everything a nigga spit, shit is all cancer
All AIDS, all bar point blades
Niggas don't know about me, they all fake
Tears off the moon, off the mothafuckin' sun
Denzel the unique one, the God son
I may not be Nas or Lil Nas X
But Denzel hit a nigga through the solar plex
I don't really give a fuck, a nigga is the next

2011, my name camе alive
At the same time, I planned my suicide
Literally, I would live lonely inside
On the physical side, all my miracles died
2012, guess that plan ain't go well
Out my shell, still I'm livin' in hell
Yet it was written, from God it was gifted
To give you a story that ain't hard to tell
2013, far from a pre-teen
But it seems that a nigga chased my dream
Making anything that the world has not seen nor heard
Moving words like verbs, curved
2014, when I turned nineteen
Sayin' RIP to my big bro Tree
And my girl TT, when she got gunned down
Now I'm back on road
'Cause I couldn't come 'round to the funeral
Let a whole year pass
Made an EP and the fans got mad
A lotta issues that a young man had
Just two years shy of a high school grad
2016, when the boy got mean
ULT embedded in my genes
'Round the same time I met X and Ski
If the Klan ain't hit, then we just might be
The ones to have it all in our reach
2017, I had no place to sleep
2018, Taboo One Three
Was the best shit people ever heard from me
When you get pure pain, I'ma just make heat
2019, been good and bleak
Cut off the locks, new looks, same me
Used to chase my dreams, now the dreams chase me

South side of Africa, you ain't really heard of her
Mama was a daughter of a chief, make sense since
Royalty so skin deep, melanin carried through heaps
Papa was a soldier, built our whole life off his shoulders
Both were my pillars, yeah, I told ya
Both were a product of about ten kids
About ten needs, about ten feeds
Walking to school, it was about 10k's
Knees getting faded, hope getting faded
Aches, no lights flashing and flicker, it was a dream
Providing for they children, just to hope our souls beam
With prosperity, my parents, they took big care of me
Made sure opinions were heard 'cause it was scary
Middle kid tings, always lurking in the back
When I felt I wasn't heard, decided to take back

In my room
Staring and tripping
Look at the TV its Adult Swim
Dripping the lick from the LSD
Lucid I'm dreaming
On broader perspectives
Chiefing forever
Smoked out with Ciara
Right on 37, the hottest of weathers
November the 4th to November the 6th
On memory lane as my mind reminisce
On my dawgs
Why'd shit have to go the wrong way?
Young breeds falling victim to the fucking gunplay
No MMG, just a RIP's
And the channel 7 news
Popping on the Twitter feed
On the story about the beings
Yellow tape at the scene
Lead bullets to your jaw
Martin Luther King
She was only 18 hit got hit with 13
Be Careful where you go
'Cause niggas is lurking
All night, Poltergeist, Ghost
Tell me who I can't approach
Have all my dawgs drowning inside my head
As I wonder how Rodney King might stay afloat
Coast, dead
Gone off the shroom pack
Joints stay fat, like Joe
Have a squad terror at your door
Pour shit, head in the dead zone

'Cause blacks irrelevant
Better scream fuck the world until it's celibate

Is a nigga based on the skin, not ignorance
Is a bitch, obligated to suck a dick
Maybe not

Eleven shooters caught up inside a weed headshot

Oh no
Bringing out the Glock like Frodo

What I see, clear as Visine
My brother ended up in a crime scene
Cops are the only ones on a crime spree
Cowards took my brother untimely
Tryna get a little face so niggas try me

Up on the Three Two Ave
I wake up every morning tryna figure how to start my day
I go to the bathroom then take me a piss
Brush my teeth now it's time to parlé
I call up B Money to open the crib
So it's time to go jet so I skate (open the door nigga)
I'm rolling and blousing and coughing these ounces
These money roll a whole 28
Took 8 grams
Bumping 99' jams reminiscing on the town last week
Talk about a cop cherry tops run a block
In a baja saying that the youngin' had heat
Spur of the moment
The youngin' was dumb as he died from a fatal attack
On the 207 called 9-11
Hit 15 bullets to his back
Shit got whack
Everybody really on that but you just got to embrace it
Keep it on the churches like it’s braces
Murder Gardens Carol City unsolved cases
Face it, you get wasted like it's GTA
But this ain't no Grove Street and you ain't CJ, nigga

Well it's the A to the jigga jigga G
Rolling with my brother, no other, P-I-C
Partner in crime if you didn't catch the rhyme
Yes, my brother, my man, my fam, the whole nine
And since we're talking about brothers
There's another dog in the pound, (K. Shabazz) is the other
(On this track) Me and Wali World shared time
And go willy way back, black, like Grandpa's hair line
I'm from the ghetto, I will never ever let go
Always had a def show since the get go

Well it's my debut so I gotta stay true
Will he flip or flop?
No I'm a dip to the top
I can never get sick of looking at the brown grits
I take my pain and flip, I came with the head, now I'm hot

Smoke a spliff with Ice if Wu got the .22
And Mama Duke gets nuff respect
Because she kept me in check, one deep, now that's a roughneck

Sell out is what I'll never do, get paid is what I'd better do
And while my brother's in the federal
I'm making LP's, collecting G's for my revenue

Now so I was bombing

Happily ever after

Before you judge, do your research, nigga, we hurt
Before I even think about us, I think of me first

I told the hood that I'ma come back, just get me out first
And niggas quick to call me sellout when I'm on the outskirts
Want to know how I got there? I put in hard work
I know you wanna get this money, you gotta be smart first
Pay attention, write this shit down, and repeat my verse
I don't fuck with people that ain't on the same time
Too lazy to wanna make dimes, then wanna takе mine
When it comes to fucking with dimеs, you need to peep signs
Pussy over money online, then, nigga, you blind
Find yourself paying for shit because she too fine
If you wasn't making a cent, you getting denied

Seen a lot of brothers fucked up, seen some friends die
'Cause you walked away from a fight don't mean that you pie
I don't got a problem with all these other new guys
Even find myself bumping 'bout just a few guys
Doing all this industry shit, I start to realize
We lookin' up to junkies and shit, then mimic they lives
Niggas go and get some new tats, wear the same chains
Gucci, Prada, Fendi, you all wear the same thing
Niggas fucking on the same bitch that you call main
Now I gotta roast you slow, mane, like it was lo mein
If you said I came for your head, I guess I'm Rogaine
All of y'all like layover flights, y'all niggas too plain
You don't need to brag or dress up when all your shit flame
Sabotaging other black men, bruh, all that shit lame
I got love for Megan, but also got love for Noname
And I won't stop speaking to y'all until I change

[Chorus]
The game, the game, the game, the game

These niggas out here screamin' that they gang, gang, gang

Black M,Tally,"16 ContributorsWitness Protection Lyrics[Verse 1: Travis Mendes]
Ayo, bitch, I'm spectacular
Tall black man with an advanced vernacular
Immaculate, slightly crazed over-analyst
Backpacking activist, I'm the new catalyst
To change your mind frames back up to what matters
It's a brand new chapter
I'm adding more paragraphs to this cast
Slack up and get embarrassed
I had it with you wack-ass niggas, I'm changing channels
And I dare a nigga to touch my remote
Might fuck around and start a revolt
Cause we know you can't keep lying to my people
We wreckin' shit wherever we go
I'm free yo, ice cold nigga—eskimo
Goddamn it, I'm the man—30 karats on the hands, homie
Motherfuck your next plans, homie

[Verse 2: Blaque Keyz]
Motherfuck your advance, homie
A motherfucker, I might be your stepdad, homie
I'm home alone with strep
Got sick vocals that flex on any nigga
I'm Bret, the hitman, homie
Heart colder than Owen when I be flowin'
Frozen like any arctic, I start shit like Bart Simps
I blew up here, something like Marge's
I barge in the booth like drill sergeants with troops
I am the proof like a vest made for bullets
When you pull it, just be careful when you shoot
Dex got the footage
My placement belongs inside a spaceship
I'm handin' out facelifts for those who need replacements
A makeshift bow staff for you old bags, I blow past so fast
Swingin' to get your dome smashed, I'm on that
I'm crusing the city holding my mojo
Looking over my shoulder with no GoPros

Ain't know the kid moved dolo
I'mma live forever through these bars, fuck YOLO
I'm a motherfucking superstar, what are y'all on?
We gon' be rich off this shit, word to Mylon
My mama always told me
""Keep calm, enjoy the calm in the morning""
Only reason I don't blast off you cats without warning
And I will not let you ignore me, it's all me
So I'mma keep blazing y'all with more heat
At least it balls up the morphine
Got a line around the corner give me more fiends
And I'mma father all you niggas, word to Maury
Man, I'm the future bitch, fuck who was before me
Goddamn it, I'm the man—30 karats on the hands, homie
Motherfuck your next plans, homie
And motherfuck your advance, homie

[Verse 4: Jon Bellion]
You know the industry's in trouble when you understand
That L.A. Reid is blowing fucking millions on some cover bands
You're all cover bands, all I hear is cover bands
Understand we know that all the compliments are underhand
I'm so Italian in the mattress, there's a hundred grand
I'm not a homosexual, but that is how you fuck the man
Second thoughts before you play me shit you made at camp
And Fruity Loop producers re-evaluate and cut your hands
Mike Krzyzewski, O's and X's, baby, run the plan
The bullies in the lunchroom stole the bread, flung the ham
Knives can break, guns can jam
And death will come for every man
But all I need's my Bible and some melatonin, understand
All we see is happy days, Richie Cunningham
Beautiful Mind drives the people, we do trucks and vans
Good Will's gone hunting, motherfucker
Where you been, Affleck?
We're just seein' if you ducks can dance
I am the black sheep, I'm half 'sleep
You athletes couldn't walk in a track meet
No racism cause you all could take a backseat
Your past seats are ass cheeks
My class meets the stampedes of Nissans and Camrys
My family's a bunch of superheroes, Stan Lee
Damn it, I'm the man—30 karats in the hand
Motherfuck your advance, homie
Twice, motherfuck your advance, homie

And it's your boy Ultimate Denzel Curry
Aye yo, Premo drop that shit

Uh, I want a swag like Fab, crib like Ross
Paper like Jiggy and a hustle like Puff
Keep it street like Jeezy, label like Weezy

Legend like Pac, and that nigga Biggie
Go from ashy to classy just like Nicki
Major key like Khaled, smoke like Snoop
Bang beats like Dre and make movies like Cube
Tour the world like Flo, neck like Slick Rick
With a fire ass album like 50 gon' get rich
Cool like Cab, bang like Jimmy
Smoove like Juelz, and freaky like Zekie

Ayo, I'm bout to hit this beat raw, somebody get a Plan B
I'm so hot I made them move the cypher to Miami
After this your girl mouth about to be dumb like Donald Trump
Cause I'm on this screen spitting harder than Donald Duck
Last year, I was watching this on the TV
This year, hi hater, I know you see me
When I was ducking cops, swiping cards with no I.D
You was home bored, scrolling up on your IG uh
My future bright boy I see no error
I could've been like you, broke without a clue
But those c-notes better
A rap nigga touch me?
He know better
I be solo, but I'm 32 deep
My clip a ladder I make them bullets go climb up your cheeks
It's never about how you fall, it's always about the hand that catches ya
You can catch 3 to your head like you Chance the Rapper
Jay told me never go Eric Benét
I say never go Joe Budden, and lose a bad chick like Tahiry right on TV
Because fuck a rap beef, knowing they wanna meet me
Rappers, dancing like they Meechie
Louie shorts on jet skis, ooh I'm finna [?]
But I'll put some things on a yacht though
Never lose your cool over some thot hoe
.40 cal leave you with abajo
Yellow colored lambo, looking like it's a nacho
5 hour flight for your chick, to eat some tacos
This too easy I ain't have to go hard
Ima hold it down for Dade County and pass it to my dog
[Verse 3: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
This disgusting, like I just spilled some mustard
I'll turn my flow to arson, let it burn like it's straight from Usher
Matter fact, I rode here on the back
Of a saber tooth white wild mountain cat
Double park in a spot for the handicap
'Cause if you can't tell I got a bad back
But, it's a mayday, who gave this crazy a payday
And when she see my big huevos
Made face like she stepped on Legos
God of War, like I'm Kratos, carnivore, I'm the prey though
I'm a whore, we a whore, we all whores, ayy!
Even if she hot I'm gonna drop her like potato
Told these niggas catch up like the sauce from a tomato
I see myself in Great White, you shrimp just like alfredo
And the way that I'm getting bread like I'm a jar of mayo

[Verse 4: Denzel Curry]
Better recognize, this the man ULT
Coming from the depths of that black land CC
Aquarius'killa the ultimate no Marvel or DC
You'll never be superman cuz I'm where the green be
Kryptonite
You say we blood until they lay you in the crypt tonight
Be careful or people that's around that ain't living right the
Left turn leave another brother chest burn
Bullets so hot they'll leave your homie's chest hair permed
Used to be on the block like H&R
Where the crackers chasing most of my niggas like an Atar
Raw, I'm Egyptian, nah I'm encryption, law
My depiction is a real nigga description bitch
You still hum capped off a niggas rims
Put some green on your head like I play The Sims
Say green because I've never been a flashy nigga

Bottle water when I rap, grew up never drinkin' from the tap
I was so sick of these airports 'til COVID hit the map
Now we're too sleep at this point, we even tired of takin' naps
I lost close friends to a drug binge, in hopes I can bring 'em back
Momma said this the revelation, doubters all lookin' for resolutions
Everyone buying in desperation
On a good note, there's no air pollution
Man, our reflection is over the seven seas
It's clear that we want it all, eyes on we, what you see?

How many niggas is saying they pimping
It's evident when is it none of you niggas got pimp in your blood
All of y'all watered down like a tub full of suds
I cannot fuck with you let me roll up my bud
Girl you look like a dime but can you roll up a dub
Go to the club you said you ain't looking for love
But you dark and lovely and the night was gusting
Marijuana and bubbly now your body I'm lusting
Forever, ever never for the time being
You without clothes is the only thing I'm seeing
Hair swanging you hear what I'm saying
I may be a gook but this time I'm not playing
This conversation was start of creation
Creating a game that was shown to me
Niggas be praising you hoping to play with you
Sorry my dear you're just shone to me

[Chorus: Denzel Curry]
Well it's cool to us if you want to be shown
We'll just blame it on the fact that she just don't know

From the land, which is the city of Babylon
Dreads in my hairs, don’t confuse me for Cinnamon
I'm one of a kind, as I grow like a Digimon
When I'm evolving, not many books
Many revolvers, no problem solving
Illegal tendencies, infinite symphonies
Illustrate misery, living on infamy
Infamous Lord
If you come back from the dead, you will go back to the morgue
I'll hunt you like Sun Tzu, so better be humble
Don't make me, I'm Wesley in the Art of War

Well, I'm going back to fantasy land
I'll have nothing to take with me, I can't just defend my-

[Verse]
On the west side screaming, ""Thug life""
Like I ran off on the plug twice
Ain't no lies, I ain't like Plies
Fuckin' mad hoes, might be my vice
She my type, but she unknown
Not bright, but she know I'm on, man
She said she want all of me
That pussy keep callin' me
She’s gon’ throw that ass back just like a shoe that's thrown by Cardi B
These niggas got no game, they on JV, and I'm on varsity
Pass, pick up, smash, ash, stash, switch up
Glad bag, mad thicker, gag gag gag, pick her
If she ever wanna 69, she a cancer
If she only with you for the money, she a scammer
She can be a freaky bitch and put it on a camera
Wave around the pussy like a motherfuckin' banner
Flag on the play, ooh
Turn my swagger on today, ooh
New ZXLTRON on the way
Catch your bae comin' over, andele
But I never let her stay unless she into anime, yeah
You might also like[Outro]
I would sing on the outro but I- I honestly don't know what to sing about
I really don't know what to sing about
Freebase asked me to do that shit and I fuck with freebase, so4Embed"
Black M,COLE PIMP,"19 ContributorsThieves Lyrics[Verse 1: NORMAN ATOMIC]
I'm the colonel of the motherfucking tank
Got a mattress, no need for a bank
Yeah, I see you motherfucker, but my stare is fuckin' blank
Last night three motherfuckers thought that they were gettin' paid
Tried to rob me blind, so I cut open their eyes
Left their blood on my blade
Now I'm sippin' lemonade in the shade
Just another day in the 7th Ward by the lake
Yeah, bitch, where I stay
I e- I be ridin' in that camo Jeep, double cup is ocean deep
I'm sleepin', don't you make a peep
Y'all a bunch of fuckin' cheapened sheep
I'll fuckin' cut and gut your fuckin' seepin' slut
And I'm a fuckin' mutt, I'll sell your meat for bucks

[Verse 2: ANTHONY MARS]
Got a bitch that will get your ass done up
Hot in the winter and cold in the summer
Pussies wanna try to come and run up
Glock cocked and I'm chillin' with my gun up
See I, never gave a fuck about nothing
Got crack in the stove, hide the money in the oven
If I'm ever tryna get my funds up
Break in with the mask, grab the money real fast
I hope a fucker know when they see me
Never in my life ever sold a CD
Lo-fi pimp, mp3, black and white life, no TV
Smokin' that dope on the low, got all them pounds in the flo'
Drugs never slow 'cause this that junkie who can flow
It ain't, nothing to rob me a liquor sto'
Syrup, I'm drinking it by the fo'
The devil be all up in my soul, bitch

So hard to ghost, yet, I'm ready to die
Not B.I.G., not limited to the sky
If the doves cry, they label me as a Prince
With a bad bitch that’s covered in cheetah print, oh shit
Wanted for the most swag, I'm the culprit
Draped in unknown shit, you ain't own this
Shoe game just like the Home Alone flicks
These ain’t Off-White, these McCaulay Culkins, ooh
I'm the token Black guy, that's right
Tell the whole world kiss my backside
Watch your girl spread like wildfire
Easy as pie, who let the fat guy loose?
Back to black roots
Back to stack racks and pack them black coupes
Attack we contract to back and black suits
I am what I am, I'm Zeus and Jésus, what it do?
I ride with the livest men, day ones from five to ten
From the 3 like Iverson
So that means I only ride with Ken
Like I hit you with the Hadouken
Fuck a ""How you been?"" or ""Where you been at?""
Go ask your girl where her chin at, go ask the world what I win at
Same place that we pray to God where we sin at
Lookin' for the holy water, ask me where the Gin at?
Woah, let's slow down
King Arthur of the table, let's go 'round
Never try to tell me what’s my sound
And ""CLOUT COBAIN"" made me really hate clowns
So profound when it come to the art
I was too bound to the ways of the dark
Let ’em all drown with a ticket for the Ark
Tryna ride this wave, be a victim to a shark

First off, every rapper in the game garbage
No flodgin', bitch I'm the Green Goblin
Bitch I'm always working hard, but I ain't Amish
All you silly little niggas need to pay homage
To a nigga like me, 'cause you ain't like me
And most likely, I'ma take your bitch
In some brand new Nikes, used to rock the Y-3
If you sponsored by me, then you are the shit
Big time player, big city roller
Came a long way from using Motorola
Pickled eggs, don't forget the juice, that cost a quarter
Tryna dodge the crackers when they try to reach their quota
Yeah, you already know what it is bitch
I light up an incense, 'cause nigga, I'm too lit
Don't give me your two cents, here's a penny for your thoughts
Put a penny in a pig, never pennies for a thot
Know what it is, know what it ain't, I'ma go back to the bank
Fuck a new car, in a new paint, I'ma pull up in a tank
Like drank never on me, and the dank never on me
If a nigga catch a fade
Then we paint with the homies like a mural
Fuck a federal bureau
It's plural, hella hoes and apparel
That's American, none of these hoes I'm marryin'
They only give a fuck 'bout what a nigga carryin'
Hmm, ha, I'm the new guy
Nigga better not try me, he might die
If a, nigga, pull up, I
Just might, have to, pull out, fire

Once this advance hit, take a 30 grand hit
Bank account damaged, I'mma get some jewels
Ain't no sense in savin', rent to be paid in
But ain't no way to sense it once you end up gettin' screwed
Thinkin' you the one, you gon' end up done
When that Grim Reaper come, could be chillin' by the pool
Ain't nowhere to run, man, the sun comin' up, and
You ain't gonna be around to see it when it's full

[Verse 1: Wiki]
Death don't got no mercy, got you talkin' murky
When you poppin' Perkies, she pop her pussy
She drop her tushy, she almost hurt me
Let me get this nut off before the opps could murk me
Could be cops or surgery
Could be disease, could be bitchin', itchin'
Could be fuckin' fleas, my decision, Spanish cheese
Spread it, get it back, snap, cheddar Jack, pat
I'ma get 'em right back, bitch
Meet me on the other side
My only regret is that my mother cried
And my chick too, I shit you
Not, there will be another kid to take my spot
Is it too early for me? Will there be a jury for me?
Have you heard me Lordy? Worried you ain't heard my story
Will it be late at night or in the early morning?
Either way, slurpin' forties out in purgatory

Ashamed of myself, the pain that I felt
My paper, my wealth, not concerned with or pertained to my health
Not concerned with if I hang from a belt
All these people talkin', I just stay to myself, so what's real?
Watch me float around my city, gettin' wild
With a stomach full of bile, as I suffer with a smile
Think about it when I wake up, money all got ate up at the bar
Prolly get some new tomorrow, I be paid up, straight up
Floatin' down the River Styx, countin' daffodils
Ignorin' all these e-mails from Complex and Mass Appeal
Thinkin', ""If I wasn't such a pussy, I'd have had a deal""
When I die, play my failure on the blooper reel

Jackin' people for their beanstalks, stackin' my green up
As I keep my head to the sky, as if I seen up
See the blood, mix it with the Sprite inside of my lean cup
It's a dual reality of sobriety, as I fiend up
Voices, scrolling' through every option, their choices
Pointless, nine millimeter might leave me voiceless
Appointed to a therapist when I'm very pissed, I'm arrogant
Tellin' myself that I be fine, it's the point where it's scary, yes
Carried this burden, for certain, I just need a surgeon
To take away all my emotions, my system is nervous
You only think deep when a fuckin' shrink speaks
Only time I count sheep is when a nigga six feet
Six deep, ten toes, nah, that's sixty-fours

[Verse: Denzel Curry]
Outside, looking in
Reached me on a place you've never been
See, I have the power of many men
When I walk, you don't see a grin
It's my ignorance with intelligence
Militant move, you should never question the elephant
I appear, yet I'm barely even here
When you're not around, there’s no one that's allowed to see my tears
Adam to your Eve, apple of your eye
Whatever the circumstances, know I'll end up on your side
Carole, hit you with the lovestruck arrow
Feelings start to scat like Ella Fitzgerald
Pharaoh, honestly, I meant to say pheromone
You was always there since my parents was never home
Orphan, cracked fortune
Protecting my precious orchid from evil forces
Dormant, see the sky's not stormless
Monday is so heavy
Hit you back on a Tuesday, when things feel steady
Here's the prophet, the one and only who's laying there
Forever known as E, ain't no need for the alias
I'm representing Mars till I feel like an alien
And you're the only star that I'll date again, love

Days without your face
It's hard to stay sane alone
I hate the time you're not here

Black M,G’Z UP,"3 ContributorsAll In The Family Lyrics[Intro: The D.O.C.]
I had nigga run up on me tell me one time man
Y'all niggas from the south is so laid back wit ya'll shit
You know he was tryna interpretate
You know how we do our thang
You know how y'all make that shit happen
I said look at this here
We just wanna live between the sky [?] the dirty away ya understand me?
That's the real deal all the freedom talkin' 'bout this DFW shit
This gorilla shit, [?] shit
Yo dog let'em know what your business is

[Verse 1: El Dorado]
Heroin, weed, speed, the yay, I want the power by any means
Several creams like Frito Lay
It pays to spread your hustle a lil' bundle won't hurt
Find you shoe
Put your foot in now put in work
Dolla dolla motherfucker is what I holla when I scuffle
This my block and attack then I box you wit my knuckle
Do you buck, cheddar chicken
Motherfuckers about my swip
I gotta pocket full of a stone and that's on the gorilla
I told ya money over hoes 'til the floor we up
These sluts don't give a fuck so I don't give a fuck
They good from bustin' nuts, but they ain't shieet
A bitch is still a bitch, so if you poor or rich
I went from pennies to the millennium, Benjamins give me them
I chased the big face, I'm tired of my wages minimal
This better be my time or result to crime pay
I gots to have dealer can't live without ya big face

All in the family, she yo freak my freak, let's keep it in the family
Dollar bill y'all, all in the family, all in the family
All in the family, she yo freak my freak, let's keep it in the family
Dollar bill y'all, all in the family, all in the family

[Verse 2: El Dorado]
Still do nuttin move but the money
Steady comin' for me, motherfuckers lookin' bummy
Can I have another hit, ain't that a bitch
Can you get a dime for 5, I got my nigga out six
Along way from rich, I'm blitzed, bout to hit a ditch
In my 80 joboritz, I miss
They ain't even with a Dayton, pump a kick
The bumps rollin' with my blunt, smokin' clunks
Punk bitch I'm throwin' g'z up
That's when they freeze up
Lookin' like hoes in front of they skeezer
Saint Jean you seen with a twist of lime then take the bam bam to your mind
Baby one more time, then ride like Ginuwine
Foot the gas sucka ass so I took off where I put the trash
Then match, money over 304
Mo' more over 304, but y'all don't hear me though

[Hook: El Dorado]
All in the family, she yo freak, my freak, let's keep it in the family
Dollar bill y'all, all in the family, all in the family
[Verse 3: El Dorado]
Still do nuttin move but the money
The greens, I want every penny, by any means
Sup, what's happenin'
Cream, tax free, proud to g
Our money earnin', so I'm burnin' currency
All in the family, let's keep it
You don't wanna shit start
My click G the deepest
Gorillaz and killaz
Fuck these hoes
Why she all up under me like Vogue, I suppose
It's the gorilla lifestyle, that I live
All in the family, for real, I'm in it like a splinter
Continue with the mashin'
Automatic fully when I pull it catch a big bullet fragment
Assassin don't make me get obituary
Our brand dash new
I'm a professional killer it's necessary
To dust and bust out
Just clouds of smoke
They said I did it black mafia style out the funk
They know, with no evidence no fingerprints no clue
Did I stutter man?
That's on the butter man
Dolla bill y'all all in the family
Get yo skreel toe y'all all in the family

[Outro: The D.O.C.]
Yeah that's what the fuck I'm talkin' about (yeah you are)
Yes sir, and we gonna do it like that
From now on understand me
Y'all do my deu--, 60 deuce of tight Cadillacsaville feel the mack
D.O.C
And only these motherfuckin' big faces, that's the family
Bitch ahahahEmbed"

Yeah, ayy, LoRd Lu C N
There's time's way back, man
When we used to smoke kush and just chill, man
In the Cadillac Seville, man
Just thinkin' about the cosmos, man
You know astrology is where the knowledge be, you know?

[Verse 1: Denzel Curry]
Ayy, my 8-track stay slap
Way before I had a Cadillac with hub caps
Way before a nigga ever rocked a wave cap
Way before a nigga ever had to stay strapped
'Cause these niggas still tripping, Cadillac's dipping
Still pistol gripping, foes still tip in
Got hoes in the hotel just like the Tipton
Making money off of square niggas that's attempting
To get in the box but they watching out for cops
""Yo I hear the sirens, shh, stop!""
Whoa, still, my 8-track still slaps
Runnin' through the city like a goddamn Mac
Kaleidoscope colors in a brand new 'Lac
My goons in the back do not wear all black
They wear white suits, it's time for me to shoot
It's time that I get my bullets in time to recoup
Regroup, I go back to the club with my troops
With a bad bitch that's on my side lookin' like Hoopz
Who, I'm in the club, who, rollin' a dub, who?
Who got the flavor lookin' like flavor of love, who?
Who got the model? Who, who got the bottle? Who?
Who got the truth that's looking and willing to follow, who?
It's Zeltron the hell spawn, you know this, uh
It seems that I'm flying like lotus, uh
I'm fly like a bird catching locusts, uh
My 8-track stays on Black Moses, yeah

Way before a nigga ever let the guns...
Way before, way before, way before wavy
Way before '84, '94 baby
Way before many more you were born maybe
Way before, way before O.J was crazy
Driving Miss Daisy but I'm driving the Cadillac
Two girls in the lac, hair braided to the back
Sipping on some Similac, telling me to just relax
One is kissing on my neck, the others on my nutsack
She hide the dick, so where my nuts at?
So deep inside, like where her guts at?
Like Obi-Wan I had to cut that
I bust my nut and then I cut back
Drop them off, now it's back to the mission
Let me show you how we do it, High Definition
Let the money talk, what the quarter said
Chilling in my water bed
Thinking 'bout the money, how to make the bread
For instance, a lucrative business
These niggas took the spot now I'm back with a vengeance
Then I pay off the cops, putting stacks in they pension
Look at the newspaper it's not even worth mentioning
The tabloid, I'm back boy
The 8-track slaps in my lac boy

Black M,SET IT,"2 ContributorsString the Bow of Sorrow LyricsSTRING THE BOW OF SORROW

A vessel filled with flowers burning in the bay
The giver of life claimed by death so fast
String the bow of sorrow for a salute
Arrows of eternity, of all the ones I loved

So many departures, so many women gone
I swim the sea of tears, covered with salt
Now I know what it feels like to lose protection
Your body is gone, it left me in a hearse

It may sound cynical, but this life is mine
Life is for the living, that is undeniable
When your image is gonе, my face will be blue
Through timе and space, womanity be one

You're no more in the phonebook
The statements have been written
Goodbye, Norwegian mother
The quiver of time is empty

You liked AC/DCs « Hell's Bells », but Slayer was no stayer :
I know how much you hated that Slaytanic Wehrmacht patch
In the end, you did set it onto my black denim jacket
I picture your afterlife in Freya's wooden halls
Robed in light colours as an Art Nouveau lady
You go for walks in the forest of oaks
Where bumblebees hum and blackbirds sing
Maybe you paint watercolour like you used to
Enjoy cake and champagne and immortal youth
I will leave you here, where you sat with your parents
On the simple wooden staircase
Where bumblebees hum and blackbirds sing
As the evening breeze sways the firs in the sunset

Money and power
Rolling and blowing the sour
I could see you as a coward
You get devoured
This is a lyrical shower
Watch me release all this power
Just counting the hour to come
Where the real will be praised
And the child will be able to raise
No fail, this story of polices inflicting they rage
Trying to put us in a grave
Back up nigga make space
Let the tec burn
Couldn't even save face
ULT coming fucking up the place
TRNE, we the new generation
Patience the key but a nigga won't shake
So it come down to it then I'm coming at your neck
Keep a grip on respect
Everybody show love
All I know is trill niggas, you don't really want war

[Verse 2: Nell]
Back up now it's time to wreck
This TEC get right in his chest
Town hall got me all upset
'Cause they turned in and then go double check
These niggas don't pose a threat
Put them in that cobra stretch
I be got them close to death
From fucking with the ultimate
I guess this how we 'posed to get
I'm about to expose some shit
These boys don't be real so now I watch who I be smoking with
It's best you watch your mouth and pay attention to how close you get
Is they really feeling me?
If they is, it's silly me
Jesus walks within the sea
But most people be scared to bleed
Like curse release some sacred need
Pain and grief remain in reach
Doubt you'll be restraining me
Give you what you came to see
No matter who you be's

Lately I've been trafficking the H
Trap spiked up like Sonic
Got a couple chickens in the safe
Got 'em waiting for whoever say they want it
Spend the bread and pull up in the Wraith
Kill a hooker, pussy leave her stomach haunted
Get yo' ass the fuck up out my face
Your sloppy coochie wasn't worth the couple hundred
I've been fucking bitches each and every day
I might as well, 'cause I ain't stuck in jail gunnin'
And I'm indifferent to these bitches throwing shade
And in their face, I'm there to keep on throwing money
Dirty thumper on my mother fuckin' waist
I got the tip for when the bitch get bloody
I got 'em messing up, I'm all up in her brain
Plus every other bitch in there they wanna suck me
Now they plotting on me, bopping on me, opping on me, I'm the one that got you homie
Not the phony, out to Coney Island styling, wiling, kicking doors, and robbing
Not a problem, bought the carbon, beg your pardon, there's a party, fled authority
Foreign forgies, whores and orgies, all them gorgeous, Bentleys, Porsches

[Verse 4: Rell]
Shell toes and Timberlands to the cement
Ten toes on the gravel, grinding for a reason
Pulling out the region
I'm an archangel not a demon
See the narcs tweaking, heavy fiending
Ten hoes want a bottle, fuck 'em on a balcony, I'm rolling green in
Pop that pussy, leave it leaking
Now I pop a nigga, is he breathing?
You a phono Chapo, faking what you preaching?
You should get an Oscar acting like a bitch
Ye'en hanging with the clique
And it bust, we ultimate
Got a temper tantrum with the fits
You is not a shooter if you miss
These niggas leeching, fleas and ticks
Bitch, I'm not a blood donor
Run the heat and lick that marijuana
Follow me to live another summer
I need to get it all

Plugging that new state of mind
Niggas bugging in the flies

Break, dive in the flow
Intervessel when I drive in a soul
Imma have a ball with the glow
Kids next door, jits, stick it to the cold, wet
I keep that fuck shit to a minimum
Government ain't shit, never giving up
Six feet deep in a beat
When I'm digging up
Now you sleep, on the head, of the indica, smoke
Invasive with the parasite bite, light
Cause you wanna know what's in sight, foe
Dark as the evil, the evil
I do not change but I evolve
Bitch, Imma drop a napalm, bomb
Said that I'll ring the alarm, gun
Water elemental law, cost
Found it and let it get lost
Bitch, common sense, comments could miss
Treason and treachery, left in a trench, trench
Aborting into an abyss
Perpetrators rest and piss in a ditch
Pit, falling forever whenever you fuck with the emperor's ship
They might sweet talk your face to a chocolate chip

Ronny J, listen up
It's WarBucks, bitches

[Verse 1: Pouya]
Call my homie up, pick him up in the pickup truck
Four in the mornin', on top of that it started stormin'
And we had a ho in the trunk, she drunk as fuck
Don't even know if she breathin'
But, really, I don't give a fuck 'cause I already fucked
Passed her to my homie, took advantage of her body
'Cause she nothing but a slut (Yuh)
Started trappin' so we drove a little faster
No concern about the po-po, four more blocks
Then we dare run the red lights, in a dead night
Not a car in sight, think I might do the whole dash
Red and blue light but I skid on his ass (Yuh)
Hands in the purse and I took all her cash
She won't even know 'cause she so fuckin' bad
Then I made a right turn on the street
As we creep, take a peep through the window
And I see that this car was followin' me
But I guess it's in my mind, felt a chill down my spine
As the time rewinds
We stop on the block, unlock the door, everybody hop out

Told the ho, ""Get out"" 'til I see that mothafucka
Dressed in all-black ski mask, choppa hangin' out
The mothafuckin' window all-black vento
The fear read his eyes that told me he was simple
He pointed to shoot the choppa
But lethally, I tried to stop him from gettin' hit by the bullets
My body shot up like a blocka
Three shots pressed through my back, my first shot was a choppa
So I did but that nigga with a choppa, yeah, he slipped
Now this coward is up in my face
African-American, unfortunately, it had to be the race
Looked him in his eyes and told him to pull the trigger
That nigga didn't say shit, goddamn that fool figured
Go 'head and shoot me, nigga, my nigga, I ain't shit
And you havin' second thoughts, my nigga, you ain't shit
If you gon' take my life, then go 'head and pull the trigger
But you not a cold killer, you a lost-ass nigga

[Verse 3: Denzel Curry]
Ski mask resembles the fables of Edgar Allan
But a nigga still poor, my piece is still
But the still of the peace means WarBucks for the love of dinero
Robber, when you face the heat, civilized travel is proper
Getaway clean but half you sleepin' with Oscar
That's a Shark Tale, what do I smell?
Blood, but not Piru
Radio plays the deadliest haikus
When I rest and I stumble to the cars dead piss point
Said a needle and a knife and a tech
One to your eye and one to your chest
Might as well blow your heart to your neck, so
Can you see, world? I'ma leave a nigga wet
Can you see, world? I'ma leave a nigga wet
Now my name is Leroy, Steves about to get my decoy
That's IndigoB in the back of the pickup
Sticks on deck so why not pick the chick up?
Talkin' 'bout the niggas hittin' licks, don't get up
Don't give a fuck so, nigga, it's a stickup
Yeah, nigga, it's a stick-up
Yeah, nigga, it's a stick-up

He's like a drug addict
He can barely function without pills or being drunk off his ass
I don't really like Jordy that much
He acts like some nice guy but when you really get to know him
He's kinda a piece of shi-

[Verse 1]
Bulletproof the black truck moving hella militant
Some white people hate me cause I can't stop all my nigga shit
Wake up count my money smoke a cig and then go beat my dick
I overdosed on pain and this is simply how I deal with it
Taking off her bra I arched my back and then I nut inside
She saw Imma dog
Well let's go take me to get euthanized
My dad hit it raw I didn't wanna live this fucking life
Upside down my cross now all my demons getting utilized

[Chorus]
She say that she love me but I know that she don't
And I only think about her when I'm high or alone
Please don't tell me that you miss me I won't answer my phone
Please don't tell me that you miss me I won't answer my phone

Tell her that I love her but she know that I don't
And I only think about her when I'm high or alone

Black M,HIT THE FLOOR,"32 ContributorsFor the Low Lyrics[Hook: Lil Bibby]
I got snow, I got dro
Everything for the low
I be posted by that store, everything must go
Everything must go, every fiend must know
I got three for the ten, give em one for the four
Let them know, I got coke, everything for the low
What you need? call bro, gotta go back to the store
Every fiend must know, everything must go
Give em three for the ten, maybe one for the four

[Verse 1: Lil Bibby]
Everything for the low, bet they thinking I don't make much
A few days the work gone, y'all boys take months
I save up, I don't take fronts, no rotation we face blunts
Posted up, got killers with me and I dare a nigga to say something
They like ""Bibby you intelligent, coulda' been a president""
I'd rather be a dope boy, I really love selling shit
My last batch was fucked up, I think I need some better shit
Ain't nothing but cocaine and choppers at my residence
Swear my manners on one track, you ain't talking money it's irrelevant
And I only fuck with about two niggas cuz you niggas be telling shit
If the block hot I don't come around, snitch niggas get dumped down
Let the forty cal go baw! baw! about thirty more of them gun sounds

[Hook]
I got snow, I got dro

2055, behold when ye are into the city
There shall a man meet you bearing a pitcher of water
Follow him into the house where he has enter you
I walk alone
I welcome you

[Verse: Denzel Curry]
Flirting with death seems like the biggest infidelity
Darker the skin on the ebony, in Liberty City the weaponry
Has taken out one of my niggas Tiara Grant was the name
Fo' shot up in the corridors, ended up slain
Up in the C9 live in this region, LSD in the cube
Multiply it to the third power, now it's changing my view
Black and white world stinks, that Pepé Le Pew
Should I ask God himself ""What's this opposite you?""
If Lucifer out there, are you after me too
And if I'm not allowed into heaven, would you rapture my crew?
Snooze, catching Z's look forgot to cop a plea
But as far as god goes, I would say god is deceased
Wait, I would say god is in me
Jealously turns into murder cause some pride is vanity
Ego 'come Yeezy, therefore insanity
Catch my thoughts into the seas, let them swim with manatees
2055, mine is finally out the freezer
Welcome back as King Diamond with a new gat that's green
Fresh out the institution that arrived at the zone three
But I chose a different terminal in the eyes of the merciful
Who murder fools, who get trapped inside a maze
Now something is unusual, like Keanu Reeves cubicle
A Matrix, invasion until I'm rapping whole and take tricks
Forsaken with these lead bullets she laced with
Was taken from existence left with Jason
The future I look upon with amazement
Is just a trick with a facelift, Pissing on these peons as a hate gift
I'm shroomed out

The matter is grey, not simply black or white
Left or right, the true path is opaque and vicious?
The future is embued with golden anticipation
Faith-like time never moving in a straight line
The arc of destiny stretching out like a rainbow through the cosmos
40 years can pass by in the blink of an eye
Did I truly live life, or simply ride the sands as they tumbled through the hourglass?
Holding on to the fine moments is like grasping water
Always there, yet always slipping away
Lusting for more than we need
Leading to the greed of acquisition
And the gluttony of position
A future that feels far but all too close
One that could be sublime if we didn't fall behind in the times from our refinement of the mind
The state of my people is altered, but my faith is completely unfaltered

Tell me all of your true feelings
And what you wanna do with us
My crew made of true villains
If we shoot you should shoot with us
If you do that's my nigga
I got love for the real bitches. Now
That there is the truth isn't, it
What else would you consider?

[Verse 1: Mike G]
For those that have seen me in person, know i flow perfect
With out a purpose life must be worthless
In any instance I'm with it forgive for forgetting
Tickets for a sentence they might end up missing
Im hurting
Those with no focus your mind must be open
Thats what i need most
And although others may speak on things that they probably don't know I just need you to go where your knowledge may grow just follow
The voice of a generation: a giant
Due to my level of elevation
Hired Hitman should be my new occupation
And it's this land I rule without competition, see
Nothing is gained if you never take risks
I plan to progress till we don't exist
I need you to listen, i dont need assistance
Just walk with a vision pursue with persistence
So would you go, let em know
Im the man now, stand down
Cause this might be your final chance last dance
[Victory] lap when i pass
Wave the checkered flag in the winner's circle with my Superman stance
Its a mean to an ends [if it's no growth]
And its sink or swim if you dont float
I'm wondering if I'm living a dream
So I'm knowing that I'd lose sleep before I'd lose steam or there's no hope

Get money for the kids when the day comes
Respect me the feelings is mutual
Been doing some things I really ain't used to

Let me talk to them niggas even though its gone hurt
Just watch as I bet, them niggas gone fall off over time like Ace bezel on T.V
So ya life a movie ? Come on fuck nigga boy you not a emcee, and you never keep it g
And ya girl say she want me to stick

While you in the crib waiting on her ass go figure
She ain't never coming back Ol Huell Ass nigga
I'm typically physically scaring you mentally
Pull out the stick and put you out your misery
Wrote this in braille so I know that you feeling me
Niggas are hoes and don't know they identity
In 6 months got on MTV
Now she blow a nigga up like TNT
No pie niggas in my circumference, so you can march boy cause you too weak
Cause I did this shit with no co-sign
Me and Marc met back in 09
Ganged up around last year
Did it independent, yea the whole time
So ya'll can't tell me shit
Nah nigga fuck that ya'll suck my dick
Middle finger to the Radio, Labels, and Media blogs who dont even want to post a nigga shit

Slidin' out 32, pistol regurgin' you
Taking lives faster than bops that keep hurting you
I am not urging you, serve what I'm servin' to keep my mind straight and my plate full of holy food
Shots to your head like I'm Holyfield
Pistol beside me, my holy shield
All of this smoke keep me growing ill
Ho, I don't give a fuck, cause I cannot feel
After the shit that I've been through
Demons deprivin' my mental
Kill them like candidates that could have done the thing
But they done done nothing for you
I murk you gladly juug for your packs again, smoke em until my face sore too
Another galaxy, I am a magistrate we love our guns and our hoes too
Motherfucker, I don't know you
Motherfucker, you don't know me
Mike Dece I have been running in houses and robbin' since I was like fifteen
Hittin' licks with the AR-15s and I'm killin' so clean that it's crispy
Still C$PG till the CC, and I am still the block man, do you see me?
This is the place I'm residing and it will be the place that I'm dying
I pray that you faggots will try me and I will leave this whole fuckin' club slimy
I don't have no time for decidin', I only break bread with my family
Always keep my pistol beside me, you are not fuckin' with my fuckin' family!

Gunsmoke, gunsmoke
Gunsmoke, gunsmoke
Gunsmoke, gunsmoke
Gunsmoke, gunsmoke
They don't wanna see us go
They don't wanna see us, grow
Stepping down on the edge
Stepping out on the ledge
They don't wanna see us there
They just wanna see us here

[Verse 1: Denzel Curry & Nell]
Call crazy comrade, catch us on the cover
Couldn't catch a anaconda, accumaliting the karma
Full off black missed a medal get fellon till I collapse cause I can't change the fact, so in fact I reenact
Read it back, reading in braille
Can Ray Charles see what he feel
I'm gassed up when I'm out of my chill
So he bringing them hell, I'm fresh out of jail
It's time to prevail gotta kill you niggas or my name isn't Nell
Denzel with the blues, bet they can't rely on Eli
12 get the A when they see I
And they know just what we do, still tryna end true real nigga
Try and cop a feel and send em to the cotton field
Everything light bright in my eyesight
There goes the neighborhood is just a way to say white flight
They hate at first sight, cause love will never treat em but a right life gotta give em light
But we live our right

I know you don't understand
I done lost too many friends, I'm just hoping that you'll beam me up with you

[Verse 2: Denzel Curry]
All I see is the opposite plotting
Niggas get kilt like a skirt in Scotland
Who mad, crackers wanna box me in like plaid
But I got 'em spinning out of control, no Taz
Too many devils to deal with
Currently camouflaging the coat of chameleons
Blend, tricked by the Rumpelstiltskin
Saying I make all but tryna to take my ends
Real world one scene when I descend
Got a nigga crossed up like a quarter nick grin
I'm rock shit like ISIS, Isaac I'm Newton Huey when shooting, might as well recruit me

[Chorus: Twelve'Len]
Gunsmoke, gunsmoke
Gunsmoke, gunsmoke
They don't wanna see us go
They don't wanna see us, grow
Stepping down on the edge
Stepping out on the ledge
They don't wanna see us there
They just wanna see us here
[Verse 3: J.K. The Reaper]
Bodies on top of bodies they're always movin in silence
Cause'  I was runnin' at three in the mornin
Hopin' they don't find me
My words came under warning
You'll never see me in court bitch
It's hide n seek for every nigga in the street
Now errbody want a body
Errbody wanna beat it
Bigger bullet bustin' than anybody that got the heat
Errbody wanna talk, errbody wanna tweet
Why the pistol in the lining only hide it when the cops out
They were lookin' for a plea or a cop out
Droppin' bullets off inside a nigga Dropbox
Why they always tryna get into the hotspot
Niggas really lose minds, but not I
I done came from a place with a face every city never seen
But a jail cell popular
Just showin you what I see through my optical
This how a motherfucker sound when his options up

[Bridge: Twelve'Len]
I know you don't understand
I done lost too many friends, I'm just hoping that you'll beam me up with you

[Verse 4: Nell]
I done alot of wrong in my life, as I reflect on my inner thoughts I can see alot of wrong in my rights
I condone in the light
Cause the darkness within me tend to start
So I let the spark roam through the night
Cause I'm blind to the fact
A black man could barely survive an attack that the government's residents
Lash at his back
Stacks prove that the truth is bruisin
How people gotta act like they like it
But me, I could never wait
I must evolve with my fate
Fakeness dissolving the hate
This as real as it gets
Sinners get healed in the ditch
But life just goes on either way
[Chorus: Twelve'Len]
Gunsmoke, gunsmoke
Gunsmoke, gunsmoke
They don't wanna see us go
They don't wanna see us, grow
Stepping down on the edge
Stepping out on the ledge
They don't wanna see us there

Stayed around when I got buzz
Where was you when I wore floods?
Where was you way before I had the dreads with the gold slugs
Back then there was no love
On the news, they would leave my image skewed as a true thug
I worked hard 'til I drew blood
I'm on guard, let the smile transform into a new mug
Even when I wasn't shit I always knew I was a blueblood

[Verse: Denzel Curry]
True blood, vampire
Wanna suck the energy because I'm too fire
Only reason why I never have no drip on me
I'm allergic to the rain and the slips, homie
Everyday I'm thinkin' 'bout where could X be
Last thing he text me was: ""Text me""
And it's sad that I couldn't even text back
Now everybody wanna use him for they next track
I did a interview, they only talked about him
I thought the interview was talking 'bout the album
A million dollars, million views be the outcome
Deleted as a middleman, word to Malcolm
Care about your ratings, care about your savings
Care about your jewels and your cars on your pavement
Can't you understand that a momma lost her baby
Every other lyric that I heard said, ""Save me""

Worldstar cause a nigga wanna be star
Throw the fist, have a fit
Grab the clip, pistol grip
Make them flip, pass the spliff
Axe shit, pass the fish
You wanna pass the bitch?
Cause I'ma beat the pussy up like a grizzly
Til now it look like the roaches of my cheeba
Girl don't leak on my sneakers
Now there is spit on my adidas
Niggas are talking that shit so I'm rolling my reefer
Nigga wanna talk about a motherfucker

How does it feel? Oh, to me how's it feel
Oh, to know that you're pitiful (War)
How can you hate on a nigga who's working
Back to back to back to back
To get mom out of that cubicle
So don't call me while I'm at work
Building up my net worth
Cause it's my money and I need it now, now, now, now, now
Like J.G. Wentworth
And I know my haters wanna kill themselves
Every time I say a hot line
But before you do call 1-800-273-8255 (Yuh, yuh, yuh)

[Verse 3: Pouya]
My music immaculate, plus I am passionate when I be bashing it
Are you selling it or are you capping it?
Is you on the stale or are you clapping?
Bitch on fire like a match box
Still getting money in my tube socks
Pop the Glock, tear the roof off
Down the 9-5, quit my 9-5
Had no downsize, only uprise
Ain't no surprise
I did what I had to so I could surpass you
I got more styles than a fashion show in Paris
I'm the one that your parents made aware of
Be careful with that one
He's a scumbag, do not trust him
If you fall in love he gone leave you
The man got too many hoes he don't need you
That's the nonsense that they feed you
And you listen, cause you got no mind for yourself
And you probably got a hundred bodies under your belt
Regardless as I'm heartless in that department
When it come to my money I'm an army
By my lonesome, South Side Slugs
Putting on for the broke ones
It take one to know one
[Chorus: Pouya]
Get a full clip to ya lip
Talking slick, I ain't talking Gang Starr
Florida reppin'
The bottom of the map, we done came so far
You wasn't with me coming up
You not gone be when I'm on
In between your bitch like floss
You's a fraud, you ain't got the sauce

Sesame seedless, hood like Sesame Street is
If a nigga talking Oscar
Chopper turns the ghetto to a opera
So sing about me
But I'm not Mr. Duckworth
I am much worse when the city's mad
When your temple leaking, with a Maxipad
That's a pussy nigga thought, Sinister Hugo with the plot
Niggas talking jive, get the Glock
Pop, pop, pop, pop, keep a stock full of rocks
That be Onyx, color of skin that be honest
Ambient, I'm just rambling
About damages and I damned the shit
Like Queen Haughton as I crossed it
Holocaust it like a dyke playing lacrosse bitch
That means you can't hurt me
Now he flying like Captain Murphy
Raven Miyagi, shinobi has blessed it
Now my spirit is one with the essence
Another thug isolated
Reverse the birth so I could awaken

The colors together so what you call that?
That's African-Americans that's caught up in the trap
Like Minnie Mouse, Benny Rat
Lucky number seven clicking to the clack
When a nigga supposed thrash, motherfucking streets ain't safe
So i keep my eyes on my back
Niggas are the snake the rat, the cat, the dog
Ho, least police, the pig, the hog
These guys you are alliance with
Will be the cause of your downfall
They be lurkin' in the garden, see
The pass you like pardon me
Hardly see when you conversate

Repeats itself, niggas wanna take your wealth
Actin like they need some help
And leave you dealt, what I said before
These niggas just the enemy of their self

Never trust a bitch

On to other shit, callin' up the mothership
Pardon me, pardon me

Heart of a lion, niggas be lyin' to be hard as shit
Watchin' them fall offs like the victim of a Spartan kick
Sit back and feel it, and while these other niggas politic
Politician, bitch, I'm pocket-pickin' 'cause my pot is pissin'
Try to diss me like you never heard that verse, did on ""Kristi

Never been coochie, the only reason you salute me
Sergeant, sergeant! It's hard, it's smart, retarded
We chargin' your audience, my target
We starvin', I need protein and starches

It's carnage when Curry spit venom
Call the ambulance so they can put some shit in him
All they see was niggas in some all-black denim
Caught another flow because I caught momentum, ah

Sharper than a bee sting
Nigga, I am beasting to a point where I could be Sting

Meaning is a you-ting
Fantastic Four, but for Curry is the new thing
Back for the Mula, put this Cris with no Luda
I could reach for the sky, tell the stars I'm a shooter
Keep my pockets on FUPA, cheddar cheese and chalupa
I will hang with my niggas, but I ain't mister Cooper
Bitch, my name is the Curry

This how it go, we get the Fifth and the blow
Bitches and dough, you taking pics then you go
Popped a quarter bar then took a sip for my zone
I woke up from a nap and hit a bitch then I yawn
Pending is done, these niggas envy the one
Give me some grub, need complementary cups
Second they stutter, you little children should run
I swerve up in my pick-up just to pick up my bucks
This shit for fun, you niggas in it to stunt
Give 'em a run then watch 'em give up the love
Pending is done, these niggas envy the one
Quarter tank of gas but I'm still filling my cup

I'm bout to drown in the liquor I poured up
Feel like Peter Pan I will never get older
I will never, never land I fall, I fall hard
End up in Michael Jacksons backyard
Lord, captain of hooks when I fish for a bitch
But I might throw her back if the bitches cat fish
She want cashing with a bit of passion
I gets the paper, she gets the plastic
Grocery store, your are just a shore that a nigga will soon explore
Submarinas, subterranean, mediterranean
And figure out that we alien, that's Sigourney Weaver
Call me Julius cause I had to cease her
She want a nigga cause I built my feet up
Then she get me off like misdemeanors
It's so demeaning, that my flow is genius
Like a river had thoughts
Slithering niggas that tried to move and get caught
Sipping on liquor I'm moving in the right spot
I can write a novel if the crackas' wanna plot
Exploit, when the expo, exnay

Explain cold case when the court date

Ingonyama  [a mother’s knees fall into a puddle
of the blood she made herself]
Ingonyama [the slow song of a spirit rising]nengw’ enamabala
[the spirit is confused about where its body went]
4. Song: Oh I just can’t wait to be king

this is the part where they realize that black people dream
& our blood is indeed blood & our teeth, teeth
& the music is loud because the field was wide & the field was long
& we dreamed on simple things: shoes, our children back

this is the part where the racist cuts off his tongue, his wet, pink repent
he gives his eyes & his hands & anything that has ever assumed
a black body a black & burnable thing. He gives himself to the lions
& the lions feast & the lions are still a metaphor for black boys
& the boys, full of fear turned into dinner, fall asleep & they dream
yes, yes, they really do dream.







5. Song: Be Prepared

        for the stampede of tiny lead beast

for the jury not to flinch

        for the hands, wild in your wildless hair

for the darkest toll, your double down to get half

        for the man, ecstatic with triggers

to spread your legs while they search for drugs there

        for the drug there, for their mouths to ask that big question

to hear your history told to you over & over & over

        for it never to change.








6. Scene:  Mufasa Dies at the hands of his brother Scar

What did you expect to be different?
The hood (according to whiteness & the sadness of this film) is any jungle:

a brother kills a brotha

        the left behind body a forgettable meal
        for the dark, white birds circling above








7. Montage: Timon & Pumbaa teach Simba a music other than the blues

clip 1: the boy getting older in spite of everything

clip 2: the boy & the boy-friends smoking blunts
for once something else brown & on fire

clip 3: the boy who would be king with his mouth
in another man’s throne

clip 4: Timon & Simba singing
down each other’s throat

clip 5: Timba calling Pumbaa a faggot & they all laugh

clip 6: murals of all the dead friends’ faces

clip 7: funeral songs. small caskets

clip 8: red, blue, periwinkle, yellow, black, & blood-maroon rags

clip 9: flowers & picture frames on the side walk

clip 10: shot the boys laughing anyway

clip 11: shot the boys laughing in the sun

clip 12: shot the boys laughing in the rain

clip 13: shot of the boys not being shot







8. Scene: Simba comes home to kill his uncle

& even here, a black man
kills a black man, this awful cartoon, all the children cry
blood until their bodies are just bone on skin.

roll the credits, I must go weep. Why does Disney remind us
what we have learned:

        - one black light swallows another so easy
        - killing is unavoidable as death
        - the king’s throne is wet with his brother’s blood
        - the queen suffers too but gets no name








9. closing credits

say the name
of the first boy
you love
who died.
say it
& don’t cry.
say it
& love
the air
around your tongue.
say it
& watch
the fire come.
say it
& watch the son rise.Embed"
Black M,Underwater,"45 ContributorsUnderwater Lyrics[Verse 1: Denzel Curry]
Stick drill ravage
From medulla of the savage
Niggas sticking with the illest shit got more sticks than a cabin
Wet em up like Squarepants 'till the niggas start crabbin'
Rundown gun down like Birdman they clapping
BRRRTT!
What happened to that boy?
Niggas yapping then they pull a strap into that boy
Paramedics come stressing cause a nigga got wetted
Lurking low in the gardens watch his head get severed
I reign supreme, the world is mine and you can't do a thing
Cause you can't kill a God but a God can kill a king
Checkmate, fuck this shit you dead weight
You the type to make a jit heart race
Cut cable fuck niggas and what would that make you
The person in the mirror not looking so beautiful
Who is you nigga, mirror mirror in the bathroom
Am I gonna take a job to the back room
Later pimping down and hit em with that crack boom
Then I send her home and laugh like some old coons
By the store Life is fact the truth is cold
That's how you live 300 years more
Philosophy the prophecy is probably a robbery
Don't talk to me about, who's the motherfucking future
C9 bow down to your rulers

I got four niggas on the porch
Two niggas out the park
You better have your burner  tucked when walking after dark
Niggas be running reckless with their hammers ready to spark
Everybody is a target in the hood they playing darts
Taking them underwater
It's through the hood and past the wudz
Taking them underwater
So pass the wudz and roll them good
Taking them underwater
And drive my mess understood
Taking them underwater
I'll take you underwater

[Verse 2: Denzel Curry]
Okay this one’s for all my dogs
I do it for all of my niggas
For Lotto, Chinaman, and Tiarra pour out some liquor
Still thug livin'
Come witness the black vision, trigger finger itchin'
Brothers fall like thanksgiving, your heart is St. Nicholas
Merry Christmas American Psycho with Bale as the Christian
Bust your head like baby ? made of crimson
Where is he now I'm spitting genocide to niglets
Paraquiz back in the day, watch me form into bitches
Completes the masters, you bastards
Need to pass her, but the pastor, is an actor
If the rapture was to capture
Any mother fucker on this planet
I know that God’s an artist so he’ll pick a good canvas
So I let the bad ones perish
I found god inside the face that I’m starin', at
In my world Jesus is black and misunderstood
I’m taking y'all past to the wudz and say

Black M,Darius,"16 ContributorsDarius Lyrics[Verse 1: SDotBraddy]
Shout out to them niggas who ain't scared to let them triggers go
Fuck my cousin shooters who was snitching yea my niggas know
Fuck the witnesses and fuck the judge, just let my cousin go
They gave my nigga 25 to life like that's the minimal
Boy I'm from a city where niggas dont show no pity
With a nine in their hand they'll give you 9 like 50
Don't get jack son
If a nigga try to rob me, you'll see what I have in store
Yeah boy I pack son
This life is kill or be killed
When you're still, they'll steal with a steel
So when attacking, be packing the shit that's clapping
Or niggas will have you dead
No witnesses know what happened
When the 12 pull up, they'll circle the block 2 times
Followed by 24 right behind, that's the first 48
P.I.G.S interrogate us talking bout us on tape
You wanna black ball me go ahead and suck em
I'm screaming fuck em I never loved em
And never did really trust em
And this is not a fib or a tragedy
But a lesson on how not to treat your family
Cause we had alcohol and marijuana 40 oz beverages
Adolescents feeling pain resort to those as medicines
I'm cruising down the highway, get the fuck out of my way
Ice cubes in my drank and my car is smokey, celebrating Friday
Trouble stuck on my mental
I don't know what I'm about to get into
My shooters are in the back
They will act if we have any issues
They're visiting down from Georgia
Fucking shit up in Florida
Peer pressure is on my heart
And my fear is in the aroma (nigga)

Bruh, you acting like a bitch ass nigga
Peelin' down south and one route to count figures
Motherfuck friends, in the end we all sinners
Keep an eye on your family cause blood ain't thicker
Imported the water from the blood of pure life
Headed down to Miami with the mommies and fresh ice
Robbing and rolling and we got the Glock tied ?
And she about to give me something to light
Organized crime, mobbing, gudda, squadding
Would cop an Iphone but Steven was jobless
Enter the Dark Knight its time to start robbing
Look at my cousins in the whip, heads nodding
Gat toking, pistols hoking, nigga on your damn street
Put six in your chest now that's Lebron rolling with that damn heat

[Verse 3: SDotBraddy]
Most of these niggas, have no father figures
Their fathers the trigger now you paint the picture
With strokes of ways how to survive in this economy
They never did school but they learned trigonometry
Shits gets real in the field
Trying to free my cousin Dee
So my mind is of Michael Scofield
But them niggas was ratting and actin just like a tweener
When all they really would of got was a small misdemeanour
Thats why its killed or be killed is the mindset when you're coming from that jungle
All of my shooters have mindsets like Michael Buffer: they are ready to rumble
Choppers hanging out that window the motive was pretty simple
These bullets have minds themselves and these here were meant for your temple
Nigga get back, when you hear that sound get back
Motherfuckers try to rob us ya ass will get splacked
Now you niggas microsoft, we'll aim it ya Adam's apple
Try to test us and we'll go and get the Mack
When i pulled off in my civic with wrecking odours of Henny
My nigga said he need work and my niggas know we got plenty
So we met up later the night, shooters in sight
Everything seemed alright
Until I pulled out the work then he pulled out a gun
Motherfucker tried to take my life, come on
You know my shooters ain't having that
Grabbed the guns then they cocked it back
Then they gave him till 3...2...1 then they shot his back
Then I looked in my rear view can believe what I've seen
My shooters hopped out the whip
Them niggas fled off the scene
Like God damn
[Verse 4: SDotBraddy]
They say blood is thicker than water
I'm thirsty for family that won't change
And always keep it for 4 quarters
But wait..
The family scale is unproportionate
Ya son just got arrested and the crowd was recording it
So you can see Lemony Snicket all in my ear
Yea its unfortunate this event just had to happen here
But see my cousin was the shooter
Now I'm in the reptile room, with invertebrates and look alike medusas
I never did the ratting
Ratting will have niggas put cheese on ya head
Them shooters Green Bay packing
So dont D.I.E
Or it's R.I.P
With a head shot
Now they trying to see I.D

[Verse]
Prophet Ezekiel, AKA the prophecy
I had to give you my government so you'd know me properly
See this is my property, yet the system don't give a damn
Take Mars, remove the S, spell it backwards, I'm a ram
This the jam
See, everything is hot on this desolate planet
The type to put your satellite through some permanent damage
No diagnostics, all your drawers need to see a mechanic
Damn, we can't manage—man, we can't vanish
I can't speak robot, but I can speak Spanish
Seems a lot of real music has been forever banished
Evangelists of the sonic revival, from trip-hop into tribal
Not a fight over music, this is my fight for survival
How many robots? How many rebels?
How many lighters? How many levels?
How many monkeys? How many barrels?
Left in peril, death isn't the only thing that scare you
Toast to life

You're my painkiller
When my brain gets bitter
You keep me close
You keep me close

[Verse 1: Ruel]
I got front row seats for the parkside livin'
Feel like the one, but I'm one in a billion
Teenage cynical
And I don't really know
What's the point of livin' if my heart gets broken?
Drivin' on the road, waiting for head-on collision
Springtime funeral
I miss you, but I'd rather be alone
To keep me from

[Pre-Chorus: Ruel]
Heartbreaks, headaches
The doctor says I'm diagnosed with
Shit days, mistakes
But I'll be fine
But I'll be fine

'Cause you're my painkiller
When my brain gets bitter
You keep me close
When I've been miserable
And it takes forever
To let my brain get better

Okay, the pain kills with no hesitation
And my brain fills with no narration
Got the same shield that block all our hatred
Got the same chills when them thoughts are racin' about you
Talkin' flowers in various hues
Take a poem and make it the blues
If it's violence, then sirens are red
You won't talk 'til I'm under the bed
Pretty nasty, girl, forget what I said
I'm kidding, baby, I'm just out of my head
I've been thinkin' out Pandora's Box
Take your box and you keepin' the lock
And I'll keep it locked down for you
And I'm bound to you, how that sound to you?
Then spread like the flu
And that thought get around to you
[Chorus: Ruel]
'Cause you're my painkiller
When my brain gets bitter
You keep me close
When I've been miserable
And it takes forever
To let my brain get better

Lemon hands only using me for the limelight
Looking at my wrist, they reveal themselves when the time's right
When it's said and done, I can only see it in hindsight
Pull a Fetty Wap on these niggas and give a blind eye
I don't rock fake shit or fight soft niggas
I try to unite all my brothers cause I lost niggas

Only thing I pray for is Mookie to get his jit back

Overnight, Minneapolis on fire
Protestors leaving an auto parts store in flames
Others seen looting a local Target
Tonight was a different night of protesting

[Verse]
I walk around with confidence, plottin' on accomplishments
Plannin' somethin' radical in the cut, so anonymous
I don't fuck with my president, tried to block all Mexicans
If he hear this message, please don't send SWAT to my residence
The police keep on killin' us, hands up then they start to shoot
Bad enough I'm scared of them and afraid of my niggas too
I'm screamin', ""Black is beautiful,"" views are probably anti-race
I can see the fear in your eyes when you look in my face
We all been on this paper chase, the only way to keep us free
All I see is red and green, money soak when my foes'll bleed
I'm pourin' up my Hennessy, fightin' with my shadow self
End up back in therapy, next to God, that's what seems to help
Got a tat' of Malcolm X, other one is young Bruce Lee
Always practice martial arts, misinformed then you need to read
The truth they always hidin' in books because they always overlooked
That's all I need to say in this verse, and now here comes the hook

[Chorus]
Reportin' live from the depths of the abyss, I'm at risk
When I be talkin' to my people like this, raise my fist
I tell Trump and the office to suck a dick, bitch, I'm pissed
Reportin' live from the depths of the abyss, the abyss
Reportin' live from the depths of the abyss, I'm at risk

Black M,Raider Klan Phonk,"19 ContributorsRaider Klan Phonk Lyrics*Raider-Raider-Raider Klan, C$PG*

[Verse 1: Ruben Slikk]
Ruben Slikk, the nigga with that fucking tongue
I lick that pussy up, I had that bitch so sprung
Sucking my dick so hard she bit the skin of my fucking snake
Ruben fucking Slikk, I jack my dick and then I masturbate
24 times and skeet up in her face, just to feel the load in her fucking mouth
Tell that bitch to swallow the whole thing
Ruben Slikk, keeping that cocaine
Cause I make it rain
In the club with my trap-work and my pipework, mane
Pimp shit, mix this shit on up- a Mixologist
What they call a G, when they hating looking at my chips
Nigga check yo boy out, at the fucking ATM
I ain't got no bank account, I don't pay no taxes man
Nigga this is pimp shit, catch me with my ears glisten
Yeah I got 2 studs, in my right ear bitch
So I can hear clear, fuck her in the rear bitch
Bad boy shit, Raider Klan black flaggin'...

[Verse 2: Denzel Curry]
Yeah I'm leaving niggas shook
Denzel Curry in that untold chapter of your Harry Potter book
It's me, the P-R the I-E the S-T to the H double O-E nigga that is me to the priest
To the hood looks good, yeah its that Denzel Curry motherfucker
Already told you I am as cool as McFlurry
If you wanna drop me, and wanna try and attack; nigga you will get bit like a fucking Big Mac
Its that nigga named Curry, no chicken I'm killing bitches without the AK, lyrical spray
Hey!
What is there to say
Killing these cockroaches
Denzel Curry a flow bitch
Everybody knows that Denzel Curry got that white shit
Coke, bitch
Leave em cokey in the wet
Denzel Curry, I'm catching the wave
Let me go and sit, niggas transact
Off my bitch, off the fucking Raider Klan M.O.E gang
Denzel Curry about to rip this bitch with that Raider slang
Yeah, I come in this bitch ready to attack
Smack a bitch, chicken head, but I ain't no Project Pat
Let me pass it back, to the motherfucking 3-6
Denzel Curry, the one and the only, the nigga (?) I'm killing the shit like that, now..
You might also like[Verse 3: SpaceGhostPurrp]
Up on the motherfucking beat, trying to do this shit walking down the street
With the black trench coat
And I'm coming for your fucking throat
Wanna play these games, my nigga just know I'm not the lame
Spitting the motherfucking flow for the listeners
You already know these bitches ain't missing us
They kissing us
And my dick is on her face, kissing my nuts
My nigga I put her in her place
Bitch I'm the king, big ding-a-ling
Got the fattest, phonkiest sounds my nigga in the state ring
Old school, take it back to the '88
Already know my nigga got the .38, robbing
Niggas straight coming through, I'm knocking
Niggas heads off, my nigga I ain't stopping
And if you think that I'm a bitch
Come test me motherfucker, I'll throw your ass up in the ditch
Now listen, to the way I go hard
Throw the motherfucking beat while I ride through your boulevard
Nigga don't start if you think that I am a joke
Goddamn I'm so fucked up, like I was on coke
But I'm not, I'm sober
And I am going to come through in the fucking black Range Rover
The black vamp, and I don't give a damn
Nigga C$PG, Raider Klan; we going HAMEmbed"
Black M,Bwoii,"32 ContributorsBwoii Lyrics[Verse 1: Denzel Curry]
Who is that nigga that's intergalactically fucking all your bitches?
He's snapping and chatting our homegirl as she's sucking on my dizznick
God base, bad bitch, walk up to her sprinkle the sentence
Dip on a dose of this pimpin' equals submission at longer extension
My nigga you lame
Drug dealers be switching to Santa Claus instead of a cane
Nigga your memories are dropped
Denny Cascade better watch your brain
Fuck them other niggas mane
They're not icy, and they don't ball
Acid got me scattered brain
See my thoughts across the wall
Damn, and I'm an abyssal I'm more than a kid, so baby girl get the best of me
In and out and in and out continue my pimping legacy
Denny Cascade the universe is saying
Slumber in my bedpost as I meditate and lay
Blowing that Luke Skywalker kush, Reflex under my nigga I could
And if this ain't my nigga you hood
Pu Pu Pu Pu
You dead or you shook
Damn, real nigga still will kill niggas have you lying still nigga
Nah, nah for real nigga, but went up your Hilfiger

[Verse 2: Nell]
It's the notorious spitter, kicking it with my niggas
From the Vill, tryna bill all my niggas can keep it real
My people sittin' in cells placing robbery with a steel
Jumping numbers on every bail just so they can get out to kill
They arresting Lee Hart Infield living the life of a cotton mill
Enlighten by Christ so I see the wrong in my right
Every night he gon' off the marijuana from Cali to Arizona
I get bad bitch, bonus she bitch I hit homers
Gotta take you by the edge no stitch and give donors (daily)
Niggas on my side play crazy
It's new fake shot to wanna roll me the Glock
Drop it, but me I'ma do it like the players do
Mac witchu boo sipping purple juice
Your bitch wanna chill 'cause she know the truth
Is my clique too trill living virtual
(So clique too my trill living virtual)
(Clique too trill living virtual)
(My clique too trill living virtual)
(Clique too trill living virtual)

That ain't reality it's blocked the animality
That Denny possessed on the system on the exorcist anatomy
Radically rebellious to the fuckery and the faggotry, not as a caution that you cannot sugar me
Not by the doctor with boy with the Agassi that you got
I'm the antagonist to the plot of how America with three K's wanna see niggas got cake
That's the operation for the country separation
Segregate and divide and conquer they wanna see us dead, eh
Planet of the apes 'cause now niggas wearing Bape
Put a color in coordination that's why niggas hate on Dre
But he black too like a tattoo, report his color and
Trying to separate the kin from the mixture of the skin
Fuck a bitch B M Dub
'96 they killed the thug
Now it's us against the world new millennium niggas like us
Drop the late shit down but you prolly gone hear me just like believe me or not they'll look for you and Ripley (Why)
Why why

[Verse 4: JK the Reaper]
Fuck that though you don't gotta believe 'cause nigga like us all have weed
I got plenty shrooms when I walk in the room get any bitch here high off me
Tryna put the word through my penmanship
'Cause you don't get the shit 'cause your inferior
I'ma go slap on my interior boy
Tongue loud we ain't hearing ya boy
Trap the photo full who has been noticed me
Nigga in jail and I'm sending them photos
I hoping they know that I'm out here grinding for a muthafuckin reason
Clock niggas on the IPod season what is your meaningful dream
Better wake your punk ass up
Like Sway in the morning, I'm down and recording as early as hell
Quickly cops wanna throw me in jail, What the fuck? I just be coolin
You ain't dropped off shit let me school Ya
Don't let this rap shit fool Ya
I don't want beef, I illuminate until we see the gates and this God says that we face
As I kill the Sphinx with a rival verse C9 is like Steve Jobs birth
Nigga that's the future God glasses I see right through Ya
Fuck nigga when I fuck which and don't
No body no body fuck with my kitchen
'Cause we cooking the difference
You niggas ain't doing shit different
Respect my vision little boy15Embed"
Black M,Chrome Hearts,"20 ContributorsTranslationsEspañolChrome Hearts Lyrics[Intro: Denzel Curry]
I'ma have you put your lighters in the air
I'd like to introduce my main man, Zacari
Take it away, man

[Chorus: Zacari]
Hope is still right around the corner
Chrome Hearts on me feel like gold
Chrome twenty-fours jumpin' like Jordan
But in the night, I still slide in suburbans (Slide, slip)

[Post-Chorus: Zacari]
Still gettin' my hands dirty (Slide)
Still gettin' my hands dirty

[Verse 1: Denzel Curry]
I need cures and angels, pure and faithful
Walkin' that path could be painful
From innocent fun to guilty pleasures, watch it collide in the same view
I felt the effects of what fame do
When you not self-aware, it can change you
As I look at the past like abandoned
It's the little things that really made you
A main man, paid man, payin' for some Ray-Bans
That cost more than your rent while others struggle to get a cent
In a sense, I ain't shit, because it's many people starvin'
Tombstones of a selfish man, these words are carved in

Hope is still right around the corner (Yo)

But in the night, I still slide (Yo)

[Verse 2: Denzel Curry]
Just like the mask of Viktor Vaughn, you see, my heart's made of chrome
See, all these trials and tribulations got me trapped in my zone
Every part of my spirit become trapped in these songs
In these palms, I have my destiny, so I am not calm
Winnin' women been in bed sheets
Layin' and lyin' while y'all feel like dyin'
Fightin' for my life, is it worth it? What's my purpose?
On the surface, I'm just a mortal man, understand that
We make our own choices 'til the day we hand our soul back

[Chorus: Zacari & Denzel Curry]
Hope is still right around the corner
Chrome Hearts on me feel like gold
Chrome twenty-fours jumpin' like Jordan
But in the night, I still slide (Man)

[Verse 3: Denzel Curry]
I follow the golden pastures
My golden soul is not for these hoes to capture
I mix emotions 'til they remixed and mastered
Was lookin' disasters, lookin' at my life after
And even before I was goin' to war with these crackers
Writin' the end to my chapter, bless it with laughter
Pass the motherfuckin' weasel, I could achieve the greatest
Be the high, the curse of livin' forever is wantin' to die
I seen it all, been through it all
I love and I hate you all
The only thing I'm here to do is just evolve, dawg
[Chorus: Zacari & Denzel Curry]
Hope is still right around the corner (Shit)
Chrome Hearts on me feel like gold
Chrome twenty-fours jumpin' like Jordan
But in the night, I still slide in suburbans (Slide)

[Post-Chorus: Zacari]
Still gettin' my hands dirty (Slide)
Still gettin' my hands dirty

[Outro: Zacari, Denzel Curry, Zacari & Denzel Curry]
Duh-nah-nah-nah-nah (I like that, that)

I tried to keep these feelings in control
I've tried to find a reason not to show you
But every time I do, I give my all
Just can't let it go

[Pre Chorus: Gerard O'Connell & Katie Taylor]
And even if you say, even if you say no
I'm gonna fight babe
'Cause what I need has taken hold
And even if you play, even if you play dumb
It's not gonna change me (It's not gonna change me)

[Chorus: Gerard O'Connell & Katie Taylor]
If this is how real feels
Then I guess I want it
If this is how real feels
Then I guess I'm on it
If this is how real feels
Well it feels like falling
Yeah, I feel like falling

It will never be dark forever so get a glimpse
I feel though you
I, can't even deny
Girl you blew my mind
Can't forget you if I tried
In a moment, at my lowest, you get me back on my feet
My heart is cold and yet it been stolen
She won't give it back to me
I fell hard, I don't want to fall anymore
Fell hard, she don't want it all anymore
Rewind, it's like we been here before

Black M,DIET_1.5,"2 ContributorsChildsplay 2 Lyrics[Songtekst van ""Childsplay 2.0""]

[Intro]
Ey SB woub die lakkie man
Yarr the engineer
Welke block wordt vandaag gespind?
Veel chat maar niemand on-
Jump uit die, jump uit die, jump uit die whip met speed
Da's Jump Out Gang op een zone 2 neek
Oi oi

[Verse 1]
Zet een K op de K en krijg op je donder
OVJ zegt ik ben niet honderd
Maak rondes om mannen te verwonden
De duivel wil met me praten
Denk dat ik al met hem ben verbonden
On drills, die life is geen pret
Ik zou anders doen als we anders konden
Swing swing, ying ying
Voel me KK als ik grijp naar ding
Je hoofd die wordt open gechingd
Free NairoLoose, da's m'n violent twin
Zie je SK ga niet in een sprint
Want hij get je back en zet rams er in
Alleen door rebels omringd
Yolo, welke block wordt vandaag gespind?
Welke block wordt vandaag gespind?
On a 1-2-5, ik ben black gedresst
Met die wap op peds voor cash
Of ik lurk oppblock, ik wil paigons dead
Mad, gyallie vindt mij te gek
Ik nak het in trap sinds die 4-2 step
Diligent step in die Air Force black
Heb niemand gezien maar ga nog niet weg
Neem die L, ik zet het wel recht
We zijn op get back hier, niet op geklets
Wack, ze rijden niet echt
Wij doen het voor pret
Opp in zicht, approach in a sec
Doe die kikkestep voor die dode flat
Yo, anything F get whacked
En anything 2 get cheffed
Two man step, fuck up a opp-boys back
You might also like[Verse 2]
Step naar daar, zo van wie is op wie?
Achttien inch op mij voor heat
Run a man down als ik paigons zie
In the T met the baddest B
Brown skin, peng en ze rijdt de D
Die mannen daar willen geen heat
Back fast en swing op je G
Veel chat maar niemand on me
Back m'n chat, ik hendel die heat
Ten toes met rebels on me
Civilian ziet en denkt O-M-G
Yo yo, jump out die whip met speed
Da's Jump Out Gang op een zone 2 neek
Lurk in de twee of six
Zovaak op die block, maar niemand te zien
Maar niemand te zien
Heb een opp in m'n zicht, what's good?
Rammy on me en ik back met spoed
Zet hem laag in z'n eigen bloed
No get back, nu zijn ze bedroefd
Gyallie on me, on broski too
True, gyallie loevt wat we doen
Savage kid, badder than bad
Dick die bitch grof, ik nak het in trap
Let's go get lit
Ik loop vrij op die o-six strip
RS in spliff, z'n broertje tript
Heb hem gewhackt op die block van (..)
Bijna nog één in kist
Weet wat je zegt, je wil niet in spliff
Bid dat ik die wap back en mis
Wil je war, come try want we zijn op hits

Black M,Grotto Flow,"12 ContributorsGrotto Flow Lyrics[Verse 1: Yung Simmie]
I be off this herb
Puffing on the purp
Never smoking dirt
Now your feelings hurt
Why you watching me he gon' hit you first
Soul gon' touch the sky, bodies in the dirt
I'ma serve you up, you gon' get the work
The last nigga that tried me he got it first
Smoking on mars, I'm off this earth
I kill him with bars, leave beast in the Hearse
Money I'ma stack it
I'm all black it
Never am I lacking
Wavy like a captain
Came to get it cracking
Been about the action
We can make it happen
Nigga what it is
I been going hard for a million years
Never shed a tear flier than a Lear
Me myself and I, three musketeers
Smoking on loud I can't even hear
All you see is smoke then I dissapear
It's your worst day, but this been my year
Now I'm taking over I'm in fifth gear
I'm smoking on rover
Your rap days are over
This ain't your session you better move over
I swerve in the Rover
Mix Henny with Cola
Puff on that doja
I stand in my corner
Ain't pay a dolla I came with the owner
Now you looking salty
You thought that you saw me
I'm balling like Barkley
My weed lit like Barkley
Get yo main lady
She all on top of me
Getting real money you playing Monopoly
It ain't no stopping me
It ain't no dropping me
Get hella high then I laugh like it's comedy
This ain't no Twitter, I made yo bitch follow me
Later that night, it was yo bitch toppin' me

Captain of the sea
Intergalactically
I'm a catastrophe
With no gravity
Can't flow after me
Smokin' on the tree
Pass the Grabba Leaf
Roll the Grabba Leaf
Grab the Mac and squeeze for my mac n cheese
Niggas and bitches, oh why you actin' like dog to eat
I am magnifique, magnificent
Just like Eminem
My style infinite
My weed chiefing
My dro blazing
My bitch bad, my flow amazing
Tryna comprehend
Like going through mazes
Don't try to flex 'cause my brother's crazy
Put that on motto
I lead and you follow
So check my bravado
I'm smashin' movato
Money the same color as avocado
You never had bitches
You're Johnny Bravo
Why pretend to be
Try befriendin' me
Pulling out the AR
Son [?] of my enemies
Frenemies, you never been my friend
I been to places you never been my friend
Fuck with me that's yo end my friend
I need money I need m's my friend
Goddamn, yeah I been everywhere
Overseas, over the world I don't give a fuck

Oh, this shit sound hard
Listen

[Verse 1]
Made it out of the rubble
Jake Gyllenhaal body 'cause I'm stuck in my bubble
My parents tell, ""Be humble""
'Cause they silencin' my dawg so that casket a muzzle
Though I never push weight I still higher through muscle
Girl, you fucked the first night, how the fuck can I trust you?
Reason why they call 'em hussies 'cause they in for the hustle
See, every day I'm on this Earth like a Everyday Struggle
I try to run through all these bitches when my girl wanna cuddle
Bend to epidemics, my mind sick
I'm not worried 'bout academics since '96
Matter fact, a nigga been rappin' since '95
Let my ego trip but I'd rather keep it aside
Everybody worried 'bout the cash that I'm makin'
'Cause the pigs on my ass 'cause I'm bringin' home the bacon
'Cause one fateful day I teamed up with a Jamaican
With dreams and aspirations who believed that I could make it
I sat around and watched my heroes spawn
But most of them are assholes so now my heroes gone
People dyin' every day, yet the beat goes on
I kept it cool but let me show you what my ego's on

At the same time they bitches try to meet and greet me (Yeah)

Niggas these days is ready to shoot a nigga instead of poppin' a cop
Well, these niggas, I'ma tell 'em how it is my nigga
Comin' from my mouth, strictly for my Raiders

[Verse 1]
This song goes out to the motherfucking cops and to the po-police
Wanna see you pop a nigga, wanna see you kill a nigga, no justice, no peace
Know niggas wanna grab that gauge around that motherfucking Blackland
CC where I be, motherfuckers 'round here wanna kill a black man

[Bridge]
Bitch, you let us, bitch, you let us
Bitch, you let us, bitch, you let us
Bitch, you let us, bitch, you let us
Bitch, you let us, bitch, you let us

[Verse 2]
Niggas wanna talk that shit
Always sayin' you a gangsta, but real niggas know you a bitch
Had a couple homies that hit a couple licks
That what you expect when you never had shit
Growin' up in the mothafuckin' slums
With a fuckin' gun to your mothafuckin' gums
Then pop a nigga in his mothafuckin' lungs
Two shots and you dead, your little ass is done
Increase with the skill, right now it's fuck how you feel
The way I get to it, you get chills
Niggas they claimin' they trill
All because they rockin' a slug and they grill
Quit faking the phonk, immortal words from my nigga Key
Bitch, I could rock a pink shirt, polka dot hat and still do me
Real nigga to the letter, Goddesses, they gettin' wetter
When niggas get out of line with the real, the semi just might bless ya
But coppers wanna take your life more than you wanna take mine

Cause they feel a threat, cock that beam and aim it at your chest
No I'm not wearin' a vest, don't really care, 'cause this life is a test
My soul relieved, nigga, not trippin' I won't spaz
Remember Trayvon Martin then I blast on Zimmerman's ass
It's amazing how they'll lock me up for petty shit
Though I cannot live this life like this, but I keep takin' it
Darker the flesh, the tighter the noose
They callin' us coon and they callin' 'em goose
Look at my flesh, dig deep in the roots
The shit that I speak is the blend of the truth
Nowadays, all these mothafuckas hittin' shipe
Yes, I was born in this world but since I'm black I'm born with a strike, bitch

To every competitor, and to any challenger
Have, gold bullets rocking inside your temple, Metallica
What happens when murder and mix 'em with Galaga
That's too many niggas that's calibrating with calibers
Excalibur, killin' all through the book of lies
Livin' upon a revelation, but as master in disguise
I'm master in disguise, elevated you and I
Counting sticks and body parts, options when is join or die
Count to 2, grab the 9, all these suckers are clouds
'Cause their fantasy is final destination underground
To a dirt freak accident, A young Devil's advocate
Goin' Ham on the Madison, and poppin' his bitch from the cabinet
I keep locally Madison, before an undergraduate
Jobs closin', now you coppin' that brick from the ocean
All your life you have been focused since your mom wasn't open
Face shine inside a box now it looks like you votin'

[Verse 2: J.K. The Reaper]
From where the slogan was survive in Atlanta that holds the zone of war
More killers bribe with contraband, but they playin' Contra, fuck around
Tryin' to meet the next level and minimize the coppers
The CPU and cheat codes won't work
20 years old can't afford a lawyer, momma said he should've went to church
Stop by, I'm smokin' in another universe
As my whole planet gets worse, I'm blasted if I could rule the world
On my way back to Earth
And see all of the out of the day gloomers
Inter-galactic storm troopers keepin' my brothers captive
So don't ask me if I believe in magic
If I answer, I say it only exists in drugs
And god is a mirror 'cause his image is in us
Holy water drippin' down her body hurry up get a cup
Down a [?] in panties hopin' that she wasn't naked
Same outfit as Eve, I'm not Adam, but I'm still sacred

Before explain to me how we not the chosen one
Seven stars in my hand, and a blade on my tongue
Whether a god is a profit, illusion optic
Clocks stop it, had to pause it, fundamental brain deposit

Put in logic, no emotional [?] shit
Holy as the cross that Jesus walked in, to the Crossroads
I don't see no Bonethugs, all I see is Thugbones
Stone cold the pegasus is arson
Radiate flows like sippin' water out the faucet, bitch

[Verse 4: J.K. The Reaper]
Custom plated and put it in a scribe
If we start a revolution, it needs to be televised
But it will be only for the viewers that's watchin' with open eyes
I despise you critics that interfere with your lies
I'm on an acid tab havin' intercourse with the sky, fuck the world
I'm gonna elevation the minds, fuck the world

That's Chinaman and Tiara
Moments play back in my mental about the last night of terror
Am I scared of dying, more of a bullet flying
Enter my window and hittin' my kinfolk, sit back with a blunt and I’m sighing, bored
I hear niggas knocking at the door
Talking about some crucial shit like Cascade
This shit is war round these parts
This shit is on your porch or even at the park
Shooting your bloods and your nigs out the dark
Then they jump out and get caught by a narc
13 round from the sound of the chopper
Guaranteed dropper
Go on and let the hammer bang
Like Bob the Builder they fix it and rang
AK-47, 30 second to 47, fill it up with Mac-11s
Eating church's chicken reverend

As I plot the rock, god Ra make em rot
Run up on me best believe you get got

Like where was you when I was running the block?
When I snap, crackle, pop I'm a serial killer
Wait, I'm a cannibal, Survival of the Fittest, the prodigy
Of Hannibal, Rudy, let's have a face off
On John Travolta, wet 'em, Super Soaker
Stop, the double Glock pop on the knots
B, we keep it G to the C note, we so
Below zero froze I'm sub Niño
The crack era repo was lethal like Ethel
333 times 2 multiply to a million
You not my kin, uppercut into the ceilin'

Shots to his head, Buddhist
He cluelessly sleeping and brutally beaten
I'm doing the reaping, now rest in the ditch
The maggots gon' eat him, decompose the demons
His ass gon be leaking and restin in piss

But I’m just a motherfucker that wanna suck dick
Hole stretcher, twenty men in my bed, and their bussies never redder
They were splooging as their fucking ass bled
My penis givin’ sex to my cum pets
Strokin’ in the bed while I cum-press my erection
Starin’ at his violet sequin studded tights, now my dick’s high as shit
I’m tryna get it high as I can before I go and stroke a guy
My ass is nothing but an empty case, black bros givin’ sex
Dick bang, cum plague, swallow tips, givin’ brain, givin’ head
I feel like I want neck so I’ma come fuck all my gays
I’ll even fuck the dead, I’m bleeding semen, d-composin’ in a grave
I’m black but yet my hole’s blacker
I can feel my bone shatter from the pole splatter
Blood and cum paints the wall
Those stains won’t dissolve, gonna have to paint it all

[Chorus: Hydracoque & Sam Hyde]
It’s not fair, I found cum
It made me gay, my dick’s fat
You’ll never…
Shoot hot cum everywhere!
If my cock’s strong, it just might
You might also like[Verse 2: Hydracoque]
Always goin’ through the motions ‘til my cock is fuckin’ broken
Think I’m jokin’ when I’m talking about stretchin’ my ass open
‘Til I’m strokin’ on my cock, playin’ with my balls emotionless
Dick stiff, thoughts of niggas all up in my open pit, shit
Always search for big dicks, penis printin’ though the britches
If life’s a game of inches and my dick has been the biggest
I’ll fuck all bros in the world until my fuckin’ nuts are twitchin’
Gape fistin’, gay jizzin’, creampie and blame my addiction, bitch

[Break: Hydracoque]
It’s not fair, I found cum
It made me gay, my dick’s fat
You’ll never—oh shit, ah shit, the song’s over
Goddamn, nigga
Ayo, where my dildo at?!

[Verse 3: Hydracoque]
I’m stickin’ my dick in a nigga what else can I do, man?
Not much, but I take it myself, I give and receive it
I twist and squeeze it, I lick it and I please it
I ain’t finna tell
I’ma lock it all up in my closet, the place where my penis and balls sit
When I don’t deposit them deep into gay niggas’ ass sockets and pop it and lock it
Sometimes when I go and stalk it
My cock is a rocket and I am an astronaut
Fucking’ male ass a lot, suckin’ a cock like a camel deep into my castle
I feel like my shaft is in Camelot
And I tape it so it is on cam a lot, I can’t not hump niggas from the back
To stop this would be to lay down my mighty shaft and not assdamage thots
But only males, I keep ‘em on a chain and give ‘em anal tails
Then jack their prolapsed poopers ‘til they slime on me just like a snail
My sexual crimes, these rhymes entail, I’m strikin’ males and I prevail
As the gayest nigga to ever exist, to ever anally fist
To ever rock that nigga sex Rolex on my fucking’ wrist
Or in other words, I’m fucking gay, nigga!
Ouchie, man!Embed"
Black M,Dark Tournament,"16 ContributorsDark Tournament Lyrics[Verse 1: K-Trip]
It's a trip how niggas'll change quick
From real to low dick, from trill to straight bitch
So I be with my clique, cave be the side
No lie, 305, my nigga, where I reside
Where them hoes get down, niggas run down
Click, clack, pow, ? the sound, you better get down, nigga
Give me my crown, I'm the best in the booth
K be a trip, nothing less than the truth
Stay in my vibe, get high on herbal
Geeked like Urkel, but bad like Kirko
Bitches play, but fuck it, cause I'm from Dade
Where hoes get sprayed cause they just want to hurt you
My city fucked up, niggas dying everyday
Mentality where I stay, you ain't saved, no K
Up five boom pap, let 'em lay, all black
Blackland, batcave, bitch I'm 'bout money
And they want to play, my dog on the block
Didn't make it to your teens, then he probably got shot
Little jits getting got, the block too hot
On one knee, putting money in my socks
On two knees, praying up top
Hoping that the bullshit stop
But no time soon, so I carry the boomer to boom
I'm telling you fucks that I won't lose, K-Trip, nigga

Suicidal bombers on that DMT
So I'm killing 'em, trying to become a legend like I'm William
Killing 'em softly, searching for a refuge
But this ain't Lauryn Hill, do lacerate and say I kill
Like the bastard that I are, contradiction, I got a father
Mischevious little boy, really, who's the oddest toddler
Like I'm low-key, really though, I'm oddly, I'm Godly
Niggas raid your clique like the Killer Klan Posse
Killer Klan Kasi, I see pussy, I'm CAT scan
Dark niggas in the night, bitches thinking I'm Batman
Name's Denzel and I'm far from a Christian
They'll reiterate the sentence, love God and no religion
Benzes will make you commit a 187
To me, I think it's senseless like a demon, priest, and a reverend
Raven Miyagi, that nigga, I be the master
What happened to that bunny on Tyler? So the dick was fatter?
No, that's Franklin, Donny's best friend
There's a ""E"" on the end of nine cause you 'bout to meet your end
66, 6-3, dropping like a 6-4
Killer, killer, killer, hitlist or that Death Note
Autographed by Justin Beiber, the future like HR Giger
Left hollow like Ichigo, Grim Reapers, and Soul Eaters
I don't give a fuck if you eat a pile of shit
If Denzel's lame, then you are a pile of sticks
Get it? Aquarius Killa Miyagi
Niggas that copy come with Kakashi ripping and kicking the lyrics karate
With a Bugatti, ride with a shotty, cause they might try to murk you
Trapping niggas in trapezoids, watch out for your circle
Like that
[Interlude]
Voice 1 : You own the throne not me
A tedious technicality but we are men of honor
Don't you worry though, we'll get your prize yet
As long as my body continues to shrink at this pace I'll no doubt be dead within the span of a year
Voice 2: Right, the low human diet's working wonders for you
Voice 1: As for the matter of my throne, you'll have to get much stronger to fend off my enemies

[Verse 3: Soulja Mook]
Alone as I howl to the moon in the dark
Raised by the wolves since the very fuckin' start
Twisting my ratchet I'm clickin' and klackin'
Chop off your head and get placed in the basket
You actin', nigga just know
Put them paws on your ass like Simba did Doa
I'm a wolf trueblood to death
Say my name twice and you cursed like Macbeth
Call it spirit gun when I'm lifting your soul
Only fear of god when everyday I grow old
'Cause these demons be walkin' and haters is talkin'
While snitches is stalkin' they killin' so often
Hatin' ass niggas just know
Soulja Mook in this bitch and let these niggas know
I'm a wolf in the jungle
Concrete nigga like ya'll boys wanna play
Lead an army, niggaEmbed"

Black M,Denzel Curry Freestyle | LA Leakers Freestyle #145,"12 ContributorsDenzel Curry Freestyle | LA Leakers Freestyle #145 Lyrics[Intro: Denzel Curry, DJ Sourmilk, Justin Credible]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
L.A. Leakers, Justin Credible, DJ Sourmilk
Let's do it today
Bro, live from Redbull Studios in beautiful Santa Monica, California baby
The beautiful Redbull Studios man, Power 106 is here
Yes
Denzel Curry is here to set a tone today
Oh man, Dade County
Ey, we ain't come to play around, he said just drop the beats man
We gon' get right to it
Yeah, drop the beat
Let get this shit poppin' man
Denzel Curry, L.A. Leakers Freestyle, comе on
Oh boy
Alright, let me see what I got so far man
We hеre baby
My heart poundin'
Come on baby, it's go time

Part I: ""AHHH HA"" by Lil Durk

[Verse]
Zel finna slide on the beat, okay
Let a nigga ride with the heat, okay
I got bars for everybody, feds gon' call that a RICO case
I don't give a damn what your ego say, 2018 had a emo phase
I'ma offset the game like a Migo play and a nigga go ape like I'm Nigo Bape (Woo)
Rappin' but it's hard to believe it, actin' like you movin' bricks
Cappin', you'se a quadriplegic, nigga, you ain't movin' shit
Blackened bitch, we slaughterin' demons
Thought I wouldn't use a blick
Had to ask these niggas out, just like a ho I used to hit (Come on)
Niggas say I'm broke because they haven't seen my safe yet (Come on)
Freshman of the year and he ain't even talk to Ye yet (Okay)
Am I the only nigga that the radio ain't play yet?
But my checks still unfoldin' like a Barbie House Playset (Wooo)
'Cause I be gettin' money, so I'm smart to put the rest aside
Niggas snitchin' on they self, they need to eat some pesticide (Facts)
I ain't tryna say what you doin' wasn't justified
But how they test you're gangster then you go ahead and testify? (Come on)
Why you tryin' other niggas thinkin' you ain't next to die?
I'd be paranoid, shit I'm sleepin' and I'm next to fight
Peyton, AI, Tiger, they gon' put me where the best reside
Come back like I'm Jordan, bet he won't test me with this .45 (Uh-huh)
'Fore I ride the wave (Oh), I rather get hit by a bus
All this shit is sus, it's like grown men in Toys ""R"" Us (Ha)
He tried to pull my card but he ain't seein' Royal Flush
This is my opinion nigga, I ain't sayin' much
Lookin' up to the goats and no I'll never degrade 'em (Yeah)
But didn't Kobe admire Jordan before he played 'em? (Yes sir)
When Ali was the champ wasn't Frazier callin' to fade him? (Yes sir)
You beat the best to be the best, my ultimatum (Mhm)
Ain't no way that I'm followin' men, I'll navigate 'em
And ain't no way I'm followin' trends when I create 'em
You lookin' at the future my nigga, you can't escape it
You'd rather wait for niggas to die to say I am the greatest
Fuck y'all
You might also like[Interlude: Denzel Curry, DJ Sourmilk, Justin Credible]
That boy Denzel ain't playin' no fuckin' games
Oh, he, he got a point to prove, come on man
He comin' in here spazzin' (swingin') on that L.A. Leakers Freestyle
Swingin'
Man I'm comin' in hot, comin' in hot
You got another round? You got another round brother?
Do I have another round?
Let me see, let me see, let me see
Somethin, somethin' else in the clip?
Man hold up, turn the beat up, turn the beat up in my head for me
Okay, okay, okay
I'm feelin' this shit, I'm feelin' this shit man
Well let's go get it then baby, Denzel Curry's here
L.A. Leakers
I gotta murder everythin' down touchin', you feel me, fuck it
Go season baby

Part II: ""Just Saying"" by Jeezy
[Verse]
20/20 vision, let my future form a distance
That's so Raven, Miyagi's a little different (Mhm)
In my premonition, I only picture my infants (Mhm)
Rugrats, skip all the talks about Dr. Lipschitz
Tryna keep the balance, be honorable and sadistic
Lost a lot of homies but in my dreams they revisit (Huh)
Lookin' at the world without lookin' forward to Christmas
Should I be a Buddhist, Jehovah's Witness or Christian? (Let's go)
Satan's out the question
With the way the industry ran, you gotta have a fuckin' death wish
Just to get views or to be viewed as a legend
But call a nigga corny when you hear he got a message
Damn, I know a nigga preachin' like a reverend
My head is out the box like Seven
Call me Pandora, martial arts elevate my aura
Fire spit make you tempura
There is no order (Yeah), I am number one, fuck a top five
Yeah, them other niggas cool buddy but they are not live
For the fact, them other niggas are not I
Too fly, compare me to Marty McFly
No Biggie, I'm rappin' like I'm from Bed-Stuy
Bustin' off the top of the dome, my mind is war cry
Truthfully the realest of all, that is no lie
Put me on the track with the best and they'll be no tie
I'm sayin' no
[Outro: Denzel Curry, DJ Sourmilk, Justin Credible]
Oh shit, yo
Yo, cool him off, he's, he's on fire
How many, how many Redbulls you have 'for you came in here?
He turned up
Man just turnin' the fuck up
He turned up man, crazy energy, energy baby
Denzel Curry, yes
Appreciate you droppin' off those bars with us man
Thank you
Yo, appreciate you bro
Man, shit

But now finna show y'all like the second half of the film

Black M,Stadium Starship,"10 ContributorsStadium Starship Lyrics[Intro: Big Moe]

[Chorus]
Deep in the galaxy, indigo vert
When I swerve, coming down, when I swang through
Stadium starship be boomin' like Metro
Can I phone you home with my Bluetooth?
Gold on my grill and my Glock is gray matter
Some niggas be hollerin' 'bout truce, truce
Beam me from misery, Pegasus symphony
Riding black hoes in a black coupe
Denny Cascade the majestic Messiah
Pronounced as the funkiest Jesus
Stranded in Zone 3 my nigga
I'm zoning with LSD tabs in my grapefruit
Sighin' rewindin' about the last time
That my nine would cock back and would chase you
Think of my honey, I'm buzzing, I'm bugging
About the last time I would taste you, hate to

[Verse]
Burst your little bubbles like it was blossom and buttercup
Got niggas in the hood, be shootin', shoutin', and other stuff
And then ya' mama cryin'
In a ball, she crunchin' up, her walls pixilate
From the swift of the angel dust
Beware of the pale horse
Revelation minus caving, rippin' the sound chords
C9 is the future year, is 2055
Come with me into Atlantis so we can stay alive

Employing this soldiers that's ready for war

(Everywhere I go) All the ladies love me
Your girl wanna fuck me, begging me to hug me
(Everywhere I go) Yeah, I'm sipping muddy, counting up the money, you can't get none from me
(Everywhere I go) Repping my city, couple hittas with me, Glock to your kidney
(Everywhere I go) Bitches screaming Simmie, wanna get with me, but I ain't friendly

[Chorus:] Denzel Curry, Yung Simmie
(Everywhere I go) Rolling with savages, crew full of niggas like civil rights activists
(Everywhere I go) Back like I'm Lazarus, it's hazardous if I come up and snatch your bitch
(Everywhere I go) Kill a show, then make a couple then she asking when Curry comin' back
(Everywhere I go) Simmie-Curry is magnificent, fuck that other shit, I'd rather fuck your bitch, bitch

[Verse 1:] Yung Simmie
Off in Carol City, but we call it the Blackland
When niggas get backhand, we hop in our black vans
Grinding every day, gotta stack up my stacks man
Sleeping in my city, that's how you get jacked man
I'm cooling with white chicks, they wearing all black man
I'm sipping that kickstand, while niggas get kicked out
I'm holding my wrist out, speeding in that Benz
Bout to pick up your bitch now, she grabbing my dick now
I told her to get down, cause haters is watching
You niggas don't get pussy, I'm changing the topic
You niggas don't get fresh, you shop at Hot Topic
And I'm on Cloud 9, I can grab me a comet
Opinions never matter, I'll piss on your comments
I'm cooling in Cali, I got hitters in Compton
Flying to Miami, got a bitch in her panties
The way I drop bars, they should give me a Grammy
I cop a whole O just to smoke with my granny
I smoke all day, the weed man my daddy
Everywhere I go, I be speeding through traffic
With a bad bitch, I don't fuck with the ratchets
My nigga got a stick, he'll let you have it
Glocks under pillow, clips under mattress
Everywhere I go, I'm a fucking chick magnet
Grocery store, pick a bitch, then I bag it

[Verse 2:] Denzel Curry
All about Pesos but my name isn't Pedro
Everywhere a nigga go getting money for my shows
If you do not have my money then I'm double-edged, a foe
Ni-niggas think they bothering, not even a semi-pro
Simmie let the semi go on these fuck niggas
It seems like everywhere I go I'm seein' fuck niggas
The only reason why you niggas hating in the first place is cause deep down, bro, you really wanna fuck with me
This is not the time to preach, boy
Society's a cyborg but Imma beast, boy
Everything is heat, boy
Niggas saying they street, boy
The way I go hard is like making Black Sabbath look like the Beach Boys
Dope bars equals a Percocet, anybody I murder next isn't a Malcolm X, niggas is out to flex
Shit changed ever since a nigga dropped 'Threatz'
So when I got the call that Lotto was in cardiac arrest
Barely impressed by these niggas sneak disses, when I tried to be friends with them niggas I didn't mention
My nigga, friends don't exist
I'd rather get a Jennifer Anniston looking chick, and probably put her on the strip
That pimp shit in my veins, Cascade is the name
I'm outta this world, buddy, you can stay in your lane
So far from my lane, but yet I used to be
Why should I lie now? I'm keeping it true to me
[Pre-Chorus:] Yung Simmie
(Everywhere I go) All the ladies love me
Your girl wanna fuck me, begging me to hug me

Gotta watch these niggas around you, 'cause they might not be who you think they are
'Member she used to clown you, now she tryna come fuck all on a star
My nigga just got them pounds through, riding 'round town tryna dodge the narc
My other nigga got your main boo, he gon' fuck that bitch then break her heart
Used to bring the stolos through now I'm pulling up in a new NASCAR
Used to be an average joe, but now I fuck the baddest broads
Turned up on these niggas, I don't see me ever falling off
I know niggas hating, so I got my niggas toting rods

[Verse 1: Jackboy]
Catch an opp slipping, knock him out his tennis
Down to catch a case, tryna get ahead of business
Clean the block with the mop, I ain't leaving no witness
Claiming he a bitch, show up in a nigga kitchen
Dior on me, got me feeling blessed like a Christian
Came from shit and made millions
Ran it up fresh out of prison
I'm a gift to the game, no riddle
Fuck your handout, I ain't tripping
Got his bitch with me, I'm pimping
Glock on me got a nigga limping
Glock on me, you could go missing
Cartier on my vision
Shitting on you niggas like a pigeon
She fucking with you, she a duck, quack
I took her from you with a big sack
What I took from you, can't get back
You niggas broke as fuck, need to fix that
Yeah, you gotta watch your bitch plus you gotta watch your dawgs too
Just 'cause he say he real, that don't mean he ain't flawed too
Just 'cause he tote a steel, that don't mean he'll pop you
Only riding with the ones that I know gonna drop you
Wanna be a hot boy, well, I got hot shells
I'll slap you with this pistol, don't kiss and tell
Niggas going police tryna send you to jail
Niggas really hurt, you ain't in no cell

Real shit, I don't gotta act hard
Know niggas throw hands in the backyard
No glove, no wraps or a mouthguard
You can swipe all day, but I pull cards
What I'm saying is I never had to do fraud
When the old girl working 'bout two jobs
When the old boy applied for a new job
So I guess that I'm blessed by the true God
See, back in the day, I would hop in the Lexus, just me and my manager hoping it start
Here in the present, I'm stacking my scrilla all off of the shit that I said from my heart
Haters get mad when they see that you the big dawg, but they won't bite and I bet they don't bark
Mad over hoes, you a motherfucking simp, son, your niggas Maggie and Lisa and Bart
I watch 'em all try to ether me, just because they cannot eat with me
I read the bible, I know 'bout betrayal, I get reminded by a Jesus piece
Perfect match, put my soul to beats, my brother with me, he gon' hold the heat
Doing things I supposed to do, to be that nigga I supposed to be

[Verse 1: KXNG Crooked]
KXNG Crooked, Eastside, Long Beach, California
My name is KXNG Crooked
I snap on you rappers often
When I'm spazzin' I'm just gettin' my passionate point across
Like a hood cat clappin' his hands when he talkin'
Now that I got your attention, I feel I should really mention
Don't come around here flossin', Big Willies, we Willie Lynch 'em
Pull out the chopper, rappers hittin' the ground
Like every bar's a bullet, when I pull it, it sound like
Ba-da-da-da-da-da-da a couple of bullets are comin' your way
Then it jam, like God damn
Then I pick up somethin' quicker, start killin' everything in the vicinity
The proximity, the Glocksimity, we on Yosemite Sam
Bam, bam your body drop, Van Damme, karate chop
The Beretta's a better competitor
Pop pop turn your sweater to a crop top
Killin' you and whoever in that drop top
Etcetera, etcetera and it will not stop
Just shoot, shoot like doot doot
And beaucoup, beaucoup, I'm cuckoo
I'm a star goin' to war with you clones like Count Dooku
I'm worlds apart from you rappers
Like I walk in the booth rockin' a biosuit made of plastic
And NASA's galactic elastic travelin' through space, interstellar rapping
Broadcastin' from uninhibited planets
When I come back, that's it
You see a flash in the sky, it's that nigga, I
When I land, you wack niggas die
And your casket is your last hit
You wack bitch, fuckin' bastard
Back to the hand clappin'
You die quicker than Darren Wilson walkin' through Ferguson
Dressed like the grand dragon of the Klan
Passin' niggas with pants saggin'
With they hand on a black Magnum
To clap him backwards
So their last words is ""kcuf meht nmad saggin""
That's backwards for ""fuck them damn niggas""
Buck them damn triggers
You charge us, bodies fill up them damn Rivers
'Cause everybody wanna be the best rapper alive
But I only like dead rappers
Compare me to the best rappers who died
And you rappers I used to look up to
I gotta cancel you now
Like Simon Cowell, I can't let you ex-factors survive
Nah, the time's right and they finally limelightin' the god of this rhyme writin'
My mic can only be likened to Poseidon's trident and Zeus' lightnin' strike
And my metaphors are what Thor was to the Norse viking
I'm a born titan and at-point kill 'em like swordfightin'
I'm slicin' organs with songwritin', I dwarf giants
I hope I'm rubbin' you pussies wrong sort of like poor dykin'
I smoke philosophy, I snort science
That mean I'm higher than higher learnin', look in my eyes
That's where the fire's burnin'
Try to deny a music messiah's returnin'
You die and you fry in my iron furnace
I am on my get rich or die tryin' like when Em was signin' Curtis
'Cause I am murderous

Now we can do this a couple of different ways, it really depends
Could give them classic NY jeans over the Timbs
Or I could spit about my car and how it sit on the rims
Or I could tell you why I'm hot and disappear like MIMS
But the bars there, put that on God, ask a atheist
And if I ain't the bomb at least I'm in the blast radius
I'm beating these kids' indictment, shit, I like the terror
APB on my actions, I'm in the viking era
Moment of truth, I give you facts right now
Fuck this cypher, my mind ain't on rap right now
So it's fuck metaphors and punches, all the witty shit
Got a missing uncle and another need a kidney flip
Face says I been stressed
I got an aunt getting her ass kicked by MS
Nigga, why am I here? For the look, for the promo
Shit that bothered from the start
'Cause the cancer left his lungs and it's on my grandfather's heart
Yeah, just not the side that the beat is on
I'm supposed to put that to the side when the beat is on
I'm planning the funeral, I'm getting the hearse ready
These niggas only wanna ask me if the verse is ready
Not a how do I feel, not a how do I deal
If that’s life, then nigga, how is it real?
These last couple of days I've been speaking to my peers
Giving them cries for help, I guess they need to see the tears
But wait, wildest part of all of that is
They'll shoot a suicidal rapper right here on the bridge
But fuck it, gotta pardon 'em, shout out to my squad and 'em
House Gang, Shady, I'm gone, nigga, my job is done
[Verse 3: Yelawolf]
Yelawolf, Gadsden, Alabama
My name is Wayne, I'm from Alabama
Here's the back story:
I just fell off the turnip truck with Ernest Tubb
I'm 33, I've got 3 kids and I just popped 3 pills
I don't know which one's which or what it's for
Safety ain't really a habit I've formed
I still smoke to the cigarette butt
I still drink till I end up being that klutz
Clumsy, self-destructive dummy
Stumbling over my words, mumbling
I'll probably do it tonight
Leave the bar, leave the car
And pass out like a fetus in a jar with my feet up to the stars
And dream about that light that leads up to the lord
I have nightmares about my momma getting beat up in the yard
Wake up feeling like half a human
Hit the studio and unleash this guilt and regret
For my lack of union between rap, you and the rock and roll community
But unity between country music and MCs, I'm claiming immunity
Still I'm working, sawing, milling this tree
Building this house exactly the way Charlemagne tha god and Lord Jamar thought it would be
Wait a minute... the lord and the god hate me
Jesus Christ, I am the white devil!
Nah...
I'm still working, sawing, milling this tree
Building this house exactly the way I thought it should be
Wanna take a tour? Let's see
I've got floor-to-ceiling windows and a cabin-style mansion
Bucks, bears, trucks, boats, tires, spares, four-wheelers
Three-wheelers, two-wheelers, a drug dealer on call
Plaques on the wall, racks on the wall for my guns on the wall
Lift kits, low riders, chop shops, hi tops, low tops, cowboy boots
Dixie flags, American flags, Slumerican tags on my Slumerican ass
CEO
I've got my name on the bathrobe, and the flame on the back porch is lit
Guess who's coming to dinner?
André 3000 and Hank the Third, go figure
I've got two stand-up jetskis, a top pedigree horse, just to pet and feed of course
Who rides a horse in Nashville? I might
I've got bicycles for the kids, tricycles for the babies
M-80s, bottle rockets, bottles in my pocket
Moonshine, gold watches, gold rings
All fake, no bling, don't hate, that's my thing
I've got new clothes, old clothes, vintage, tremendous, endless style
Goodwill loves me Mackle-more than you
I've got flat screen TVs, with skate videos on repeat
All the latest CDs, mp3s, and Beats by Dre
Thank you very much, Jimmy Iovine for the check
I've got a black woman fine as she can be
FeFe with a ring on her finger that could give sight to the blind
A 5, a 10, a couple hundreds layin' on the counter
I don't know where that came from
I got artwork from hard work, yardworkers for yard work
Don't look under the tarp, sir
I'm growin' weed for my mama there
I've got a paved driveway and photos in the hallway of me on my Harley
And I did it my way
See, hip-hop is what you make of it
And I'm makin' a lot of it
See that's a quadruple entendre, Jay Z eat your heart out
[Verse 4: Joell Ortiz]
Joell Ortiz, Brooklyn, New York
But these cyphers?
I treat 'em like they a war; don't want no mediators
Nah, this that grow up in the P's behavior, next door to the greasy neighbors
People thank you, I do this for all the mean creators
I was someone who never needed favors to get where I'm at
Now they deem me a savior
But to be honest I ain't feelin' like that, man I just really like rap
Y'all lucky, trust me
I'm opposite the hands of Sandusky
With the shit that my pen state, these rappers can't touch me
Ugly? Shit, you serious? I'm hideous
I was better than all you silly kids while trying to figure out just who I really is
As a younger dude, life was somethin' rude
I barely made it to the first like a Cutler move
No rubber groove on my shoes led to fights, so suspensions
I had 3 in one week, yeah that was public school
Did I say 3 in 1? That's funny 'cause there's 4 of us in the Slaughter
That's a 3 and 1, I learned that in public school too
Like what's in between a 3 and 1 and House Gang, I spoke to all 3 on 1 call
Like I dropped 2 albums and #3 is 1 second from bein' done
Just need y'all 3 to send me 1 verse apiece
For this Heatmakerz beat and Brother's Keeper 1
Simple mathematics, I'm addin' up to all these rap addicts
I don't like to divide dough so I multiply flow
And subtract maggots
Like a brand new Craftmatic, boy I'm back at it
Smokin' these new boys like my last habit
Dabnabbit I tried to quit but everything I kick's like the last dragon
Hoes suckin' my drummer dick, they on my bandwagon
I just gotta laugh 'cause y'all pushin' a lot of swag
I'm pushin' this big ole Hearse, don't get body bagged

[Verse 5: Royce Da 5'9""]
Royce Da 5'9"", Detroit, gah
These new rappers be askin' me
Why I don't be hangin' out where they be hangin' out
I tell 'em, I say, ""Lil nigga, listen here;""
If I don't got no business there, I don't got no business there
See there's a difference here
You hustlin' so you can be seen
Nigga I'm grindin' so I can disappear
I don't do it like other rappers do
When it's on time, it's skull and bone signs at the stu
We got guns you only find on your cheat code screen
If you think I remind you of any of these niggas you wildin' out
Like Chico Bean
When there's drama I don't ask no questions, I just clap in that direction
I look at this gat like it's a actual accessory
I'm anti-social so relax when you step to me
Nigga I shoot the breeze with actual weaponry
Your lil' stare downs won't fare well
I got a pale conscience, I'm the grey area
The last person I had a bond with was a bail bondsman
Now imagine me hangin' with y'all and we rappin' on the same song
Nigga I'd rather juggle a couple of chainsaws
Or run through hell with a pair of gasoline Hanes on
I'm a star but not on some I wanna be a star kinda shit
The only celebrity who give a fuck less than me is Marshawn Lynch
Glock in the stash as a backup but the MAC'll burst
Cripple your style, your first born child'll come out
With a colostomy bag as the afterbirth
I don't give a fuck
Nigga I'll show up to Beyonce's show posin' as Jay Z
Stagger in your studio session with a bomb strapped to my chest
Lookin' like Omarion holdin' his baby
Jump in the 4 door Mercedes with a .44 listenin' to JoJo and K-Ci
Drinkin' and sniffin' enough blow that it got me thinkin' I can exchange sicknesses
Maybe, this ebola for rabies
That's it, just livin' the rapper life
Banana clip in the air, lookin' like it's 'bout to start singin' it's MAC tonight
MACs, I use this MAC as a component for thugs rollin' up
I got this MAC on and you better stay in that corner
'Cause shit can turn into that song except I don't give a fuck what day it is
I'll have this club goin' up, fuck with me
Mack magnet, attractin' enormous green
Slap this clip in this gat then call this arm Christy Mack
'Cause this bitch is that war machine
Life of a giant, but who needs size when you're wack and your team's soft
Drag your girl down this hill 'til she admits that it feels like she's jackin' the beanstalk
We both got marketing plans
Yours is to sell records and try to net more than you gross before
Mine is to punch you in your face if you ever disrespect me
And then go and invest into a grocery store
Rolled up with the Smith & Wesson and drew on you like let's fight now
I do numbers, I turn you and your crew into two plumbers
Translation, get your shit together and pipe down
Fuck a mic, I don't write, I chew and spit
I'll shoot you and your sis if you insist
I got my eyes on the sparrow
Silencer's so big it look like I got Bobby Shmurda tied to the front of the barrel
And he doin' this
[Verse 6: Eminem]
My name is Marshall, I'm reppin' that motherfuckin' Motor City, bitch
I just turned Slaughterhouse to a quintet
Began to trend-set, murdered a friend's pet
Made shit as ill as it can get went in-depth
Like a fucking vignette and two bars skins wet
I'm already covered in sweat and I wasn't even ready to come in yet
AHH, let me set this drink down
Beat up a gal, start beef with her pal
Probably be wild 'til I'm wrinkled and senile
And ""Rap God"" was a freestyle
Off the top of the dome piece while I was 'sleep on the couch
And I'm freestyling now
I need a towel, sweat leaks from my brow
It's burning my eyes, my cerebral is foul
'Cause shit I'm thinking about should be illegal
I need my head banned like the guy who left Cleveland Ohio
And went to South Beach with his talents
Scream ""fuck you"" on the way out and wink with a smile
This whole game can eat a dick, I'm going back deep underground
But right now I'm back on that bullshit and you I'm singling out
'Cause you're so fucking outdated you should mingle a while
What the fuck is this Klusterfuk of busters?
Bunch of Buster Douglas', motherfuckers is one hit wonders
One swing and you're crowned
Knocked one out the park, one catchy jingle and now
You think you fucking with me 'cause you sold like 300 thou?
Bitch, I can jump without my feet ever leaving the ground
Reach up, swing from a cloud with 3 thousand people around
Evil and vile enough to leap in the crowd
And heave a child in a sinkhole on Cinco de Mayo
When I'm sprinkled in pico de gallo
Mardi Gras beads in a towel
I just made that up
I don't know much Spanish, I'm not bilingual
But I'll show you a Mexican stand off
Between just these two amigos
'Cause neither really wants to say what we're thinking out loud
But I sure as fuck think I know how to read body English, no doubt
'Cause we're trying to kill each other, but lyrically
The fuck is humility? What is a real emcee?
Royce, he came up in this shit with me
Never spit that hustler shit, it wasn't a fit for me
Let them adjust 'til they just get the gist of me
Just not giving a fuck and plus with the history
Of muscular distrophy, it wasn't a mystery
Why this middle finger was stuck in this upward positioning
So what in the fuck is a list to me?
I'm used to not being on it, I expect it out 'em
Heck wit' 'em, I get my respect without 'em
Ain't really been into diamonds since I put my first record out
But I could put a chain around my second album
And wear it as a neck medallion
Became a millionaire, went downhill from there
Became civil, office swivel chair, sterling silverware
Screaming life is still unfair til I get a real career
The fuck am I gonna do until then? This job is too fulfilling
Two ga-jillion pairs of super villain shoes to fill in
A mood to kill till I plow my Coupe de Ville
Into some children at the food pavilion at Build-A-Bear
Warrior's mind, I’m pro-hydrocodone euphoria
In the Drug Emporium line, I'm soaring
I'm pouring Vicodin four at a time ignoring the warning signs on 'em 'fore I go four wheeler riding
Gory and violent, horrifying
You surely won't find no one more abhorring
Than I am with this retaliatory of rhyming for Gloria Steinem
But I finger her like a witness, show me a line-up
I usually am abusive, but excuse me, ma'am
I guess I must've threw you for a loop like Toucan Sam
When I said I could use the sample 'cause you's a tramp
But look how you react to this trigger like
When I call you a bigger dyke than the Hoover Dam
You're playing right into Lex Luthor's hand
It's such a ruthless plan, might even lose a fan
But fuck it, Superman wouldn't change in a phone booth for Stan
I'm a brand new being like Grand Puba's band
Happy as Anderson Cooper having a tuba crammed
In his pooper with lubricant...wait, that's too... I can't
Since honesty is the best policy I'll give you the old college try
Try to acknowledge my mistakes, probably won't qualify
As a gentleman and a scholar, but it's time that I swallow pride
And say that I'm sorry, sorry I can't apologize
I think of all them times I compromised my bottom lines
And thought of rhymes that sodomized your daughter's minds
Then I'm like dollar signs
But I may fight for gay rights especially if they dyke
Is more of a knockout than Janay Rice
Play nice, bitch, I'll punch Lana Del Rey right
In the face twice like Ray Rice in broad daylight
In plain sight of the elevator surveillance
Til her head is banged on the railing
Then celebrate with the Ravens
Never date an assailant who self-medicates with inhalants
I'd meditate, but I may need a better way to escape
The aggression, rage and the anger
Cause leg restraints on the ankles
Heavy weights and an anchor with handcuffs in chains
Just ain't enough to contain it
But I'd still get the same respect as Jay if I came on
Stage in a fucking negligée everyday and Liz Claiborne
Devastated from breakup with Kate Hudson
Wait slut, your friends, what are they gonna say
'Cause makeup ain't gonna cover
That eye that's seven-eighths of the way shut
Peppersprayed with your face cut
Made my bank like a lay up
Off these effing skanks on the way up
Oh, bitch thinks she's heaven-sent
It's evident that she ain't never been with seven inches
Yes, I said seven, I measured it
Seven inches from the floor
While I'm standing on the fourth floor balcony
At the Sheraton while I'm stretching it
Bitch, I'm a pimp so a limp dick is all you'll ever get
So if she's hesitant to get the hint
I'll bet you that I get the message sent who she's messing with
Hella quick when I tell a chick not to ever use sex as a weapon
When I step in and beat the wretched wench with a crescent wrench
Existential detriment to a lesbian devil
And the unpleasant stench of an estrogen level
A separatist like a Chechnian rebel
Impressionist with a pencil
A pessimist, with his lips pressed against
The edge of this Red Bull
Pedal to the metal I'm rippin' this shit cause right away I'll give it to a bitch like a pedestrian, deadly as ever
You see what kind of effects she has on the opposite sex when I push her flexible little sexy ass through a plate of plexiglass
SHADYXV as perplexing as
The last fifteen years and I'm predicting my next relapse
When I spit these lyrics so don't look at me weird
When I start shifting gears and shit re-smears all over Britney Spears
And these little Disney queers
Who use chicks for beards?
Just made that up too...
Oh and the Shady 2.0
We wrote it in roman numerals like they do for the Super Bowls
'Cause it's supposed to confuse you hoes
So flows lose you as usual, so juvenile
2 year old when I go to the studio
It's only music but don't be foolish though
You don't know me through it ho but you can blow me to it though
In my homie's Buick
Been known to lose it though so if I overdo it you drove me to it
When I step in the vocal booth like I'm supposed to do
And murder you on a fuckin' track like Tony Stewart
In one take, if I fuck up and I don't redo it
You couldn't sound grown on a beat if you were moaning to it
The day I don't say fuck you (w)all, you can throw me through it
Rootinest-tootinest, shootin' this from the hip
With the sentiments, Eminem isn't penning them for the women
I'm an enemy to them and the epitome of an inconsiderate idiot
But they consider me equivalent to chlamydia
They tryna get rid of me gadzooks
But I stiggity stand for the figgity flag
Of the United States and the freedom, I distribute these raps through
And if I catch you doing anything
Hindering or prohibiting that after I get me the
Tattoo of your lips on my ass I'ma be literally
Pickin' up and deliberately whippin' the Statue of Liberty at you, woooh!
Fuck it
Got it somewhere in there probably, I don't know142Embed"

Stephen the King
Open a book and I live in a shoe 'cause I ride like Christine
Trill black teen
Killing the [?], witnesses leaving the scene
I'm running with men and the Gods and the Kings
Aquarius'Killa the murder-machine
Bam-bam-bam when I'm cocking the beam
Plus a lot that I spent on that lean
Word, leaving this shit in the dirt after he came from a church
Riding a hearse, Curry the Killer, the curse, putting my dick in her skirt
Making her squirt 'cause she love it, polite, LeToya Luckett
Sing on my dick then I kick her like a bucket
But Raider ain't dying, Killer Curry keep 'em crying
Cry me a river, then drag them to the river
Then I make them quiver shiver, that nigga make them quiver, cold
And Denzel Curry, I'm in my motherfucking mode

[Chorus: Speak]
Yo, how many bitches do you got inside the hatchback? ('Back)
How much money can you stuff inside a knapsack? (Sack)
I need a couple Happy Meals and a lapdance
Shit, I ain't hard to please (Please)
What kind of gun do you hide inside your shoebox? ('Box)
Do you still hide money in your tube socks? (Socks)
You ever lick a few shots at a new cop? (Blaow, blaow, blaow)
Shit, now bring 'em up to speed (Blaow, blaow)

No more Xannies, bitch, there's just a cup of alcohol
Mix it with some juicy juice and take that shit with Adderall
Sip the shake until my liver breaks, fuck her in her little face
And afterwards, I take all of the shit she makes
There's cocaine on her dinner plate
She snorts until her motherfucking vision pixelates
Ask the bitch if she wanted a giant dick to taste
And when she says yes I'll beat that pussy till it fucking breaks
I come in this bitch, likin' the pussy I'm lickin' on, fuckin' and rubbing the clit
Don't give a fuck or a shit, Raider the klan you know that we running this shit
Triple the six, meant it to sell at VA, now it's at 90 to 6
Spitting this shit like I come with a lisp, truthfully, bitches just cum on the big dick
And it's all in her lips
Enough of this shit let's go back to the crib
Came in the crib with a couple of clips
Close on my left there's a gun on my hip
Swag and I'm running a bitch
Hotter than a fucking brick
Off timing, fuck a rhyme scheme, I'm just grinding

[Chorus: Speak]
Yo, how many bitches do you got inside the hatchback? ('Back)
How much money can you stuff inside a knapsack? (Sack)

Livin' like a heathen, smokin' on Garden of Eden
The question I'm always thinkin' is ""What a nigga believe in?""
The only thing I know is that I'm twenty-five breathin'
Fuck a twenty-five to life, deep in my heart, my people need me
It's not for social medias or guest spots on the TV
No Jimmy Kimmel or Fallon, not for the bucks, no Tim Allen
I'm givin' flows out the gallon and leavin' you for a thought
Niggas turnin' down property for a chain that they bought, bitch
Invest in guns when police pull us over
Never stay sick when the climate get grosser
Keep your friеnds close and your enemiеs closer
Government keepin' tabs, put your life in a folder
Many snakes in the grass, so beware of the cobra
Your only option, go to college or be a soldier
Can't even stand your ground when you outside of Florida
Twenty-five years, I'ma call it first quarter

Red eye
Red beams so it seems that a brother gotta terminate
Seen out the streets so we purge the gate
Stay high as a terrorists murder rate
Stay fly as a maggot in early stage
In the grave but it's too late for life
Early for wrong but it's too late for right
Riding an eleven, but it might be your life
You would not know cause you're never inside
Side of my mind, might blow up my mind
Left in a box that was quite in it's lines
Capital lies, I do not have a favorite government because they capitalise
I cannot die
Rolling the dime for the dynasty better now pay for your life
Death *Gunshots*
Way before had dishonor had his Madonna in the sauna
When that Glock burst you a goner
We are the future Jon Connor
Anaconda
Boa constrictor situations getting sticky
I am yet illuminated
Gas in the crib just like its fumigated
Smoked out, with the fam
Fuck the friend cause we're not related
The most heard, or the most hated
I'm the only motherfucker that's fueled by hatred
I'm a demon to you fuckboys cause even the Devil was God's creation

Brush my teeth now it's time to parlé (I'm out)
I call up B Money to open the crystal
It's time to go jet so I skate (open the door, nigga)
I'm rolling and blousing and coughing these ounces
These money roll a whole 28
Took 8 grams
Bumping 99' jams reminiscing on the town last week
Talk about a cop cherry tops run a block
In a Baja saying the youngin' had heat
Spur of the moment
The youngin' was dumb as he dropped from a fatal attack
On the 207 called 9-11
Hit 15 bullets to his back
Shit got whack
Everybody really on that but you just got to embrace it
Even on the tracks just like it's braces
Murder Gardens, Carol City unsolved cases
Face it, you get wasted like it's GTA
But this ain't no Grove Street and you ain't CJ, nigga

I'm the flyest kid ever, like straight out of Con Air
Don't flare 'cause the next man might need a spare
It's not a joke, bitch
I don't shoot, I make tricks, my words too real for fake shit
Five hundred all in the same chain
And they like ""What the hell?"" at the show, House of Pain
And I'm not [bustin' spikеs?] but I'm on a manic train
And y'all niggas need to stop, put you to sleep like Mr. Spock
And this the entеrprise, why y'all lookin' at the sky?
I must be the truth 'cause y'all paralyzed
I am the king looking for a queen
This is self-attested just like the thing
This is like a movie 'til it stepped on the scene
There ain't no whips when I'm lookin' for the cream
With a AK-47 so test my regime
Don't mess with me 'cause I'm a murderous machine
I flow like a sailor, and I beep like a pager
I hang with little West but I wouldn't fuck with Taylor
Not even with two fingers
Mystical, I'm in danger, seeing colors like the Power Rangers

You don't know me but you'd like to
Why'd you think I stood beside you?
Not concerned with how this might fall
Nature become prowl at nightfall

[The Grouch]
When the sun begins to dim
And eventually the day dies
And the mood prepares to sway
That's where another way lies
Glow of the liquor store lights
Set the scene for no rights
Let's convene, discuss the scheme
And hope it flows how we dream
Tonight can make or break you if you let it
Someone set it out for you to let it out
Now don't regret it
Get embedded to the back drop
Positioned there with your cash crop
Envision night as the last stop
Don't miss the train
It's time to gain, strain, aim, fire
Blame, reign, fuck and then retire
I'm liar past eleven, after one I'm on the run
Till the sun comes up tomorrow
I'm working, you're having fun
Not too devious, but that's me
Spontaneous if you ask me
But then again, I'm blending in

Dusk, thus the beginning is on until dawn
Trust regardless of the daily
Really nothings wrong
I'm still breathin' and here's another evening
From the fortress
I leave for my course of tonight's achievements
There's no grievance in my pocket
Just a couple of dollars, a pen and hopefully my wallet
Because my man over here has got the hook up at the front door
Long as my ID's right what more could they want for?
Yeah we in there
Like fluoride, off the wall on the left side
A room full of pride, I'm consumed by the tune applied
This fuckin' DJ is tight man
I can already feel the minutes being added to my life span
MC Lyte paper thin drink tickets from the staff
Now it's time to make a friend and see if I can make her laugh
Hey princess, I got a lot of dialog
So I'm gonna line it up for you to get high and try to follow
Light up another false sense of security
Play a game of twenty questions
You can test my purity
And as the world comes down on me
And as I go down on her... night prowler
[Luckyiam.PSC]
I'm out when the freaks come out
Way after dusk
After the time when the opening acts get they time to bust
The nightshift I prowl and observe like the owl
Surroundings minus the scowl
Wise and well endowed
In the mental! Well renowned
Ghetto pass every town
PSC! Nice 2 meet you, oh you know about this wow!
Your ex-boyfriend showed you all about this how?
Can I thank him for training such a beauty
It fits my style
Compliments exchanged
Plus 5 dollars change
Signed my name on the poster
And I kept it in the holster like I'm supposed ta
Now, what would you do in the clutch
If you get a pussy hug after dusk?

Blood-stained katanas, Black man from Ghana
I battle over my honor and guided by Nobunaga
The power in every kata has channeled most of my Oni
Years later, ended up scarred, broken and lonely
The sword I touch been cursed by memories of war
Every stroke from the blade left the enemies floored
Challenge the lord who could afford to buy your life, clearly
Let you commit seppuku, not worthy of hara-kiri
Forty-five, battle-side, get ready to die
Over pride, commit suicide, standin' right behind
With the steel, noble samurai to the naked eye
I'll decide if you stay alive, hear my battle cry, motherf—

Raider Klan, strictly for my Raiders
A life in the day as Denzel Curry

[Verse]
Okay, it's five in the morning, crack of the dawn and I'm yawning
As I just reminisce when me and my cousin used to roll a swish
Pussy-ass niggas they act like a bitch, they say I wasn't gon' be shit
'Cause the words I choose to use was just so damn articulate
I paint a picture with the scripture my father gave me
Went to yelling niggas and bitches and how you wouldn't play me
But after my granny passed that's when a nigga grew heartless
Run up in the nigga house and shoot the shit like target
Get it? With a pen and a pad and I was quick with it
Laying down on the back end so me and my niggas could rip it
But by then, we broke up, reality hit and I woke up
Each and every day, I take a smoke and I would choke up
Now it's over, I keep a conscious mind ever since I went sober
Stopped speaking of happy times, I wasn't in Range Rovers
A few months later I had a chat with Dece
Yeah, Mike Dece, a real Posh OG
Talking about this rapper that came out the CC
Carol City's own folk, yeah, I'm from the Zone 3
Simmie, well Andrew straight out of Myrtle Grove
Came a fan to a friend, Raider Klan across the globe
People raising eyebrows, think my songs is devilish
Know it's quite rebelish, plus my talent's Heaven-sent, ferno
Creeping with the flame so they can burn dro
Or probably in the Jaguar, bumping while they ride slow
Now listen, no need for the hating niggas
Wasn't here before but then arrived so you a fake nigga
Now my Facebook and Twitter's full of compliments
They scream Aquarius'Killa, now triumphant, then accomplishments

Got apes with a case for banana clips sitting by the money on the safe
But I will bless them, like I been sneezing
I’m sick with the lyrics, my season they season
Your season is food, beef I will cleave it
The love that they showing been broken like Cleveland
I went from a Wolf to a Cavalier
Now my name ring bells through the stratosphere
Over here where the Crips and the Bloods be
Be the place where the boy grew lovely
Now we off free Henny with the bubbly
But don’t touch that bottle my nigga trust me
That’s Patrón and I be blowin on strong
Cause a nigga still stressed cause real shit going on
Like why are my people dying?
Why are those bullets still flying?
They just killed my nigga Spazz
So I spazzed the flow like water Poseidon
To unslave your mind for real
I don’t do it for the money never do it for thrills
I really tryna put on for all my niggas who down
My niggas who would paint a nigga all red like clowns
My pack by the pound, they pack for the sound
Then I flip a verse, move swift through your town
Hit up Curry then it’s back to the Crowne

Titty soft, it be a holocaust for the Häagen-Dazs

Got two guns, two pacs, that's Afeni

Don't believe me? I administer the minister
9 milli' is the finisher, death is your visitor
Told the driver that the time was now, so let's be ready
Bust it like confetti, leave a nigga noodle, no spaghetti
On the street, I let 'em know the SZN don't play, dog
Couple weeks later he was found with a stray dog—
Eatin' out his brain, left a couple remains
A couple of maggots on his chain with his face on the grain
See police they tried to figure out the motive or aim
Then they go back to the hood and try to figure a name
Where was who when the what happened?
Where was you, in the what caption?
Good cop but he's bad acting, bad cop but a good partner
One step got too close, two steps and you're back farther
Back to square one, honey got her hair done
At the salon with bitches talking 'bout Solange
I told her I'ma go undercover just like I'm Bond, James
Look for the shooter just like Lebron James
Had to be careful, I switch the hairdo
One false move and I'll be staring down the barrel
Three suspects dressed in all black apparel
They got on the scene, got away clean, so sterile
I got the analysis when I got a couple hints
The mastermind behind it all, he ruled with a iron fist
Address him as the Lord, a.k.a LoRd Lu C N
The brother on the side of him, he always has a grin

My word is law, forevеr stick to the code
Stay bold and to switch it up when things grow old
All I have in this world is my heart and my soul
Lay my life down for it 'cause they both made of gold
Twenty-four karats, twenty-five and countin', twenty-four hours
Days not promised, but for now, never send flowers

[Chorus: Bridget Perez]
I'm getting tired of the bullshit
Can't keep spinning
Angels keep singing, guide me through all this
Angels keep singing, angels keep singing

[Verse 2: Denzel Curry]
I spent my whole life lookin' for validation
In today's age, it would've led to my cancellation
Damnation for those the good book opposes
Life goes to shit, thinkin' I smelled roses
Friends turn to foes and foes end up frozen
Actin' like my day ones, nigga, you're just posin'
Niggas gettin' coked up and act like they slick
Smile in my face, then go and pillow talk to a bitch
Word got back to me, so it is what it is
I don't fuck with no man who don't take care of his kids
Off-topic, out of pocket, all these niggas is trash
Fightin' for crumbs of fame and some thot with an ass, fuck 'em
Plan, plot, strategize, it's the task, I realize, right before I bomb first
You don't gotta love me, respect me, and fear me
And yes, you gotta fade me if worst come to worst
'Cause love could get you killed, playin' the victim get you bullied
I passed God's test, understood life fully
The wing-ridden angel, the horn-hidden demon
The day I go to war, this is the song I be singin'
The song I be singin'

Play me out y'all
Keep it goin'

I spent my whole career lookin' for validation
Chasin' women that use pussy for they persuasion
Chained to my vessel, saw freedom in meditation
Usin' medication would make the perfect escapist
They unprestigious, I got angels in my allegiance
My demons would look for sin like junkies feelin' fiendish
The meanest streets I walk in, these size elevens I stalk
Not carin' if I'm rich or if I'm surrounded by chalk
I could either live like Jay or die like Jah
Alhamdulillah, let Jеhovah judge me on my flaws
My word is law, forevеr stick to the code
Stay bold and to switch it up when things grow old
All I have in this world is my heart and my soul
Lay my life down for it 'cause they both made of gold
Twenty-four karats, twenty-five and countin', twenty-four hours
Days not promised, but for now, never send flowers

I'm growing tired of the bullshit

Angels keep singing, gotta get through all this
Angels keep singing, angels keep singing

It is the ultimate Myrmidon
From the land, which is the city of Babylon
Dreads in my hairs, don’t confuse me for Cinnamon
I'm one of a kind, as I grow like a Digimon
When I'm evolving, not many books
Many revolvers, no problem solving
Illegal tendencies, infinite symphonies
Illustrate misery, living on infamy
Infamous Lord
If you come back from the dead, you will go back to the morgue
I'll hunt you like Sun Tzu, so better be humble
Don't make me, I'm Wesley in the Art of War

Black M,Back in the Dayz,"9 ContributorsBack in the Dayz Lyrics(Hook: Rellhoe)
I been thinkin' bout them good ol' days
When I was a whipper snapper
Used to try to get a kiss
But now it be the draws I'm after
I'm just a southernplayalistic pimp
I used to sling a fat rock
But now I'm serving Hemp Nigga
I been thinkin' bout them good ol' days
When I was a whipper snapper
Used to try to get a kiss
But now it be the draws I'm after
I'm just a southernplayalistic pimp
I used to sling a fat rock
But now I'm serving Hemp Nigga

( Verse 1: Nell)
Stepped on the block
Everything is still the same
But Niggas changing by the clock
Its just a new day
Matching two J's
John J say he got the dropp
And we copp
Kickin' it on the weekend
Keepin up in the clouds
Wondering why my niggas hanging by the block
But it ain't like back then
Cause its different when your niggas missin'
Niggas be keepin they distance
But we aimin for the cop
As we stroll down the road
That we been chose
Niggas ten toes'in
As we exposing
The niggas fakin' the phonk
So the nigga trunk music
Getting in to it
I buss you head when bump

Fuck bein' a rapper, I'm a snapper and a lyricist

Lumberjack shit 'cause your bitch is on my wood (Woo)
Yes, I'm runnin' shit like the little engine I could
And my city's like a jacket 'cause I stay in the hood (Damn)
Seriously Funny like my name was Kevin Hart
I'm here to take it back like my name was Rosa Parks (Get 'em)

Makin' rappers breakfast like a fuckin' Pop-Tart (Woo)
Tell me, what's the difference 'tween a coward and a hero?
The coward tells a story and so ends the glory
You put it on yourself when you claim that you flashin'
Transporter shit, layin' it down, it's just action
Every beat I get I'm 'bout to turn into a classic
Like Family Guy, I'ma have niggas laughin'
Punchlines crazy and they need a straight jacket (Mm)
Most niggas is [?], most niggas is [?]
Relax and take notes from the words that I spoke
The words that I speak, different mode, I'm a beast (Woo)
Nah, I ain't done 'til the fat lady sings
Nah, I ain't Frodo but I'm Lord of the Ring

[Verse 1: Denzel Curry]
Inside this paper plane
Note my words are Navy sealed so here and I quote
Taboo and I are in the same boat
What's said from Pennywise, I guess we all float
Sky is the limit, I could die in a minute
Got my mind in a skillet, suicide not a mission
See the vibe very timid, I'm timid and very sad
Translated my thoughts and feelings, I pivot into the pad
Rapers turn to landscapers when they use hoes
Hoes turn to housewives when they see gold
Ice Cube with activator when I'm aggravated
Or decapitated when I lose my head since life is overrated
Two thousand feet, a thousand steps
I let it all sink to one thousand depths
Soon black balloons pop
Let it be the day the pain stop

Heaven or Hell, huh, which one prevails, huh?
We gotta go and figure it out
I tried to tell you that this life isn't it
And I just wanna be the rightest I can be
Show my son to think so he can fly as high can be
Always show examples how they kill niggas like me
Thinking as straight as me, but call me crazy
Sun is my attitude, so I'm cool like JAY-Z
Ándale, ándale, my intelligence for threes
Cancel me like I ain't the King of D.C
Cancel me like I ain't the number one G
Cancel me like you don't like ""Dance On Me""
Quickly they forget how you change on all these lies
You flashing all these lights, and you savin' these kids lives
And they hate you 'cause you're right, give me hell then, shit
Take your turn to fire and to pitchfork, bitch

Over my
Tonight on 102.1, it's Denny Cascade and the gang in town
Denzel, are you really making an album?
I'm telling you, eventually, they're gonna catch up to your game, you're running out of time!
Someone is really trying to hurt me!
It's not enough is it? It's not enough you had us come out here
In the middle of the night
What exactly are you trying to hide, Mr. Curry?Embed"

Black M,Black Balloons Reprise (Instrumental),"6 ContributorsMurda Mook vs. Tay Roc Lyrics[Round 1: Murda Mook]
Ayo, congratulations, Pebbles, you did it
You done jumped in your Uncle Smack lap
You asked what's in his knapsack
He pulled out a box wit' a ribbon, big enough to fit you in it
But you got hope
'Cause conversation of the GOAT...you winnin' most likely gets you in it
It's just wack
The only nigga that had your back, you put a knife in his to get it
You snaked Brizz - don't say you didn't
If that's your man, why you ain't convince him it should be him spittin'?
You done blindsided your own pupil out his vision
But I (eye) ain't trippin'
I bet this the last your stupid ass gon' be jumpin' in his business
No cap, so you don't get none of this shit twisted
This battle? It ain't about who the fuck is the pen wizard
This is for hard-headed slick niggas
And since you wanted Brizz whippin', think Summer Impact again wit' it
These punches gon' hit different
Nigga, you a snake
When you talk and I listen, I don't hear words, I hear hissin'
Sss...the way you and URL set up Brizz? That shit sad
Guess you think your turn next (necks)
This fast'll give me whiplash
You can't be from the trenches, 'cause if you was, you would know this shit math
Once Raw turned into Roc(k), it gotta get bagged
This y'all King of Pop!? Beat It
The whole world saw your bitch ass
All that moonwalkin' on stage shit - you did Bad!
How you gon' tell me I (eye) change, but got the nerve to have on contacts?
But you didn't have the nerve to put on when it was contact!
If you was anywhere next to Raw, you was supposed to lock up when the fire was on max
But you cut wack
We saw Roc(k) in hot water...he ain't come back!
""Another cut, another cut, another cut""
Where the fuck was all that!?
You fitted for this New Era: nigga, you all cap
All that ""Cave Gang shit"", that was all act
When it was live and direct, it was, ""Quiet for the set!""
We saw all that violence in your raps, they props
And the real movie started soon as the actin' stopped
Then, you got caught lyin' in blogs and all that
And y'all fans who overlooked that? Y'all fuckin' up the format
'Cause battle rap ain't supposed to have the kinda fans that ignore that
I don't give a fuck how good you battle!
If you can't be a man, I can't be a fan
All forms of respect you shoulda lost that
Talkin' 'bout, ""I ain't see Mook when niggas was fightin'""
And y'all applaud that
Where the fuck y'all grew up at!?
Dickhead! How the fuck you tryin' the nigga that tell the nigga who set it off that!?
But you know what? You right
You ain't see me in a fight - that's a for sure fact
'Cause we on stage, where the brawl at
You was by the exit playin' the floor mat
Guess you ain't wanna en-door (endure) that
Then the fans ask, ""Well, Mook, ain't you in breach? 'Cause they say it's no-contact in the contract.""
Well, how's that?
When all I did what I'm advised at
I just crossed T and dotted a eye (I) black
I'm a man of little words, Roc: read to find (redefine) that
John Hancock: signature right that'll clarify where the line at!
Then you tried to sell ""I ran after I swung""
Who buyin' that?
First off, how he was gon' know if I ran (Iran) if he got his eye racked (Iraq)!?
And please, don't even think I'm glorifyin' that
'Cause I'm not
Listen, Roc, you ain't in tune wit' the block
Nobody know a dude that you shot!
The only TECs (text) you shoot, they blue wit' the dots
You just a kid that was cool, so you rocked
So whether you knew it or not, I'll lose props for havin' you as a opp!
Porkchop!
Call docs, they examine your body: autops'
Saw him after, he walked right past us - thought not
Ain't seen a sucka haul (Hall) off that fast since cough drops!
(*cough*)
The fuck y'all mean ""Gun Bar King!?""
No, you the fuck not!
I don't wanna hear no heavy metal you blastin'
You a punk, Roc(k)!
We saw you in action, you wasn't active
All them punches you got, and you ain't let one drop
You a faggot!
You wouldn't square up for a jump shot!
Y'all jack a nigga who took a plea, when the plan was to go to trial wit' ya co-de'
Bellhop Roc, ain't help Brizz to pop
I thought Roc(k) was supposed to be solid
How you couldn't even send the block (cinderblock)?
Niggas that stand next to doors will get you knocked
Shit you not, you told Brizz, ""Break a leg"" so he could cripple his stock, before he get too hot
Niggas like Roc? They'll gas you to be loyal
To keep you close 'til they destroy you
Y'all don't know how deep the wicket (wicked) is that'll loom in them (aluminum) when they not for you
I'm at hot water boil
Or get metal rounds, break the coil
I'da saw you at the door ajar, and I'da broke Roc(k) down to the oil
Brizz and his niggas should've caught you and beat the brakes off you
'Cause you a coward
And if you from the street, you already know the time I'm on if that's somethin' I'll call you
Coward!
The reason why your raps tonight ain't gon' stack against this?
'Cause they packed wit' a lotta hypothetically clappin' niggas and mad opinions
My shit is shit people actually witnessed
That's the difference
You Power-trippin'
My fans get the entire picture
But your fans, they need proof
That's why I'm glad everybody got to witness the Tommy turn Ghost...
Heh, you James St. Patrick, Roc: you 'bout to die on your own truth
Nigga, you heard it first
This the GOAT, givin' out that Curry work
You 'bout to get 30'd, prob'ly Jersey wit' the Wave and the rafters
Be worried, Surf
You a bati, boy, and I know what ya makin' (Jamaican) for you to whip a verse
You gettin' burnt
How you don't care bein' (Caribbean) the one always gettin' your chicken jerked!?
The butt of the gun pon Roc top, watch his bomboclaat
The chop, feed this pussy the whole fuckin' stock
Lift him out his fuckin' socks!
100 shots make him helicop'
Lift a faggot off the floor
That blade musta spun a lot
And them bars hit, if you love the shot
Look, double-barrel
A pair'll, leave you in peril
Battlewise, a pair of lies'll (paralyze) legal impair you
That a pair of legal, that's for paralegals to handle
Keep it street, I dare you!
Pair of Eagles underneath my 'pparel!
Before you even get to blink, I'll air you!
Nigga, you a bitch
You gon' forever be a bitch!
And you ain't never gon' forget!
This the Statue of Liberty, Roc: forever gon' be lit!
Fuck them candy bars, nigga! I ain't never gon' be tricked
I don't give a fuck if it's Halloween!
A clown never gon' be It!
Nigga, Eazy!
[Round 1: Tay Roc]
You laid the foundation down...but we built where the fuck we at
Don't give a fuck what you did in the past! You just comin' back
Imagine somebody showin' you where you used to do construction at
Like, ""You see this hundred-story skyscraper? I put cement under that.""
Clown...I know you ain't been around
It's been awhile
It is marble on every floor and elevators in this building now
If URL was really a house or somethin'
The nigga screamin', ""That's LIGHT!"" is the reason the power runnin'
You know how I'm comin'
I'll put you out your misery, nigga
Record deals you used to have? Shit a memory, nigga
You've dropped nothin' hot in history, nigga!
I'd rather be a god-tier battle rapper than a bottom-tier industry ni-
What you supposed to be? Some type of lyrical miracle?
My nigga, you say stupid shit that's hysterical!
You told Lux, ""You are more hypocritical than a dyin' hippopotamus""
TERRIBLE!
That shit was so unable to bear: unbearable
I swear if you, act up, I'mma make it all spooky
One thing you better control is the way you talk to me
I won't play wit' y'all goofies
I am not a PG
I'm somethin' I don't think Murda seen (murder scene): I'm a rated-R movie
When I was Dot Mob, I played my position
I never played you
When everybody turned they back on y'all, I stayed true
I coulda left when K-Shine left, joined DNA too
I left wit' the crew I came in with: my Cave crew
Me not helpin' Brizz...had me stressin'
I was dead wrong for not helpin' Brizz, no exceptions
I learned my lesson
You talkin' 'bout me holdin' doors?
Question...
That door I was holdin' in the fight was backstage
Why ain't you come in that direction?
Pussy!
You speak on me not fightin'? Kinda awkward
You swung and poof...disappeared
You the reason the drama started
You ain't stick around for action
Why you put on this front?
You left Detroit niggas fightin' backstage and...went out the front!
You are not live, you big bitch!
You swung, missed, we got rushed by Detroit niggas
Nobody in Dot Mob did shit!
Bitch, you real bitter
Fuck how you feel, nigga
Who are you to tell anybody that they ain't a real nigga?
Don't worry 'bout me, don't ask me my business
Where were you when Rex got his ass beat on Lenox?
Somebody posted a pic of his eye...yo!
Shit look like he got hit by a Tahoe!
His face swole, nose bust, and his eye closed
It coulda been my fault, he prob'ly was high
I wanna see if you can get this riddle
My Expert Opinion: you shouldn't be having shits and giggles wit' a nigga that pistol-whipped you!
Shit is simple
Nigga split your temple, somethin' dent your mental
Nigga left Murda beat: he killed a instrumental!
You shittin' me!?
Ask this dumb nigga what's wrong wit' him
That nigga split your head open, to the white meat, and then you did a song wit' him!
Aye, that sound like good bargainin'
Y'all want a feature from Mook? Don't pay him
Just pistol-whip him and crack his skull again
You comprehend?
Nigga, you ain't safe unless you walkin' in wit' a bodyguard
Even he gon' need somebody guardin' him
Boy, you are softer than the softener your shit is washin' in
I'll have it to where you passed, your pastor passin' 'round offerings
No arguin'
I'll be like, ""Let's go live on the 'Gram""
Dap you, then slap you: I got bipolar hands
We can't compare resumes, mine's over fam's
I'm the Gun Bar King, I never met a phase (metaphase) where my toast is (mitosis) jammed!
Play wit' me crazy
Tay'll get angry
Rest in Peace, Party Arty: I will have Murda face a P80
Your roof'll get shot, I'll bang a .380
Snoop on your block, murder Murda, and 'Murder Was the Case' that they gave me
You really should stop, or really get shot
Hittin' your top
This inf' red foreheads: it's a Indian dot
Gimme ya Glock! Semis'll pop
They won't know what happened to Mook
Murda (murder) unsolved...rest in peace, Biggie and 'Pac
I had to kill Rex, one round
In Philly, he dropped
Now I'm givin' the General Mills: it's a cereal box!
I might flip
Let this butterfly knife flip, slice shit
187, Method Man wit' the ice pick type shit
Bitch, clamp ya head in a vise grip
Leave him there for 1,400 hours - I know it sound type slick
But on military time, it's type sick!
Forensics found Murda (Murder) at 1600
Who seen that Wesley Snipes flick?
I know the basics
Roc(k) is still active like open cases
Open faces, like Taraji wit' the rifle in Smokin' Aces
I'll leave you in the desert, I will find a hole in Vegas
And that's How to Get Away with Murda (Murder): Viola Davis!
You not the truth
Pussy, you ain't a nigga that I salute
If it's beef, I don't apologize...I cop a deuce
I'll let goblins loose, they don't wanna hear no kinda truce
Rock his roof, his this Cat in the Hat: Dr.-
I got the juice
You thought you was educated?
Boy, you'd put a hit out on Roc and be devastated
Come to find out the hitter you sent to me never made it
He hesitated, when they found Murda's man slaughtered: it was premeditated
You talk stupid, I'mma split this nigga mug
If I'm ever stealin' (steel in) a bar, there's a pistol in the club
My bitch creep up wit' somethin' resemblin' a snub
BANG! That was ""Murda"" (Murder) She Wrote on the window in his blood
Knocked his brains out, murk him wit' a .9
He landed head-first in his brain matter: I put Murda (murder) on his mind!
Boy, you straight twat
Fuckin' wit' Tay Roc? I think not
I'll push a blade in, 'til the blade stop
Twist it
If I can't get it out 'cause the blade locked in his tank top
I drag Hawks 'cross Mookie chest: Blaylock!
He'll straight drop!
This rifle'll hit his head
If whoever got your back alive, it'll be Night of the Living Dead
I'm the nigga that this nigga can't body
I don't care how long you rap
See, Murda (C-Murder)? No Limit can't stop me
Rap
[Round 2: Murda Mook]
Yo, all jokes aside...
When I just listened to you rappin'...choreographin'...'bout how you 'bout to make all of this dyin' happen...
It took every bone in my body to not start dyin' laughin'
Yo, Roc, everything violent that you say gon' happen is not gon' happen
My Detroit niggas already showed you the one be lyin' (Lion), cappin'
But wait a minute, hold up
Y'all hear that?
""Hello! (Hello?...)
Is anybody home? (Is anybody home?...)""
No vacant!
Roc, where everybody in the Cave went?
They escaped to civili-za-tion!
They figured out they ain't gotta stick to Roc(k) to get they flame lit
You tricked them, you ain't train them
All that gas, all them matches, you gave 'em
But they talent set the blazin'
Somehow you made 'em believe friction is how it got created
Now, I know y'all thinkin', ""That's basic information. Where they been?""
But duh! They been livin' under a Roc(k): they was Cave men!
All them skeletons of yours you thought was lost?
Ain't no favoritism pickin' which bone marrow, and I brought 'em all
Push a pawn off a board
I helped you sow your royal oats
That's what I brought you to the city for
So JayBlac, when King Jaffe around Roc, I ain't with none of that semi (Semmi) talk!
You wanna switch roles wit' me? Pause
But it's yours
Fire lead in your hat
Now you King Jaffe, Roc...lyin' (lion) dead on your back!
It ain't where you from, pussy - it's where you at
That's why I came all the way where I'm from to where you at
I dare you at
Tranquilizer leave a bear relaxed
Die wit' ya eyes open - let's have a staring match!
The hammer clap, 'til the handle burn like candle wax
Tre on your hat, you don't even get a Chance to rap
Dead rappin' better promotion, see his fans react
I told Smack, ""I need chicken"", he sent the FAMILY PACK!
If we warrin', then we warrin' then
I'm Balrog, let's brawl again
You will get pressed then stretched like an accordian
Boy, you'll get whip(ped) to next week like the DeLorean
I see they done switched up the playboard for him
Well, whatever offense y'all niggas put Jordan in, I'm scorin' then
Oh, you Jazz-talkin'? Let the vault spin, I'm locked in
Ain't no pick-and-rolls either, Roc
I create my own options like, ""If I see him alone (Malone), give him the whole stock then (Stockton)!""
Niggas say, ""Mook, you hate Roc!""
...Aight, and?
""But hate is a strong word like...what if, God forbid, tomorrow, you find out Tay a goner?""
I say, ""Nigga, that'd be a weight lifted. I wish it was a way I could make it stronger.""
Roc, you gon' respect me, boy
And these foul lines is 'cause I'm tryna make a extra point
I hope you spiritual...not wit' these dark forces you would hit-
Dracula? Nigga, who's scared of you?
Matter fact...if bein' Dracula don't tell y'all he a sucka...
(*under his breath*) Ah, my God...
You can't say it no clearer
How y'all put stake in the heart of a nigga who can't look himself in the mirror!?
Well, let's see if this shit is all a myth
I got a clip full of garlic-dipped hollow-tips
What happen when you swallow this?
Sleep in a casket tight, exactly how you like
I go to your funeral, I talk sarcastic on the mic like, ""He Dracula, right?
Then y'all good - he should be back by tonight.""
Hand of God, straight to Pearly Gates: Smack White
Son raise (Sunrays) ain't dawn on Tay 'til the morning...that's light
I'll hurt the back outta wife
Well, tell that bitch watch her mouth 'fore I gag it shut
Grab her up, let her know she don't be around smack enough
She talk like a Goon, like bullet wounds ain't about jack (Jakk') to her
Well, let's see if she feel like that after she gotta Count Dracula's!
You ain't do it wit' Hustle
Callin' Troy Mitchell your uncle is what gave you credentials
Fuck you thought, biggin' Chess (chest) up was gon' make you official (O'fficial)?
What about them videos of you spreadin' open your asshole you gave to O'fficial?
That's on my mother grave, all of this true - sorry, O'fficial
And them niggas from the Cave found out that shit, too
That's why they ain't wit' you!
Look, you see Brizz ain't on Roc set
You startin' to show distance a lot, Chess
Ave left the Cave - nigga, see what you got left!?
Wait a minute...when A-V-E leave the C-A-V-E, C what you got left
Right, see, you been suckin' Rajon so long, guaranteed you got cock breath
Look, that nigga Surf is sick of you
He been wanted to get rid of you, but he stuck around...typical
Y'all relationship ain't reciprocal
Nigga, Roc the help
Well, I give it true
I'll leave that shit to Tsu to play Mystikal
But yeah, you wanna shake your ass!
You ever watch yourself!?
That nigga Surf talk to you on Live like you are not yourself!
You killin' his business
You got him against a Roc(k) and a hard place
He know you Manolo, but don't got the cojones to play Scarface
Surf, you sound like a goofie!
""But Mookie...Mookie, Roc(k) kept callin'!""
Shut the fuck up!
The only real way you stop fuckin' wit' Roc is with drawin' (withdrawin')
Motherfuckin' right
You a cartoonist
The only guns you drew is the ones you drew so much when they write
You give us illusions, they were startin' to come to life
But...that's right
Batman, Cave Gang
Well, Roc, it ain't the same thing
My gun go ""Bang""
Your gun say ""Bang""
Say, mayne, wait a minute, you takin' this Bat shit too far
Now you want us to believe you can see sound?
That's impossible
Wait, but if that's logical
When I got you and the Wave bouncin' off walls from this TEC echo, locate (echolocate) a hospital
I'mma sit here and play blind wit' you
But Roc, these ain't just lyrics, this shit is Braille
And to make sure you see what I'm sayin', I gotta make you feel it!
Wait, where was your imaginary Dezzi when you was Mario Andretti?
Imposters (im-pastas) want sauce until their legs turn spaghetti
Then the Culture got mad I spoke facts - I wasn't ready
How I get killed for talkin' real? I feel like Dr. Sebi
You 'bout to see the greatest ever milk this game: legen-dairy
Ben & Jerry, said Ben & Jerry's, get hit in flurries
It's gettin' scary, his vision blurry
Tell medics ""Hurry"", dead in his telly
Turn a bed and breakfast to a bed and buried!
I see you been hangin' 'round T-Top a lot!
So what? They all scared
But look, all's fair in warfare
Your boy Bear, he poor bears
Pallbearers done pour beer for poor Bear
I'mma say that shit one more time real slow...so you hear
I said...all's fair in warfare
Your boy Bear, he poor bears
His pallbearers done pour beer for poor Bear
""Aye, Roc on FIRE!""
Piss on that nigga, I don't care!
'Cause this Macho Man ran, he (Randy) Savage all year
Nigga, you a bitch
You gon' forever be a bitch!
And you ain't never gon' forget!
This the Statue of Liberty, Roc: forever gon' be lit!
Fuck them candy bars, nigga! I ain't never gon' be tricked
Give a fuck if it's Halloween!
A clown never gon' be It!
Nigga, EAZY!
...Stupid-ass contacts in your fuckin' eyes
[Round 2: Tay Roc]
Battle rap...would be boring without the grace of me
Whenever I'm not around, y'all be boring 'em, basically
I should fall back a card or two, just to make 'em see
All it takes is one boring card
Soon as some more gets bored (smorgasbord), they'll have a plate for me
Bitch, you can be I'm the alpha: I'm talkin' A to Z
They gon' patiently wait for me while you die painfully
Don't play wit' me
Aye, we all gathered here tonight
Everybody, bow your heads at y'all table and say grace wit' me
God, forgive me - gotta murder Mook 'fore he murder me
Treat this battle like I'm fightin' a murder case purposely
But facin' Murda won't worry me, certainly
I'mma beat Murda (murder), first, second, and third de-
Amen
You heard of me
Roc been here for eternity
This blade for emergency
I'll do a surgery perfectly, cut vertically
Catch ya newborn inside a nursery
Bury him, your seed'll be the first planted (planet): Mercury
Currently, I'm the best, in history
The rest disagree
I'm facin' Murda, but you facin' the death penalty
BANG! I could kill him with less energy
Have somethin' Loaded in front of Mook: this gon' be the best trilogy
Yeah, they say I really be trippin' grippin' this .38
Bang! Make the soul of Murda rise wit' the murder rate
Terminate
This whole place'll be flames if you play Tay
I just wrapped some old tape on the K: Ray J
You know how they say cigs is a gateway drug?
Put a Sig (cig') in your mouth, you'll get drug through a gateway
If niggas ask how I been, then this what I may say
""I'm doin' fine. You seen my last battle? I had a great Da-""
Loyal to this league, I'm grateful
I ain't mad what I'm paid
I been ignorin' all the questions that they had for the Cave
Since they no longer see (C) Ave, it's, ""What's Cave without Ave?
What's Ave without Cave?""
I'm 'bout to have an outrage
This is actually my stage
All the classics I made, all the passion I gave
Even though niggas jumped ship
I could run shit without one nigga on my team on some Donald Trump sh-
You on Trump dick!
Tell 'em that when you go and perform
The way you take up for Trump, it (trumpet) seems like you wanna blow on his horn
I know you a corn!
You easily offend me! I see you buggin'
You got white bitches callin' you ""nigga"" - you ain't even fuckin'
You thought that swing was meanin' somethin'?
You gon' end up like Caine at the end of that movie: I'll lean a (Ilena) cousin
And your bitch better not speak or nothin'!

Yeah, y'all hear me back there! Yeah!

You gon' end up like Caine at the end of that movie: I'll lean a (Ilena) cousin
And your bitch better not speak or nothin'!
She try to get out a sentence? (*smack*) Butt her (butter) in the middle: she a English muffin
Her teeth I'm crunchin'
Sound like she speakin' Russian
I'll reach for somethin', heaters dumpin', people runnin'
Them be the reprecussions
Mook, learn your bitch ass some manners in my castle
What you got...one, two, three, four, five battles?
Nigga, I been there and done that like time travel
I'll clap you, then bury the stainless steel: it's a time capsule
Give MM this .9mm, lean one
Since your initials is M and M (Eminem), I brought a Machine Gun
Clean one, shoestring, and a 'K strapped to it
Money on his head, I'll put a G on MM and make Maybach Music
John Ancrum, you in some shit
Don't act like you innocent
.50 clip, stick wit' a drum: instrument
Pistol-whip, break John face in increments
In other words, I give a fuck what John Ancrum meant
I'm vigilant
I'll break a ligament on this participant!
Take this loss on Caffeine to the heart: stimulant!
You ain't shit to niggas I went against
If URL was a country, you'd be a visitor visitin'
You'd be a immigrant!
I'm ignorant, and not the one you should really get pissed off
I'll get Murda (murder) set up in a small room: Jigsaw
Christian, Louboutin wit' the spikes-

Y'ALL HEAR ME!? Y'ALL HEAR ME!?

I will get Murda (murder) set up in a small room: Jigsaw!
Christian, Louboutin wit' the spikes, I will kick dog!
Spike get him, like that Fatality wit' the pitfall
Gun in your mouth
Boy, I will push until this bitch cough
Have him hoarse (horse) wit' a revolver: McGraw Quick-Draw
This shit about...angles, bars, schemes - pick a route
I'll have you identifyin' your bitch body, you gotta pick her out
At 16, I had the dope game figured out
Moved whole things in and out
Talk like you got cocaine in that drought
Kick in your door, both Tay blikkers out
Lookin' for Murda and (murderin') that white bitch...it ain't at O.J. Simpson's house
I got a surprise
You wanna live? You gotta survive
Pull up on the side of your ride, shotty'll rise
You prob'ly'll die
I'll wet up your ride
That's exactly how I left Murda (murdered) wit' his bitch: Bonnie & Clyde
You gotta be high!
Off-white, you sniff that color
You think it's all lolly? Pop (lollipop) on this big-ass sucker
Big mag-tucker
I lift that, buck you
Headshot, left Murda (murder) in the hood: I Know What You Did Last Summer
You bitch-ass sucka!
You don't know how to be a soldier
I'll have niggas followin' you, and they followin' a quota
Pop the trunk, throw your body in a Rover
Ransom note like the Purge movie:
""We holdin' Murda (murder) for 12 hours, and it's over.""
Stoppin' me? Shit, I would be amazed
I heard when you facin' Murda (murder), it's scary, but I'm not even afraid
This where the shit stop
You gotta see the Cave
Facts of life, only way you can skip Roc(k), you gotta see the Wave
Nigga, if you was in my class, you'd be bottom-tier
Ars' would disrespect you, DNA would get you the fuck outta here
K-Shine will fuck you up...but first, you all mine
'Cause Smack'll look like Puffy if he even attempt Murda (murder) on Shine (Shyne)
You ain't the King of Harlem, you don't know how Loaded you be in
Type of nigga to take a picture wit' Alpo if he see him
You'se a BITCH!
My man Craig ain't search us
We'll make this room rock
Run up stupid and be the next Billy Boondocks
My cannon blam, I'll shoot 'til the hammer jam
I will have Rex tryna wake you up in a ambulance
You don't stand a chance
We could go hand-to-hand, I'm a handyman
I will catch Murda (murder) wit' this hook: Candyman!
I'm the nigga that this nigga can't body!
I don't care how long you rap
See, Murda (C-Murder)? No Limit can't stop me!
Rap, pussy

[Round 3: Murda Mook]
Yo, I ain't gon' lie, all jokes aside...
When I just listened to you rappin'...choreographin'...'bout how you 'bout to make all of this dyin' happen...
It took every bone in my body to not bust out dyin' laughin'
You said this shit is about angles and schemes, a lot of content
But...all you do is kill niggas every round
Other than that, you not sayin' a thing
You know what? Fuck you and your mom's a bitch
Lemme say that shit again
""Fuck you...and your mom's a bitch""
...Oh, that prob'ly don't register, right?
That's 'cause in the physical, your moms exist
Y'all don't remember? ""Say it again!""
It was mainly him egging that shit on wit' Brizz
In hindsight, those sentiments were more yours than his
My mom's a bitch? That wasn't even creative, Roc
No metaphors or flips
The sheer disrespect is why you knew that bar would hit
Losin' any family member hurt - that's common sense
But losin' your mother? That's hard as hard could get
You wake up every morning sick, can't do nothin' more than wish
Your whole reality torn to bits
My mom's a bitch?
Wait a minute - my mother talkin' - sshhh...
She told me to tell you next time, be careful wit' the forces you talkin' against
You ain't notice it's all been downhill for you since
Bein' exposed for this fraud you is
She said to tell you that's karma...that's what you can call a bitch
Thinkin' back to Summer Impact, you would be the nigga to front
But I'm con-few-sed
Didn't you get what you want?
I mean...you was the main one sayin' when I rhyme I need to hurry up and get to the punch
Which one is it, chump? 'Cause now you wastin' my time
Well, maybe a MAC to your head will cause medics (cosmetics) to help make up (makeup) your mind
See the difference in the way that we rhyme!?
I don't just ""Bang! Bang!"" fake make-up wit' lines
My punchlines is real rap
I make metaphors outta real facts
I cover all my ground
But wit' yew? All I found...
...is you talk wild loud...'bout how your gun gon' pow-pow
All your opponents all got pounds
But in the end, them niggas all got pounds
""Yo, what's gon' happen when Roc pick that lead up!?""
Nigga, he gon' jot down
Your straps only seen in your raps
Matter fact, that make you the nigga wit' the drawn-out rounds
This kid is wired
Roc, you done put enough bullet holes on loose-leaf to fill a binder
I gotta peel (pill), but I'm next-level ill
For real, my pen a ceiling (penicillin) higher
Wait a minute, I don't know what's worse...
The fact that a nigga wit' just they bare hands could take your chain...
Or the fact that a nigga wit' just they bare hands could break your chain...
How I could just walk in the middle of the mall and make your chain?
And then you come back to URL wit' a faker chain!
Wait a minute, you paid to get somethin' back that's fugazi!?
You crazy...
Wait, it shoulda been surgery, new body, somethin' from a waist snatch
You couldn't be a bigger ass payin' for somethin' fake back!
I don't fuck wit' battle rappers 'cause y'all think small and I hate that
Arguin' 'bout a million views - I'm tryna get paid that
My pockets Puffy, right!
But wit' you, it's, ""How did he (Diddy) take that?""
You ain't even got a car, Roc! Say that ain't facts!
No, ya don't
You done sold ya soul to so-and-so
Sold your soul to this platform, now you stuck, can't go unless you goin' broke
Hope ya know you're hoin', ho!
Reason my dough load the boat?
'Cause I down the streams, sellin' out row, row, and row
That's currency (current, sea) overflow
Roc, on the low...low...low, low-low-low?
I will put all this shit in motion, ho
But if you think you the wave? Sure (Shore), whatever floats your boat
Look, you can win Twitter polls and votes
But the way I get paid for this shit?
(*to Smack*) Tell 'em niggas: I'm the only GOAT
That's all a fact
You out here sack chasin', can't get a quarter back (quarterback)
Talkin' 'bout ""URL made me""
How? I'm makin' more than Smack!
Nigga, I got paid for three battles
You ain't heard one round yet
I'm gettin' paid to rehearse now: that's what you'd call a sound check!
Do ya hear me now!?
I get a bag, you get a purse...bitch
Big difference in that - very
Your shit be on the arm, my shit I gotta carry!
G'head wit' all that ""Roc-a-Fella""
Roc a fairy!
You play the bitch role!
This comparin' Tyler Perry to watchin' Belly!
You done tricked us into thinkin' you a live (alive) nigga like Makaveli!
The pole don't horseplay
Enough to go 'round, the more the merry
Pause...niggas stripped you wit' no pistol?
I'm disgusted wit' you
Niggas just booked you and left...
The most notorious vampire in the world, you go ruin his rep'
Sad day when Dracula gets somethin' took off his neck!
Then five of y'all go beat on a female
Talkin' 'bout, ""Well, she was the woman who lined him!""
Yeah, but what about the man who robbed him?
That man ain't hidin'
He all on the 'Gram wit' your shit in his hand, postin' addresses on where you can find him
He posted your ID, wit' the same address you share wit' your mama
And that ain't nowhere near the problem
Roc, here's the problem
If that address was somethin' only your close friends and family know...
Wait a minute, let's do the math
Carry the 2, then the fo'...there we go
How the fuck did the tranny know!?
'Cause that was the same address she posted from y'all DMs of you tellin' her where to go
And that was over two years ago
Roc, and there's audio...
I bet you would be corny though and be like, ""W-Well, where it go?""
Right?
I bet you won't get on here wit' Goodz and act like he ain't hear it, though
I'm sorry, Goodz, but Dan Barz is my man, so...
You know what?
I'mma give you line-for-line validation to let you know I had the conversation
Here it go...
""Tay Roc, Tay Roc, I ain't tryna come out there for you to waste my time.""
He go, ""Yo, why you keep sayin' my name so much?""
""What, you tryna shut me up?""
He said, ""No, I'm comin'""
She banged the line
She called back, said, ""I need you to know I'm not a woman.""
You hear him say, ""Huh?""
She said, ""I wasn't born a woman.""
It was a delay, second-wise 'bout eight or nine
And that's on my mother grave, to the sky
The next phrase from this guy was...""Yo, hurry up before I change my mind.""
Say I'm lyin'!
Say I'm lyin'!
Say I'm ly-

[Tay Roc]
You lyin'

[Murda Mook]
Say I'm lyin'!

[Tay Roc]
I said it

[Murda Mook]
Say I'm lyin'!

[Tay Roc]
I said it, nigga

[Murda Mook]
Yeah, yeah, we know
But don't worry

[Tay Roc]
Go 'head, get tight

[Murda Mook]
After this, everybody gon' hear it, bro
But look-
Listen, listen, listen, listen, listen...
Rest in Peace to Brizz bro
In the orange shirt, he had him put in the earth
Real nigga, he never woulda got put in my plot
'Cause see, when it's love...it's no time to think
You just react when you get put in that spot
But here's the nigga who started everything and did nothing
Bein' loyal to him, Brizz, look what it got
God, why you always take the real niggas from us?
It shoulda been Roc!
Nigga, 'cause we know those was all your views
You'se a dummy
Tryna be a ventriloquist and use a dummy to talk for you
Tennis threats on the Internet
I wasn't racketin' back-and-forth wit' you
I wanted to wait, tell you, ""Suck my dick"" in your face!
Now do what you was taught to do
...Exactly!
This nigga play the battlefield, your whole squad soft as you
My niggas wit' pistol play - they prayin' I call a audible
Your niggas give high-fives when they hear gun bars that's hot from you
My niggas shot guys
If they ain't die, they finished inside the hospital, nigga!
Let's call a spade a spade
Right now, I'm battlin' two and a possible: Brizz, T-Top, and you
When you couldn't swim or fend (orphan) for yourself, Dot Mobb adopted you
I got battles locked for you
When that Cave was dark and empty, I went to bat a lot for you
Knowin' I created you, burnin' a hole inside of you
A shot or two is optimal, but I need you livin' long as possible
Make Roc die breathin', that's what I could do
I'm satisfied that you dyin' inside knowin' your career forever tied with Mook
Ain't nobody kick you out
You was Tre, you jumped out the ride for you
'Member?
When your punches wasn't hittin' NOTHIN',
Furious: I was the pop for you
But you only saw it one way
All them gun bars every round done had it's run, 'K?
So I'm telling you this what's best-- GIMME THE MOTHAFUCKIN' GUNS, TAY!
Wait a minute, wait a minute...
WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS SHIT IN HIS EYES?!
They not even prescription man...
So you mean to tell me, a nigga that'll can do all this...
Just to look like that, this is the vibes?
[To Smack] The nigga that's supposed to be the face of battle rap, this is your guy?
You know what I'ma fall back...
Nah, I gotta go and ask:
How you let these niggas fuck up my house this much when I was gone, Smack?
When I left, this shit was raw:
Pissy halls, crack on the floor, nobody door latched
I come back, it's Mr. Bentley: nigga's holdin' doors
Wearin' suit jackets and wearin' colored contacts
Y'all auditioning for these white niggas tellin' y'all how act more black
Now the boss gotta ask his boss that
Bitch, y'all guns can't even be loud no more, they gotta golf clap!
Congrats, they did it guys
Got our whole culture gentrified
Killin' was your own, nigga, that's genocide
Roc, they got your senses fried
You just a rental in their enterprise
They done convinced you winnin' is the prize
Nigga, when you hit the live with them guys, nigga you don't split the pies
Your reward is is being happy you was in the ride!
Nigga, you a bitch
You gon' forever be a bitch!
And you ain't never gon' forget!
This the Statue of Liberty, Roc: forever gon' be lit!
Fuck them candy bars, nigga! I ain't never gon' be tricked
Give a fuck if it's Halloween
A clown never gon' be It!
And just off the sheer fact...he said in his face-off, he wouldn't react to nothin' I said...
See his face when I talk about that tranny shit...and see if he ain't fuckin' with Fred

[Round 3: Tay Roc]
Aiight Mookie
What you gon’ talk about? Fake chain? How I got robbed nigga?
I don’t wanna hear shit about a fake chain in a robbery, from a Dot Mobb nigga
'Cause coming from your bitch-ass mouth, it don’t add up
It happened to me, ‘cause hanging with Rex, is bad luck
Yeah... Yeah, I got robbed, but I can't tell y'all
What's stranger than, your enemy taking a gun and beating you with it, 'till you became his friend
SHAME ON HIM!
Let him try and fight in this match, just like the face-off
I will have candles lit, right where you at
I don't wanna be your friend, SUCK A FAT DICK!
In Fight Klub, you was gettin' yo' ass whipped
You Brad Pitt, Cardi washed you, who said this cat sick?
Gat spit, I'll let a cap off, bomb on ya lip, it's Chap-Stick
I'm THAT sick
Who said I can't hang with you? It's nonsense
Boy, I am on a different page and I got a table of contents
I'm God sent
You and Calicoe formed a team, you ride his DICK
'cause you scared of him
I killed that nigga when I was on yo' team
If I was Shine, me and you, wouldn't speak at all
He link with DNA, y'all kicked him out, that there to me, is fraud
I link with Surf when I was Dott Mobb, y'all ain't say shit to me at all
Y'all known Shine forever, niggas ain't even know me that long
See that's wrong
I'ma let y'all see the rest
It was; me, you, Rex, Shine, you said ""We the best""
I stole that whole blueprint from you, and made my team the best;
Chess, Brizz, YK, Bad Newz, me and Chef
The other pieces left, gon' be hard to move
It was always cool, to have Surf on board, gnarly dude
My squad is goons, that Brizz shit, got dawg confused
Swing on me, my man clutching across the room
I ducked and, sonic BOOM!
You shot in ya voice box
That's what this .38, special effects, autotune
Y'all is doomed
I'm waiting for niggas to start somethin'
I'ma run up, and ask yo' bitch ""You saw somethin'?""
I said ""Axe yo' bitch,"" I really meant cut off somethin'
Blue steel blade, I'll give Babe the Blue Ox, Paul Bunyan
Dawg bluffin, let this nigga start buggin'
I send my hitta, with a shotgun, like Elmer Fudd, and my dawg huntin'
You was duckin' Surf, but I won't involve cousin
You would lose, and you only get Tsu (suit) and tie when you job huntin'
I'ma dog cousin
Show him, how a switchblade, point feel
Head to chin, (*shwoop*) shed his skin like an orange peel
I killed Rex and 'Lyt
You thought it was over? Nigga, It's on still
I gotta bury Murda by the Mobb, now he Nicky in the cornfield
And why Rex, act so tough, but froze up?
Hitman, was gon' pull up on Rex like a tow tru..
You know what? You ain't really catch it
And you don't realise, fuckin' with Dott Mobb, is the only stain on my jacket
You ain't in my bracket, raisin' a ratchet
Bangin' a Smith'n, ancient Egyptian
Boy, I will put Snake in a casket
Don't play with me, faggot
You know what's a silly thing?
You the nigga that tried everything, and really didn't succeed in anything
Mook, you are 24 fluid ounces, you ain't a liter (leader)
I am magic on this stage, I take y'all and I make believers
Burn ya back, no thermostat, when I raise a heater
This shotgun, got different coloured shells, like dyed eggs for Easter
BANG! Lay Murda down with a cold grin
Fuckin' with my money? This ain't No Country for Old Men
I call the gang like ""Circle around, get close in""
I get a green light and they circle around yo' close friends
On Instagram, the niggas you put in yo' close friends
This for Brizz, 'cause when I win, we both win
I'mma smoke him
Kalashnikov, German chopper stick
When I blast off, guess where these bullets from Roc get shipped (Rocket ship)
Ya top get hit, the chopper spit
Scary Movie, bang a sub at the back of ya head, ""I said a dollar, BITCH!""
You got me PISSED!
Taking this loss, ain't gon' sit well
Hockey stick, Harlem nigga, same difference, Big L
I'll have you gettin' balloons and cards that say ""Get Well""
'Cause Murda, ended up, in a ER, ya name is misspelled
BIG SHELLS, my hands'll get on a 40
I'll make a movie in Murda (Murder) house: American Horror Story
What you doin' for me?
Nigga for you, I be mean writin'
Somethin' struck him, out this SK, Why? (Sky) You'll see lightnin'
This DC Universe scheme frightenin'
I'll leave his BITCH, rocked, in the middle of the face, Raven from Teen Titans
I care about just this league (Justice League)
And on SMACK fam, this Joker hardly could win (Harley Quinn) against a Batman
I will run in this cat woman (Catwoman) house, while the oven cooking
Like ""Where the safe? I'll blow out everything that you wonder woman (Wonder Woman)""
Yeah I'm robbin' (Robin), act like a hero, I'll lift and blast
*Tchh Tchh* I will get rid of that swamp thing (Swamp Thing) in a flash (Flash)
Nigga's trash, you really make niggas laugh
Talkin' bout that I'm a little nigga *chuckles* This little nigga will whoop yo ass
Boy, I will knock a fuckin' tooth out ya mouth, leave ya words choppy
I killed Rex and [Day]Lyt, in Dott Mobb, you my third body
I'll turn him to an RIP tattoo you swerve by me
Have niggas walking around with Murda, ain't throwing 'em like Irv Gotti
You heard 'bout me, since high school
My goons'll get him, If I holla ""It's Murder"" like Ja Rule
I drive through
Try running off, I'm dumping off, catch murda
But what's inside the toy, is a Chucky doll
Who the fuck is y'all?
I never seen a G that took
A picture of him smoking a vape pen, outta T-Rex foot
You'sa BITCH nigga, and I hope my words get took wrong
Revolver, I'll have what's smokin' outta ya mouth a foot long
Gon' make me commit an actual murder
Just to make sure he die, I wrote every verse, in capital Murda
I'm grabbin' a burner
Run up stupid, and I'ma rock him
Beat Murda with this judge, better than Johnnie Cochran
BANG! That's for Brizz, blood left the floor soakin'
When you die, I'ma buy your house when it go on foreclosing
I'ma say everything I want whilst the floor's open
They gon' be carrying you casket outta the church
I'ma be the one holding the DOOR open
I'm the nigga this nigga can't body
I don't care how long you rap, see Murda (C-Murda)

You can bet I never tell a lie in my songs
You fakin', how the fuck you coming flexin' with a Scion?
I'm buyin' anything I put my eyes on
No bygones, no motherfuckin' bygones
You need to do better, I keep it hot, I choose weather
That's God level, solid, I'm all metal
You soft Jеllo, I am flyin' higher than falsetto
What's on special? Short bus droppеd to the floor bus
Full course, got her pussy wetter than pool shorts
They waitin', never playin' like the side of the hoop court
Decided to do more, I'm runnin' my own shit
I know I look fantastic, I'm so happy you noticed
You should focus on yourself, why your lips so loose?
You talk a lot of shit, but you don't sip no juice
High on opinions, but you low on funds
Shit, it's my time and it's your time of the month
Rhymin' ain't really nothin' but boredom
I just absorb, then I'm on
Gee, I'm exitin' orbit, but more importantly
I'm gettin' up every mornin'
Too many squares in your circle
You way too out of proportion, so act accordingly
Normally I'm torn between good and bad
How I'm 'bout to knock 'em down, uppercut, hook or jab
I ain't seen this much food since back in cookin' class
Let me see what else inside this goodie bag

The Big Bang happened when the black balloon ignited
I feel the pain shoulder to shoulder as I was knighted
The night turns to day and my days don't seem the brightest
It's like itis, I wanna take a bite out of what life is
If the President fuck around and piss off ISIS
Bury me in blueberry bills, jewels, and ices
Let's connect from mind to mind
Lies are on the rise, increasin', bigger size
Hard to victimize when evil's idolized
Inside my battered mind, I have visions of bein' broke
A broken man writin' words of wisdom inside these notes
Shattered and lost, chatterin' talk, blabberin' off
Grabbin' the cross, telling Jesús nothing matters at all, ugh
The black balloon floats, the black balloon flies
The black balloon pops, the black balloon dies
I must be the black balloon and
The children of the world always meets a doomed end
The earth will soon end
We all perish, all parents, all kids, all buried
Cemetery, ceremonious, find me at my loneliest
Life is the ugliest bitch I ever messed with
But she quick to down that nut back like Nesquik
Never try to take my life, you get your chest hit
Countin' paper with Nyyjerya 'til my flesh split
Uh, uh, uh
[Chorus: Denzel Curry & Flying Lotus]
We all cry
The day the black balloon explode, we all die
Nobody couldn't handle the truth, we all lie
Then wait to see the real exposed
'Til then, I kick that funky shit until my casket closed
We all cry (Can you save me, baby?)
The day the black balloon explode, we all die
Nobody couldn't handle the truth, we all lie
Then wait to see the real exposed (Ooh-ahh)
'Til then, I kick that funky shit until my casket closed
We all cry

Of Endless black memories
Bloodlust starts
You notice the smell of death
Time may end, serenade will start
Procession of Black Doom
Dark shadows swallow you
Review to reality

Fog has descended
You feel the power of

DJ Killa

[Verse 1: Denzel Curry]
Riding down the strip, bumping to some Pac (Pac bitch)
Nigga get the shot from the double Glock
Gun play nigga, it's that Triple C
Coming out hard, it's that MJG
Slide with the Klan, bitch you better not slip
Caught his ass slipping from the full clip
Grill that motherfucker, let that AK rip
T.I.P., bitch I got them sticks like TIP
Fuck a Burger King, if a nigga want beef
Bang bang on a bitch, like I'm Chief Keef (bang bang)
Bitches got pressure, lay a nigga six feet
R.K. all day, catch a motherfucker that's on the creep
Niggas is poppin', so death is your option
Your body gets shot till your brain is in fronted
I cut it, I chop it, you niggas is droppin'
A bullet is knocking, is harder to snuff
Run from the gauge, or run from the TEC
Really little niggas, you don't wanna see death
Really little niggas, you don't wanna see death
Really little nigga, you don't wanna see death

[Verse 2: Soulja Mook]
Strolling down the street, bumping that P, gripping that master beat
45 on my belt, you get dealt like niggas in Vegas be
Fuck that shit, I'mma hit 'em where it hurt
Knock a nigga out, then put him in a verse
Lay a nigga out, then put it on a shirt
Wrap up the tie, then put him in a hearse
Villainistic shit when I take your bitch and unload my clip
Everglades ride, let's take that trip
Cement shoes so your ass don't slip
Go and roe your boat, gently down the stream
I got snipers in the bushes that shoot like swat teams
Real nigga shit, I been 'bout mine
Killing these beats like I'm tote my nine
Yapping this shit like I bump on grind
BatKave nigga like I'm going kinda blind
Brooklyn shit, like we bikers nine
Terroristic coke, blowing on that dro
Nigga low key, no more
Bet I take your ho, till you show like a nigga ain't know
Home invade your door, express yourself like a lil bitch yo
I don't give a damn, nigga I go ham
Nah, I go hard as fuck, nigga you just outta luck
And take yourself, nigga tuck your chain
Fuck that shit, I'm bringing the pain hoYou might also like1Embed"
Black M,Brainwash Pimpin,"1 Contributor10 Pimpstress Commandments Lyrics[give me all your money, little bitch]

I’m kind of famous for being a professional bitch
And I want to give all the ladies out there
Some tips  and tricks to make every man
Do everything that you ever wanted

I want to teach you girls all a secret
Not to please a man, or stupid shit
Men have been pimping for far too long
I want to make that pimpstress game strong

A pimpstress can turn beta boys out
Make em suck a dick for your bank account
I’ll teach you the commandments of the Pimpstress Game
Fuck the patriarchy it won’t be the same!

Rule number 1
Every man wants to cum
When his dick’s in his hand
His brain is dumb

Rule number 2
Make them think you’ll screw
If you tease him
He’ll be crawling for you
You might also likeRule number 3
Don’t let him flee
His ass  belongs to you
Till you set him free

Rule number 4
Never let him score
He’ll be on his knees begging for more

I love giving men rules. They really need structure in their lives
They’re like disgusting dogs always humping everything around them
If women don’t control them, who will?
But there’s always more rules for those disgusting men in  your life, so listen up

Rule number 5
Never let him hide
Blackmail him
So he works in overdrive!

Rule number 6
Teach that man new tricks
Brainwash him
To obsess about dicks

Rule number 7
Always teach boys a lesson
Remind them their balls
Are in  your posession
Rule number 8
Dudes are never really straight
They out there waiting
For down low late

Rule number 9
Copy me and be fine
Boys will do anything
Just to be mine

Rule number 10
Be zen about men
They’re  just slaves
Living in your pig pen

So while other bitches brag about being “boss”
Talking trash about “barbie girls” in lip gloss
I’m turning boys out
And never taking  a loss

Shit on that bitch, I think she need a plunger, uh
I eat the beat like I'm hungry
High off the bitch, I think I got the munchies, uh
Percocet pop, got yo' bitch in the back and she giving me top in the Cadillac, uh
Talkin' that shit 'til I pull up with Brodie
Ridin' that gun likе a cattle back, uh
Talkin' that shit 'til I pull up with Brodie
He shoot at yo' facе and I bat yo' back, uh
Hit you in the chest no asthma attack

Hit him in his face, he forget that
You know where the shit at, uh
Run up in yo' trap, where the shit at? Huh

You run up on me then you get popped
Choppa from Black Ops
I'm gon' take stand like a black cop
Man, I'm roaming with my mans

Really, I'm just being modest, huh
I pray to God every day for forgiveness, I know sometimes I ain't that honest, huh

Gun a librarian and a barbarian, bitch, yeah, it came with the silence, yeah

[Verse 2: Big Bo]
(?) life up in this bitch so tell me what the fuck you want
All black, strapped up and ready out the Audi 4

Hit up (?) Mike and tell him ""Burn a nigga in the trunk""
Don't fuck around, cause all my niggas they run down
Run up on a nigga with a 4 pound
So show that pussy nigga, don't go around, (we bust?) around
Hit 'em down then blow it up, youngin' with me roll it up

Black M,Captain universe,"1 ContributorClips LyricsIntro
This right here is a vocal exercise
Verses and freestyles, 3 to 1, that's a ratio
Ayo so lemme explain how this is gonna work
When you hear this sound (Gun Cock)
That means I'm about to go in off the top of my head
Everything else is pre written
These verses are all wordplay
The tone and the emotions of the lyrics change
They progress in the same way as the album does
Think of all these verses as the cracks between the songs
It's extra. I want to recap what's been going on and start to hint for what's to come
This is where I, elaborate on what I mean
You know, this’ll, this’ll help explain my ideology
There's knowledge hidden in here that's gonna make the album click together
No Backups, no editing, it’s just gonna be one vocal track ya know?
I’m gonna keep it nice and simple
Simple beat
And I'm a real emcee so I don't need a crazy beat to flex
I just let my lyrics do the talking
So uh, how long did I make this beat?
45 minutes? Yeesh, alright...Let’s go

Verse 1
Ayo, don't fuck with me
Don't fuck with N!cky G
I run rap like track like Steve P
Ooh-wee
I got the lyrical heat
The inferno that burns through your journal (Mos Def)
I'm out for blood like a Crip
I'm swashbuckling ships
Put my roots with my loot like a pirate
All my music, Internet pirate-
-ed
I'm violent when my mind is dilate
I spit so much it drips on my own dick
The only thing I'm riding is my own dick
And the only thing I write is my own shit
That's a shot at ghostwriters and my consciousness
So let me tell you what my options is
I can either be pompous or an optimist
And I can even sell celibates if I was a black market auctionist, the new clients monogamous
I got this shit like a gastroenterologist
I like to pop my zits
And be with
A B.I.G. butt Notorious (bitch!)
Shut up and listen I got more christenings to give
I'm a monster like the loch ness
I could ground you up and eat you like sausage
And if you're easily nauseous don't watch this cause
I'll go straight for your esophagus
Just playin, I kill ‘em with kindness
I'm full of life like metropolis
You know I rock this shit
Swing a sword at it like a Boblikin
Leave your one legged friend hobbling
And I got lines like red Robins fries, bottomless
You might also likeVerse 2
Sometimes I don't believe in myself like I'm heaven sent
Sometimes I don't feel myself, self-celibate
I could save a million lives and find a way to talk myself out of the relishment
Cause nothings ever good enough for a perfectionist
I've been too negligent with my intelligence
I've been a resident inside of being hesitant
Focused on the irrelevant
No longer can that be my precedent
Time to develop my replenishment
And Let my actions become the evidence
I got big shoes to fill now
I grew up and filled out
But a lot of my dreams spilled out
I robbed myself and took the till out
Feeling like I shot myself in the face
With bullet cases
Put holes in a lot of situations
But now I'm trying to raise my innovations
Climb to the top of the Appalachians
Where I can grasp my aspirations
That's why I bleed in every rap that I'm making
Every beat is yeast, I been baking
The lines are the icing to complete the cake
I had patterns of bulimia so I stuff my face
I wilted, but I put new flowers in the vase
Water myself everyday
Sunk in my roots
Opened my eyes, to obtuse
More than right, then left into flight
Got high I'm off my vocal pipe
Then ate the ripe fruit
Happiness is the pursuit
Shoot any dispute
Ain't no problem I can't compute
Ain't no dispute I can't compute
And I'm en route to becoming the progidy
I’m en route to becoming the progidy
I’m en route to becoming the prog…prodigy
I’m en route to becoming to prodigy I was when I was 10
Except now I'm a grown man
I can really do things now I don't have to pretend
Like I used to in my bed-
Room, look at the starts out my window and tell myself ""I'll be there soon""
Verse 3
I started out as whack
I took the time to fine tune my craft
Fast forward my time lapse
Now I rhyme tight with no slack, I'm back, I’m back, I’m back, I’m back
I'm back and you’re addicted to me like smack
So INhale my words like crack
Relax and let your eyes roll back
I'll align your spine with a tap
I can see my abs now I sat up, I got a six-pack now
But that doesn't add up, my hunger should mean I'm Santa Claus fat now
At last I finally found my knack
I took the bite from the apple on your mac
And regurgitated it back into this rap
I got more lines than topography maps
I more obsessed with myself than making sure that you clap
But I know you're sitting there in your chair making your head move forward and back
I molded these rhymes to be harder than a cast
I reed(read) and breathe more jazz than a sax
I stick to my pacts I'm truthful like that
I snack on anything like a pack of rats
I'll give you a smack if you say you hate blacks
But as a matter of fact, I hate black cats
If I see one in my path, fuck that I'll take the long way back
And I'm a scholar in college but don't ever say that I'm frat rap
That's whack crap about smashing fat racks and raping girls with fat asses
IF I EVER SAW THAT HAPPEN I WOULD RIP OFF YOUR NUTSACKS
I kid, but don't give me a reason to create a bloodbath
Chorus
Clips, Clips, Clips, Clips
Reload (Gun Cock)
Reload (Gun Cock)
Reload…Shoot

Freestyle 1
(I see these things, these things that I bring
The metal, wood and clay to which I cling
Which I think
Will be what I die from
So I might as well enjoy it now so why run?
I put the world in my lungs
I think I’ll die young
And spit it to you as the truth from the blunt that I speak
And spit it to you as the truth from the tongue that I speak
Listen to me spit these bars as I’m freestyling)

Verse 4
This is a warpath you can track by the bloodbath
Contractions of a muskrat
Jump the fuck back
I got my palm on my nutsack
My other palm’s in the palms that consist of my dub sac, Ha!
I got a Backwood under my mustache
I hide my eyes with some sunglass-es
I copped for free, fuck your logo fashion
I'm comfortable with who I am, I don't need to be masked in
I'm back and back in as the captain of these captions
An assassin with verb-al actions
You, plus your crew, is still a subtraction
I'm narcissistic I only think about my rations
My mind is the abstract rap contraption so fasten
Your seat belts, this is a wild ride
Resurrection from a mind that died
Guided back into the life of light
Then applied with a wide stride of pride
Never slip or slide
Never tongue-tied
I reside in music to confide
In my thoughts ideas and fears
I'm in gear and I’m not looking at the rear view mirror
I found my career
It appeared at a severe time of fear
I engineered it to be premier
And Now I see with my ears
And I'm in the clear of the frontier
Fight or flight?
Stress me I might take your life
Smite ya with the height of what I cite
Take a bite
I'm a knight of the night
I dwell in the moonlight when the ghouls have goon fights
I'm outright polite face to face
But when I write, I might just put you in your place
I got the sleight of hand, point and case
I work real hard every day's a rat race

Verse 5
I'm about to inject you with the verbal slime
The vegetables of rhyme
Nutrition for your mind
Poke your nerves in your spine
Emcees be all over the place with their rhymes
While mine remain defined
Glued to perfection
I kiss the mic with affection
My mind is taking time for some stretching
Bending galaxies into my verbal collection
My ethics remain the most pristine
You don’t know half the shit I've seen
Drugs, violence and money ain't my scene, that shits obscene
Failure is not in my genome
I eat rappers like amino
Acid I spit, I'm sick make you need chemo
I got the heart of a king, I'm casino
I keep my profile on the d low
That way if I need to snap a neck, I can creep slow
I'm quiet but alert like Cappuccino
For every rhyme you have, I got a kilo
I torpedo my ego of being half Latino with rhymes that are jalapeño
A mean flow, like a lunch money
Bully
I got leverage like a pulley
Pull your body in the gully
Then assassinate ya subtly
Fire rhymes, I’ll boil your blood till its bubbly
I must boil your blood because I can't leave evidence
I can't have a conscious that is decadence
I'm perfecting the elements
So I can raise a hell-ish genesis
Inject ya membranous tissues
With my sentences
Your brain is my new residence
So prepare for ideas of excellence and long nights of restlessness
I'm reckless, I'll erode your skeletal with tetanus
Spit the most venomous
Leave you stranded in a nebulous
Unless you're in for my best interest
I'll show you benevolence
Fly us away on a Pegasus
Let you benefit from my intelligence
My rhymes are the perception of medicine that is perfection
Known to cure cancer, bulimia and depression
That last one is a self-tested assessment

Verse 6
I'm back with a bad habit of being a rabbit and too hop to be toe tag-ged
I'll incinerate you if you discriminately use the term faggot
Bury your skeleton inside of the slime of the maggots
That's the way its gotsta happen if you're a foul mouth bastard who thinks backwards you capsize slacker
Step into my rapture
This is chapter, one
It's do this or do a backwards gun
That last one rhymed with try
You imbecile child step into my trial
Let's see if you follow the crevices or smile
Let's see if you can decipher my rhyme style
It's gold wealth, disguised in stealth
Subliminal messages that tend to melt
Your brain it's actually not good for you health
So maybe you shouldn't listen to me
Maybe you should just do your own thing
But just know I have a swarm of bees ready to sting
Emerging, from underneath my lunula fing-ertips
Talk ya shit, I ain't allergic
In fact I'll probably learn it
Churn it, inside of the pot
Stir it
Take the recipe and burn it
Then emerge it
2.0 the newer version
And now everybody's drinking my syrup
I'm the best in the west let's not get into a stirrup
From CA through Oregon, Washington to Alberta

Chorus

Freestyle 2
(You wanna hear some words?
I don't give a fuck about a verb, or a noun, I'm profound
Sniffing out pounds of herb like a hound
I'm always at work
Spinning pizzas picture perfect round
I got a low-key sound and I'm bound
To have a Loki crown that's golden brown
Pretty girls pucker like a goldfish mouth
I’m about to get a sucker on me down south
I'm losing my marbles like change in the couch
I guess my mindset is my new allowance)

Verse 7
I elope, in these dark thoughts of a man
Reaching for the ends to which they span
I'm creeping on myself I just need the white van
Weighing actions vs. consequences by the gram
I've been blowing myself up like ‘42 japan
I'm the number one rank in any clan
And I'm just speaking frank, Anne
And I’m walking on the plank of the shark tank
My boat already sank so I'd better start to thank
Oil the gears as they crank, swivel the gun on the tank
And I'm the dope boy and this here is dank
Every song has a ploy, I come out with a shank
This ain't a toy, this the gun of a tank
This ain't a coin, this is the whole bank
I'm the dope boy, my product is dank

Verse 8
I’ll hydrate ya like hydrocortisone
I'm in my zone I’ve already flown
Migrated to Oregon
My heads a mess I need a comb
Miss my family kiss ‘em on the phone
I'm up and coming
I'm all up and grown
I’m tryna compare myself to the legend of Davy Jones
I'm in construction watch out for my orange cones
And I'm known for drinking milk so I'm not prone to broken bones
So come at me with your full blown
And problems about the O-zone

Verse 9
I came out, I came out
I came out, I came out
And when my mother came around
She said ""I hate your sound""
I thought ""Fuck you talking bout now?""
She said ""You're not brown, you didn't grow up downtown, sometimes I think you do these things just to see me frown""
I thought ""Fuck off, can't knock me down""
I'm not in this for a crown, I'm in this only for the sound
Who needs to care whether I'm black white or brown?
It's only what I say and convey that counts
I was in the pound, impounded, who let the dogs out?
I may have been lost but I came back found
With a new collar and a shiny name tag on
A whole new lawn of grass to aim and pee on
Eat sleep and play with repeat on
Barking at the mailman to be gone
Cause I don't trust the government
It seems like they're crooked and crumbling
I wanna make my paycheck and not funnel it
Back into paths where I just run a bit
People need structure but government feels fluctuated
Easily hated, but I think we'd hate it if we didn't make it
And if we didn't have laws we would all have died 100 years ago all too faded, it's undebated
Human nature is more destructive than creative
That's why you should praise me for being patient
I got a relation-
-ship with God
And he says ""Dog
It's all backwards, our spots
Responsibility in you, in knocks
You're the new boss, take it out for a shot.""
I'm shocked, for a second my heart stopped and my stomach dropped...
Me and God just flopped...
So the first thing I’mma do is smash the crown with a rock
Burn the throne, no more idols to mock
My idea of leadership is like Spock
Rid of emotion and respect the cock (Atmosphere)
Eat, sleep and fuck is what we got
Take it back to the basics of the block
I need your help so give me your hand
There's a revolution out there for us to understand
All of us create it, there's no plan
Shits been spinning the same like a fan
Let stand, and create a template to end all of what we debate
This is a race, keep your pace

Chorus

Freestyle 3
(It courses through my brain
It-it-it-it’s in my sayings
It’s every motherfucking thing that I’ve been playing
And every, I’ve been, I’ve been spraying
Running through these god damn lyrics every day in
Day in, night out
Cause I’m a dark knight right now
I’m under the moon, I’m literally on Mt. Baldy
You motherfuckers ain’t know shit about the shots that I’ve be calling
Man what the fuck am I talking about?
I’m just, I’m just high right now
I, I’m too high, I’m too high
Literally I’m like 2000 feet above, above sea level
Check my, check my fucking levels
I need to turn the gain down I sound distorted
Man my rhymes are so nice it’s like I’m imported)

Verse 10
Ayo I was six feet deep, in something that I dug
But I just pulled myself up outta that rut
I’m here to stir a muck
Bring the fuck with the ruckus
Ooh I'm so luscious
This is how many fucks I give
(……..)
Hut hut, Andrew Luck
I'm back in play
Or re le, Chez Jose
This is where I lay this is where I wanna stay
Every night every day
Blow up like Michael Bay
Actually fuck fame, that shit cray-
-fish, if you in it for the money you a bitch
I don't say this often but you can suck my dick
Egotistical pricks I turn into bowels
I'm a wild dog you want to hear me howl?
I'm like a soul on ice with the solstice at night
Insomniac werewolf with a bite
I scream for ice cream but I wouldn't do much for a Klondike
Don't believe the hype, they're just alright
(but G the motherfucker who strikes with might)

Verse 11
I got bars that’ll take me further than mars
I’ve known it from the start so I’ve been perfecting my art
Your part, is not much in my scheme
Just make sure you scream when I’m on stage
Have everybody listening
My life’s pristine
Wake up and smoke weed
Say “Hello” to the team
We just trying to get some C.R.E.A.M
Wu-Tang, who saying
That I’m playing? I’m a rap abomination
Emcee’s praying that I won’t slay ‘em
On their own beat, on their own street
And hear their mother’s weep
As I leave a card by their feet
Says “I ended the blindness, Sincerely the Finest”
Ooh-wee
I’ll always kill ‘em with kindness
Ooh-wee
I got the lyrical heat
The inferno that burns though your journal (Mos Def)
I put my sweatshirt on so that’s word to Earl
I expel pearls, I’m not talking about the necklace
I’m reckless, I’ll always eat a pussy out for breakfast
I’m next bitch, so don’t judge this dude
You don’t know what the fuck I’ve been through
Too, much has been put into this
So I ain’t leaving until I have a gold fucking necklace
Yes, I, I must spit to impress
Before I’m the next best to put the mic to rest
Mos Def, taught me mathematic tactics
Most rap is lacking
So I’ll start the reaction of (INhale) in action
That’s oxygen in action
I got L’s being passed ‘n’
I can sleep when I’m dead so for now let me rap

Verse 12
I'm leaping off cliffs to expand my wingspan
Morphing my brain into a sphere
So every angle that appears is clear
Gain the ability to sneer in the face of fear
Fear is nothing
Compared to what I've been cooking and stuffing
Inside the turkey
It's murky and doesn't understand what is mercy
It's out for blood and boy am I thirsty
Swimming in dreams of virgins and wine
Disembodied the shrine
Gave it a design
Of thought, individuality
Acts of kind with immortal minds
Death is just a race against time
To see who can accomplish what within it
Death to the men who undermined women
And I feel as if I never will die
As I can accomplish whatever I try
Apply my mind
Into the eyes and look right through the sky
My soul is as soft as the fuzz on a peach
Embodying every freak that I meet
We have more genes
Than every speck of sand on a beach
What does that mean?
Where is the gene
That makes an act of mean?
Where is the gene
That births a queen?
Where is the gene
That causes my lucid dreams?
Where is the gene that made G
The Jesus of DJ-ing
And spitting this lyrics?
(You know this shit is more than just appearance
This shit is really, it goes deep inside of my veins
It courses through my sayings)

Verse 13
It's me and my words against the world
I talk a lot so I don't need a referral
You can't unrecord, so this shit is eternal
I’m smooth with my verbal and this beat is fertile
So I fuck it, every night tuck it
Into bed, wake up she gives me head
Then puts her head on my stomach
She tells me she loves it and loves when
I unbutton what's covering her
And plummet into her muffin
Pussy so sweet
Caramel, chocolate vanilla and poppy seed
Yo I'm papa G
Word to b poppa I g
I see, hip-hop properly
I'm about to take radio rap out of poverty
Run an iPod monopoly with a free music economy
Wreck the record label my philosophy
I've overcome mountains
You got anything else that can stop me?
You best eat your broccoli
Cause you gon’ need to be real strong to stop me
Except I ain’t stopping

Chorus

Freestyle 4
(Except I ain’t stopping
You copy?
Think about what you say before you're sorry
That's why I'm old fashioned like Atari
I'm on my grind doing Ollie’s
All these raps are quality
I don't have a favorite one, I'm about equality
I'm in the trees like a koala be
I got the world's best heart, I'm fatherly
That's why all these crazy bitches want to have their fawn with me
Quit calling me, I don't wanna be bothered
You see, I've met a whole lot of you ladies
And you’re all fucking crazy
Had one girl fake a pregnancy
Expecting me to stick around
All these women try and tie me down with a baby
Ah ""Just put it in without a condom"" I've heard way too often
Followed by ""It's alright, I took the pill""
Bitch I don't trust you and that's how I feel, Ha!
I ain't amused but you're a muse for me to use
Always spew the holy holy like in the pew
I got a birds eye view and sick with my own flu
With which I might fly by and kill you
Catch that or was that too much for you?
I hope you caught it cause now your finally dead
Now I don't have to waste any lead
You're so-so but I'm every thread
And all your opinions are just things that I’ve already said)

Verse 14
My lips are always chapped
From all the air I drag
What goes in must come out and
My sentences are bad
My soul is at the end of a mag
I see a man with a bag
I look the other way, I see the man with the segregated flag
Which way do I go? What do you think?
You take me stupid or someone on the brink
Of world peace and humanity in sync
And all of this within an arms reach
So I can't blink until I find the missing link

Verse 15
21 years in the making
And the whole time I been going bacon
I think I've been pacing
I'm near my final destination
Life isn't patient
It wants what it wants and takes it
And then it sees what it wants and creates it
These are the basic rules of life
Day after night, until the end of time
So why do we fight?
What is wrong? What is right?
The only lesson I've learned is don't believe the hype
Can we even learn? Or is it just lessons that we have to earn?
Why do we yearn? Life always ends in turn
So why do I smoke the fern? Is it the INhalation of the burn?
Why do I like to curse? Why do I like to flirt?
Why do I write this verse? What really are words worth?
Do they really serve a purpose or is it getting lost in the universe?
Should I try to fly like the birds, or dig tunnels with the worms?
Why do I want these things?
Are the answers really what I search?
I'm trying to answer life before I lie in the hearse, yeah!

Verse 16
I see, I see hip-hop as a gun
It gives power to the man who yields one
But it gives a whole nother level of power to the man who really knows how to wield one
Same thing how it takes talent to go semi pro
But it takes a whole lotta work to go professional
It's a big difference
It's the big leagues vs. the amateurs
It’s the circumference vs. the diameter
The worker vs. the manager
The peasant vs. the chancellor
The black house cat vs. the panther
It's me vs. hip hops ramblers
Quit being inconsiderate
And taking away from an art form
So you can get your liquor in
That was built to make a difference
Through brutal honesty and enlightening the policies
Of what us inaudibly
To common to see
NBC, just wants gossip
I'm here in the form of the long lost prophet
Allah reincarnated with Muhammad
Serving the blood of my heart in a goblet
Knowledge of an entire life in every droplet
Flow of a faucet that's sick like vomit
That last line is a composite of a sonnet
I'm preparing to pay with my life
And my words are my breath, and wallet
Is being held under a knife
The pressure is precise
The ethics of a man I like to exercise
Experience is the best teacher of wrong vs. right
So don't believe the hype
I'm not always right despite being a white, man
I'm right because I stay up at night to write my insight until I can't feel my hand
This is something that's bigger than me
And I won't quit until I can put it in between my teeth

Verse 17
They say what I say ain't as important as what I do
But I'm confused, because what I bring to you is the same two
Hold up Steve let's sniff out the Blues Clues
This one's sweat on my neck like J. Crew
Let's sniff out the Blues Clues and take a J cruise
Chains of thought weigh like slave shoes
Not what you should see but what they choose
It's what they put on our shoes with swoosh labels
We released information over the Internet for free to anyone who was able
With cells into portable tables and cables

Chorus

Freestyle 5
(Uh, I don’t know what to say, uh
Wassup, wassup, wassup, wassup
I can be an emcee or I could be the drummer
I can make more sound than the engine of a Hummer
Bummer, that you have to sit the sideline
While I spit raps and ride the high rise
You need to climb a mountain just to get in my eyesight
And I can make this real messy like we was in a pie fight
That's 3.14
What’chu know about that? Nothing? Well there's the door
I suggest you still get out while it's easy like a whore
Cause if you stand there and rebuttal when I come back around there's gonna be a Whole. Lot. More.)

Verse 18
My face been multiplying acne like I'm a mathlete
I’m feeling crappy like 2015 Crabtree
I feel like a has be, so I drink coffee, until the break of dawn
While rapping, zeppelin rocking, ignorance the new armeggadon
I've had lots of time to reflect the concept of many wrongs
Addiction to electronic restriction has humanity dead and gone
Has everything I think been thought? Is it just the credits on?
Am I ever creative or just invasive like Jason Statham in The Italian Job? That's a whole different song. Pause. New topic

Verse 19
I’m watching the blur of green trees and leaves
Feeling like nothing ever mattered
I can feel the vibration through the cars tire feet
Recline and the rocks’ll start to sing you to sleep
Elevation is what we seek, the summit is under my feet
This forest is quiet no birds cheep
Fresh air meant to INhale deep
The smoke from the blunt starts to seep
Into my lungs take in the heat
Smoke on the view, gaze on the haze
Baker, I’m covered I'm fog
Crepes with a glaze
Of hazelnut gourmet sauce
Topped off with whipped bliss of the gods
Smoke smog with my dawgs
Smash, no items or mods
Not a monster but a cookie hog
I'm pretty odd, do whatever I feel when I wake up
Too many things to do than stay put and stay stuck
Add a little flavor with a spray of the shaker
I'm a creator who just gave this crater
And it's big as fuck
You could roll in its deep but it’s like the wheels on the bus
Darkness makes you ponder if the difference of life is on purpose or luck?
Why am I me and not a big buck?
Why does my head point to happiness and big bucks?
Why is my head not the shape of a duck?
What if monkeys are secretly smarter than us?
What if they're the ones running the experi-munts?
They act dump to puppeteer us with ropes
You can't understand any other life except the one yours chose
But yet all our electrons rotate so close
Created the difference between inland and coast
Dead and living folks
And the concept of hope
(Isotopes and molecules
I be running through this shit that I cule)

Verse 20
I can think
Though any situation
I got the bossest consciousness
Filled with the rawest faucet
Of flawless thoughts that blossom
Into colossal gospel
My words are fossils
Here to stay
Spread and spray
From Boston to Austin to the bay
I display an awesome buffet
Of parfaits that convey
Past clichés and will live on past my day when I pass away
I’m molding my days like clay
And churning the furnace to not decay
So preserve my DNA
Like fine cabernet
Wine
And sip it on my judgment day
Eat my words like sorbet soufflé
At my cafe
The fires crackling
My mouth is babbling
Trying to tackle what happening
Around me, but sadly
I don't think I'm scratching
The surface of the half of it
I'm passing time trying to remind
Every pacifist that they're accurate
I'm trying to ejaculate the immaculate all over your face
Make ya taste my miraculous case
I'm trying to calculate every single angle
Untangle hatred
And become the grateful patrons
Underneath those clothes we're all naked, we're all related
So let's hug each other, snap the moment and paint it
Make it a song on everybody's playlist
And label it the greatest

Chorus

Freestyle 6
(Oh you’re a fat ass? Boo-hoo
Quit going to McDonald’s and make your own fucking food
It’s not rocket science it’s not even voodoo
Don’t eat donuts motherfucker get your head right
And at night, I don’t obey the law of red lights
I do donuts what I drive, I spin around in my mind
I got the eyesight of the three blind mice times thrice
That’s nine, that’s nice, I don’t listen to Christ
I don’t like being told what not and what to do
Call me a rebel but that’s just what I’m meant to do
I’m amendable but if I led, I’d be incredible
Don’t run out of lead in your pencil
Cause my lessons’ immensful)

Verse 21
I’m on 16th alley in the Cascade valley
North of Cali
I been working out my mind like Bally
Cooking something up on the galley
Putting beats in body bags, add up the tally
My raps are pieces of art, I got a whole gallery
I can pep talk a rally into a riot for the finale
Flow sweeter than berries, like Halle
Ooh I like them caramel girls
The scandalous girls
Fuck me like an animal girls
Bring out my instincts
Make me go primate
Annihilate your eardrums
With vibrate, tions
I hydrate with nitrate
So I flow with nitrous
Let loose like on Friday night with a pipe
Packed with kief of the leaves
That allows me to catch Z's
Cause I don't sleep, Geez Louise
Nicky G, He's the missing piece of the puzzle
Between peace vs. muzzles
I paint a picture with my ease-l
I got a lot of power I need diesel
With a flow so lethal my language needs to be illegal
I got the nose of a beagle and the talons of an eagle
I turn ya into fecal then roll you around like a dung beetle
I’ll stab you with a bees needle and put you in the fetal
Position, a fucking animal on every composition
159 is the addition of my cognition
So when I'm speaking you need to shut the fuck up and listen
Just kidding
But I'm just more than a musician
I got food for thought that's nutrition
I'm a poetic dietician
And fuck paying tuition
I'd rather spray my ammunition
I'm in a high gear transmission
And I just sparked the ignition

Verse 22
I been creeping through the peep hole
Weed O's till my feet slow
Shoot a beat then I reload
Nicky G, G is for giant with my fe-fi-fe-flow
Stomp, the ground erodes
Yo he flow like he got the cheat codes
He is not an equal
King Midas touch when he flow, he speak gold
Deceitful, like Rumpelstiltskin
Like Rumpelstiltskin
Chilling with the fill in villain
I’m just your enemy until I make a killing
I’m throwing curveballs like Curt Schilling
I'm iller than a chinchilla that has ten children
Fighting off evil women like Scott Pilgrim
I swear I've met more than a million
And I don't do this for them
I do this for the feeling
I do this for the Chem-
-istry of my brain stem
Raise the mayhem
Out my cranium
Not the best
But def-
-initely in the top ten
And offend-
Ded if you think diff-er-ent
Not what I want but I spit what I am

Verse 23
I may be introverted and shy
But in my mind, Lies
A consciousness, where
I got enough confidence and competence to accomplish an entire continent
I got a horoscope of a broke metronome
I'm the holy ghost giving every note a home
I’ll straighten out your head like a comb
I'm flowing Rivers like Joan
Get girls wet like boats
I float with ease
I got a whole lotta ways to cut the cheese
I got an army of chords and keys
I breathe these raps like breeze
I got your hands up like I told you to freeze
But unlike the police, I'm pro free
I’m digging tunnels underground where the moles be
Dip me like guacamole
I'm raising all you kids like Angelina Jolie
I'm a god, on the low key
Like a bass note
I was born in the winter I'm straight cold
I’ll give you a splinter with a dull icicle
I’ll break the ice in your skull
Throw your corpse off the hull
You'll feed the seagulls
My words should be illegal I'm so lethal
I got retrieval skills like a beagle
Snatching the egg of an eagle
Which I feed my people to lead past the cathedral to laugh in the face of evil
And I won't stop until the Devil lays peaceful
And all men are treated equal
I got a sequence of sequels
This is just the prequel of the needle

Chorus

Freestyle 7
(I just smoked a blunt
My body is retarded
My mind has departed
Rolled a back and sparked it
The moon isn't even the farthest
I've traveled, through galaxies and seen through fallacies of the most lethargic
That last line was a hiccup
That last beat I made, I need to turn the kick up
Make my vocal pop because listen how I spit luck
Gain respect and get trust
Maintain flexed, Nick’s
Maintain flexed, Nick the mista
It's when the pressures on that defines who you are
Are you subpar or you can reach the bar?
Except the bar is meant to be lifted, and I'm the motherfucking gifted!
Who be spitting and kicking all of this god damn different
Things that I’ve been lifting)

Verse 24
I'm like a magician I can disappear into thin air
I brainstorm so much I wake up with Einstein’s hair
I'm in a race against a tortoise and I'm the hare
But this ain't the story you used to hear
I'm trying to rewrite history with a flare so rare
My skins so fair I can give you a ghost-like scare
But in reality I'm sweeter than a pear
With a mistook left hook that can leave you impaired
My words sting like Nair
And they slap like a snare
I rhyme snuggly like a big teddy bear
My flow spreads like a spiders web
Step into my lair
I'm making the world change, I’m not waiting like Mayer
I spend my time as a god like creator
So if music dies I can rise and be the savior

Verse 25
Ain't no limits to this gift
I'm tired of cheese and crackers I want to live the Ritz
Bliss, death has given me a kiss
But that's another story that's was some shit
Let's just say I appreciate what it means to live
I hold in my genes(jeans) my kids
And honest, I hope they never get my lisp
Money power and happiness, I can't scratch away this itch, it's a bitch
My soul could never be beat even by Chuck Norris' fists
My goal is to become a young enormous prince
My name on all the tourists’ lists
A camera click with a horde of pics
Give all the Swedish chicks a foreign dick
I feel immortal with this
Take a shot I pray it miss, cause my sleeves' got more tricks
Too many things I want to fix
I'm just a kid I eat Trix
I want to get under your skin like ticks
The clock ticks and tocks I think time is a paradox
I have too many thoughts to talk
And if you're racist, suck my cock here's a box of dicks
That last line was a little bit ridiculous
But that’s ok because I’m named Nicholas
And I try to stay fresh and packed like pickles is
I have a high ego it's hard to get with this
Victorious, of the people, my name is Nicholas

Verse 26
I'm here to steal the loot, kick the boot
I got two, truces but killed Usylluss with his own trident
I'm walking in Stride chewing Trident
I got about 5 packs of Dentyne Ices
Juicy Fruits in Orbit around Hubba Bubba and Double Mint
I chew ‘em all I don't care what the price is
Truth is, my crew chew gum or they're left lifeless
I might smite this, so tell me what the hype is
I'm hip and I hop like the bunny from Energizer
Summon my chariot I got the Christ-risen Chrysler
No more V-Techs and no more ricers
I ball all day Like Mike in a white shirt
Lurk all night ya might get hurt
Or shot by all my squads Super Soakers
Do it for fun like we was some poachers
Taxiderm your head real big like “yeah, yeah we're some big boasters”
Wake up every morning staring at it with a cup of Roasters

Chorus

Freestyle 8
(Now don't get me wrong I like ass and tits
But I'd much rather see a girls assets
If she doesn't have good morals I'll send that chick backwards
And sit back and roll a Backwood on my lips
And smoke till my lungs hiccup
Smart girls are the one’s that gets my dick up)

Verse 27
Hip-hop never died, I just woke her up with a kiss
Lashes exposed her eyes, they told me she loved her Nick
Slipped in with my dick, now I'm addicted to it
All it is, is finding new ways to lick the clit while I spit
New ways to express the messages I give
She indulges my bliss, told me “Don’t stop, don't quit
I want you to give me every last inch”
In the morning I don't split because I found my niche
She's holding a crown and I'm the fresh young prince
I won't call her a bitch, she's too precious to hit
Even is she's got blood, I'll go down like a Crip

Verse 28
I be puff-puff passing on the medical
But passing over edibles
I'm incredibly credible
My knowledge goes deep as if I got several
Minds inside my cranium
If Big Bills is closed then I'm gonna be breaking in
I’m about to eat balls cheesed to perfection
And slices known to give saliva erections
I'm just messin’ but I remain sincere with my adolescence
I ran 5 miles today gasping for breath and
Everyday I eat Oatmeal for breakfast
I'm trying to grow a mustache
But it's hard when I still act like a rug rat
It feels great in Colorado to have the sun back
I'm chasing nirvana like I run track
Yanni rolling backwoods
Smoke don't make me rap good
Time slows so much it goes backwards
It's the fountain of youth and that's word
Backwoods of fat herbs
And slaphappy rap masters
The rock I'm on makes my ass hurt
Stomach rumbling makes me want to go to the crapper
Oh wait I'm on the beat though
Sit and think about that one for a minute
I’m aiming for big game shoot and skin it
Hang the antlers to remind myself I’m driven
And I want to be livid in Bolivia
And flip all of our media
J.K. Rowling in the deep
Harry potter nerd but Adele puts me to sleep
Me and death been known to meet
Am I lucky or too grim to creep?
Piling my dreams into a heap
Then repeat through my speech

Verse 29
I used to dream about the day that I would die
But now I can't stop eating it up like pie
I got a sweet tooth for equality and love
And if you're full of hate I won't share my drugs
Addicted to lick the sweat on my upper lip
Never will I slip when I’m passionate
I've always been too cocky of myself
I held up my ego like a belt
I've had days I felt like my heart could melt
And others where all I did was puff top shelf
I can break your focus
Trick you with hocus-pocus
Bullshit ya with no bogus
Leave your Solo shot Hope-less
I see more stem and flower than florists
I'm the hour of power with a flow so enormous
Talk is cheap just show me where the smoke is
Within the universe we're all just tourists
I eat chips and churros at Torres
I got the horns of a Taurus and
I drank the potent potion of emotion in motion
Now I'm feeling like my soul was stolen

Verse 30
I don't have a DJ, it's just me
I also don't have a free day because I'm also an emcee
I hear these kids rapping about how drake got a Wusa
But what's even cooler is I can play 12 scales on a tuba
I wanna hear a jazz diss track
The battle of back-to-back saxes
Bass lines with more scales than basses
Attacking guitar axes
Piano strings springing like a mattress
Improvised not practiced
That’s why my rhymes are going down as a classic

Chorus

More wrong that right? Schrute Dwight
And mama Mary made mad marvelous muffins making Martha managing maniacs maybe moping mopeing mild Mark missing memories, her enemy...
Haha, what the fuck did that even mean?
I don’t know, but it sounded heavenly
Show me someone better than me
Uh, I just smoked a Backwood, I didn’t even get that high
I got buzzed as fuck though, that Back-tobacco dry, haha
And I'm back in the woods rolling backwoods that are that good
I'm a slaphappy rap master
My favorite sound is the sound of laughter
I do unseen good deeds like I'm Casper
I've touched more lives than a badass pastor
I'm shutting on this beat I treat it like the crapper
I know too many lines to be a bad actor
I'm so much more than just a rapper

I’ll see you on the other side of the moon, Disc 2
This is fun but I gotta go to bed man
Ah fuck it who am I kidding? (I’m not going to bed
I’m about to, I’m about to go home and uh
Ya know just kick more rhymes out my head
Smoke a little dope till my eyes red
Go to another planet where I can pretend)
Haha, alright I’m outta here
I got motherfucking Clips! Clips!

Anytime, I’ll hit the three-point like a free throw
Yo you see me on the street, give me a word!

Black M,CHOOSE WISELY INTERMISSION,"1 ContributorThe Description of a New World, Called the Blazing-World LyricsTo all Noble and Worthy Ladies,  

This present Description of a New World, was made as an Appendix to my Observations upon Experimental Philosophy; and, having some Sympathy and Coherence with each other, were joined together as Two several Worlds, at their Two Poles. But, by reason most Ladies take no delight in Philosophical Arguments, I separated some from the mentioned Observations, and caused them to go out by themselves, that I might express my Respects, in presenting to them such Fancies as my Contemplations did afford. The First Part is Romancical; the Second, Philosophical; and the Third is merely Fancy; or (as I may call it) Fantastical. And if (Noble Ladies) you should chance to take pleasure in reading these Fancies, I shall account myself a Happy Creatoress: If not, I must be content to live a Melancholy Life in my own World; which I cannot call a Poor World, if Poverty be only want of Gold, and Jewels: for, there is more Gold in it, than all the Chymists ever made; or, (as I verily believe) will ever be able to make. As for the Rocks of Diamonds, I wish, with all my Soul, they might be shared amongst my Noble Female Friends; upon which condition, I would willingly quit my Part: And of the Gold, I should desire only so much as might suffice to repair my Noble Lord and Husband's Losses: for, I am not Covetous, but as Ambitious as ever any of my Sex was, is, or can be; which is the cause, That though I cannot be Henry the Fifth, or Charles the Second; yet, I will endeavor to be, Margaret the First: and, though I have neither Power, Time nor Occasion, to be a great Conqueror, like Alexander, or Cesar; yet, rather than not be Mistress of a World, since Fortune and the Fates would give me none, I have made one of my own. And thus, believing, or, at least, hoping, that no Creature can, or will, Envy me for this World of mine, I remain,  

Noble Ladies, Your Humble Servant, M. Newcastle.

The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World  

A Merchant travelling into a foreign country, fell extremely in love with a young Lady; but being a stranger in that Nation, and beneath her, both in birth and wealth, he could have but little hopes of obtaining his desire; however his love growing more and more vehement upon him, even to the slighting of all difficulties, he resolved at last to steal her away; which he had the better opportunity to do, because her Father's house was not far from the Sea, and she often using to gather shells upon the shore accompanied not with above two to three of her servants, it encouraged him the more to execute his design. Thus, coming one time with a little light Vessel, not unlike a Packet-boat, manned with some few Sea-men, and well victual led, for fear of some accidents, which might perhaps retard their journey, to the place where she used to repair; he forced her away. But when he fancied himself the happiest man of the World, he proved to be the most unfortunate; for Heaven frowning at his theft, raised such a Tempest, as they knew not what to do, or whether to steer their course; so that the Vessel, both by its own lightness, and the violent motion of the wind, was carried as swift as an Arrow out of a Bow, towards the North-pole, and in a short time reached the Icy Sea, where the wind forced it amongst huge pieces of Ice; but being little, and light, it did by the assistance and favour of the gods to this virtuous Lady, so turn and wind through those precipices, as if it had been guided by some experienced Pilot, and skillful Mariner. But alas! Those few men which were in it, not knowing whether they went, nor what was to be done in so strange an Adventure, and not being provided for so cold a Voyage, were all frozen to death; the young Lady only, by the light of her Beauty, the heat of her Youth, and Protection of the Gods, remaining alive. Neither was it a wonder that the men did freeze to death; for they were not only driven to the very end or point of the Pole of that World, but even to another Pole of another World, which joined close to it; so that the cold having a double strength at the conjunction of those two Poles, was insupportable.

At last, the Boat still passing on, was forced into another World; for it is impossible to round this World’s Globe from Pole to Pole, so as we do from East to West; because the Poles of the other World, joining to the Poles of this, do not allow any further passage to surround the World that way; but if any one arrives to either of these Poles, he is either forced to return, or to enter into another World: and lest you should scruple at it, and think, if it were thus, those that live at the Poles would either see two Suns at one time, or else they would never want the Sun's light for six months together, as it is commonly believed. You must know, that each of these Worlds having its own Sun to enlighten it, they move each one in their peculiar Circles; which motion is so just and exact, that neither can hinder or obstruct the other; for they do not exceed their Tropics: and although they should meet, yet we in this World cannot so well perceive them, by reason of the brightness of our Sun, which being nearer to us, obstructs the splendor of the Sun of the other World, they being too far off to be discerned by our optic perception, except we use very good Telescopes; by which, skillful Astronomers have often observed two or three Suns at once. But to return to the wandering Boat, and the distressed Lady; she seeing all the Men dead, found small comfort in life; their Bodies which were preserved all that while from putrefaction and stench, by the extremity of cold, began now to thaw, and corrupt; whereupon she having not strength enough to fling them over-board, was forced to remove out of her small Cabine, upon the deck, to avoid the nauseous smell; and finding the Boat swim between two plains of Ice, as a stream that runs betwixt two shores, at last perceived land, but covered all with Snow: from which came, walking upon the Ice, strange Creatures, in shape like Bears, only they went upright as men; those Creatures coming near the Boat, catches hold of it with their Paws, that served them instead of hands; some two or three of them entered first; and when they came out, the rest went in one after another; at last having viewed and observed all that was in the Boat, they spake to each other in a language which the Lady did not understand; and having carried her out of the Boat, sunk it, together with the dead men.  

The Lady now finding her self in so strange a place, and amongst such wonderful kind of Creatures, was extreamly strucken with fear, and could entertain no other Thoughts, but that every moment her life was to be a sacrifice to their cruelty; but those Bear-like Creatures, how terrible soever they appear'd to her sight, yet were they so far from exercising any cruelty upon her, that rather they shewed her all civility and kindness imaginable; for she being not able to go upon the Ice, by reason of its slipperiness, they took her up in their rough arms, and carried her into their City, where instead of Houses, they had Caves under ground; and as soon as they enter'd the City, both Males and Females, young and old, flock together to see this Lady, holding up their Paws in admiration; at last having brought her into a certain large and spacious Cave, which they intended for her reception, they left her to the custody of the Females, who entertained her with all kindness and respect, and gave her such victuals as they used to eat; but seeing her Constitution neither agreed with the temper of that Climate, nor their Diet, they were resolved to carry her into another Island of a warmer temper; in which were men like Foxes, onely walking in an upright shape, who received their neighbors the Bear-men with great civility and Courtship, very much admiring this beauteous Lady; and having discoursed some while together, agreed at last to make her a Present to the Emperor of their World; to which end, after she had made some short stay in the same place, they brought her cross that Island to a large River, whose stream run smooth and clear, like Chrystal; in which were numerous Boats, much like our Fox-traps; in one whereof she was carried, some of the Bear- and Fox-men waiting on her; and as soon as they had crossed the River, they came into an Island where there were Men which had heads, beaks and feathers, like wild-Geese, only they went in an upright shape, like the Bear-men and Fox-men: their rumps they carried between their legs, their wings were of the same length with their Bodies, and their tails of an indifferent size, trailing after them like a Ladie's Garment; and after the Bear- and Fox-men had declared their intention and design to their Neighbors, the Geese- or Bird-men, some of them joined to the rest, and attended the Lady through that Island, till they came to another great and large River, where there was a preparation made of many Boats, much like Birds nests, only of a bigger size; and having crost that River, they arrived into another Island, which was of a pleasant and mild temper, full of Woods and the Inhabitants thereof were Satyrs, who received both the Bear- Fox- and Bird men, with all respect and civility; and after some conferences (for they all understood each others language) some chief of the Satyrs joining to them, accompanied the Lady out of that Island to another River, wherein were many handsome and commodious Barges; and having crost that River, they entered into a large and spacious Kingdom, the men whereof were of a Grass-Green Complexion, who entertained them very kindly, and provided all conveniences for their further voyage: hitherto they had only crost Rivers, but now they could not avoid the open Seas any longer; wherefore they made their Ships and tacklings ready to sail over into the Island, where the Emperor of the Blazing- world (for so it was call'd) kept his residence.

Very good Navigators they were; and though they had no knowledge of the Load-stone, or Needle or pendulous Watches, yet (which was as serviceable to them) they had subtile observations, and great practice; in so much that they could not onely tell the depth of the Sea in every place, but where there were shelves of Sand, Rocks, and other obstructions to be avoided by skillful and experienced Sea-men: Besides, they were excellent Augurers, which skill they counted more necessary and beneficial then the use of Compasses, Cards, Watches, and the like; but, above the rest, they had an extraordinary Art, much to be taken notice of by Experimental Philosophers, and that was a certain Engin, which would draw in a great quantity of Air, and shoot forth Wind with a great force; this Engine in a calm, they placed behind their Ships, and in a storm, before; for it served against the raging waves, like Cannons against an hostile Army, or besieged Town; it would batter and beat the waves in pieces, were they as high as Steeples; and as soon as a breach was made, they forced their passage through, in spit even of the most furious wind, using two of those Engins at every Ship, one before, to beat off the waves, and another behind to drive it on; so that the artificial wind had the better of the natural; for, it had a greater advantage of the waves, then the natural of the Ships: the natural being above the face of the Water, could not without a down right motion enter or press into the Ships; whereas the artificial with a sideward-motion, did pierce into the bowels of the Waves: Moreover, it is to be observed, that in a great Tempest they would join their Ships in battle-aray: and when they feared Wind and Waves would be too strong for them, if they divided their Ships; they joined as many together as the compass or advantage of the places of the Liquid Element would give them leave. For, their Ships were so ingeniously contrived, that they could fasten them together as close as a Honey-comb, without waste of place; and being thus united, no Wind nor Waves were able to separate them. The Emperor's Ships, were all of Gold; but the Merchants and Skippers, of Leather; the Golden Ships were not much heavier then ours of Wood, by reason they were neatly made, and required not such thickness, neither were they troubled with Pitch, Tar, Pumps, Guns, and the like, which make our Woodden-Ships very heavy; for though they were not all of a piece, yet they were so well sodder'd, that there was no fear of Leaks, Chinks, or Clefts; and as for Guns, there was no use of them, because they had no other enemies but the Winds: But the Leather Ships were not altogether so sure, although much leighter; besides, they were pitched to keep out Water.  

Having thus prepared, and order'd their Navy, they went on in despite of Calm or Storm: And though the Lady at first fancied her self in a very sad condition, and her mind was much tormented with doubts and fears, not knowing whether this strange Adventure would tend to her safety or destruction; yet she being withal of a generous spirit, and ready wit, considering what dangers she had past, and finding those sorts of men civil and diligent attendants to her, took courage, and endeavoured to learn their language; which after she had obtained so far, that partly by some words and signs she was able to apprehend their meaning, she was so far from being afraid of them, that she thought her self not only safe, but very happy in their company: By which we may see, that Novelty discomposes the mind, but acquaintance settles it in peace and tranquility. At last, having passed by several rich Islands and Kingdoms, they went towards Paradise, which was the seat of the Emperor; and coming in sight of it, rejoiced very much; the Lady at first could perceive nothing but high Rocks, which seemed to touch the Skies; and although they appear'd not of an equal heigth, yet they seemed to be all one piece, without partitions: but at last drawing nearer, she perceived a clift, which was a part of those Rocks, out of which she spied coming forth a great number of Boats, which afar off shewed like a company of Ants, marching one after another; the Boats appeared like the holes or partitions in a Honey-comb, and when joined together, stood as close; the men were of several Complexions, but none like any of our World; and when both the Boats and Ships met, they saluted and spake to each other very courteously; for there was but one language in all that World: nor no more but one Emperor, to whom they all submitted with the greatest duty and obedience, which made them live in a continued Peace and Happiness; not acquainted with Foreign Wars or Home-bred Insurrections. The Lady now being arrived at this place, was carried out of her Ship into one of those Boats, and conveighed through the same passage (for there was no other) into that part of the World where the Emperor did reside; which part was very pleasant, and of a mild temper: Within it self it was divided by a great number of vast and large Rivers, all ebbing and flowing, into several Islands of unequal distance from each other, which in most parts were as pleasant, healthful, rich, and fruitful, as Nature could make them; and, as I mentioned before, secure from all Foreign Invasions, by reason there was but one way to enter, and that like a Labyrinth, so winding and turning among the Rocks, that no other Vessels but small Boats, could pass, carrying not above three passengers at a time: On each side all along the narrow and winding River, there were several Cities, some of Marble, some of Alabaster, some of Agat, some of Amber, some of Coral, and some of other precious materials not known in our world; all which after the Lady had passed, she came to the Imperial City, named Paradise, which appeared in form like several Islands; for, Rivers did run betwixt every street, which together with the Bridges, whereof there was a great number, were all paved. The City it self was built of Gold; and their Architectures were noble, stately, and magnificent, not like our Modern, but like those in the Romans time; for, our Modern Buildings are like those Houses which Children use to make of Cards, one story above another, fitter for Birds, then Men; but theirs were more Large, and Broad, then high; the highest of them did not exceed two stories, besides those rooms that were under-ground, as Cellars, and other Offices. The Emperor's Palace stood upon an indifferent ascent from the Imperial City; at the top of which ascent was a broad Arch, supported by several Pillars, which went round the Palace, and contained four of our English miles in compass: within the Arch stood the Emperor's Guard, which consisted of several sorts of Men; at every half mile, was a Gate to enter, and every Gate was of a different fashion; the first, which allowed a passage from the Imperial City into the Palace, had on either hand a Cloyster, the outward part whereof stood upon Arches sustained by Pillars, but the inner part was close: Being entered through the Gate, the Palace it self appear'd in its middle like the Isle of a Church, a mile and a half long, and half a mile broad; the roof of it was all Arched, and rested upon Pillars, so artificially placed that a stranger would lose himself therein without a Guide; at the extreme sides, that is, between the outward and inward part of the Cloyster, were Lodgings for Attendants; and in the midst of the Palace, the Emperor's own Rooms; whose Lights were placed at the top of every one, because of the heat of the Sun: the Emperor's apartment for State was no more enclosed then the rest; only an Imperial Throne was in every apartment, of which the several adornments could not be perceived until one entered, because the Pillars were so just opposite to one another, that all the adornments could not be seen at one. The first part of the Palace was, as the Imperial City, all of Gold; and when it came to the Emperors appartment, it was so rich with Diamonds, Pearls, Rubies, and the like precious Stones, that it surpasses my skill to enumerate them all. Amongst the rest, the Imperial Room of State appear'd most magnificent; it was paved with green Diamonds (for there are in that World Diamonds of all Colors) so artificially, as it seemed but of one piece; the Pillars were set with Diamonds so close, and in such a manner, that they appeared most Glorious to the sight; between every Pillar was a Bow or Arch of a certain sort of Diamonds, the like whereof our World does not afford; which being placed in every one of the Arches in several rows, seemed just like so many Rain-bows of several different colours. The roof of the Arches was of blew Diamonds, and in the midst thereof was a Carbuncle, which represented the Sun; and the Rising and Setting-Sun at the East and West-side of the Room were made of Rubies. Out of this Room there was a passage into the Emperor's Bed-Chamber, the Walls whereof were of Jet, and the Floor of black Marble; the Roof was of Mother of Pearl, where the Moon and Blazing-Stars were represented by white Diamonds, and his Bed was made of Diamonds and Carbuncles.  

No sooner was the Lady brought before the Emperor, but he conceived her to be some Goddess, and offered to worship her; which she refused, telling him, (for by that time she had pretty well learned their Language) that although she came out of another world, yet was she but a mortal. At which the Emperor rejoycing, made her his Wife, and gave her an absolute power to rule and govern all that World as she pleased. But her subjects, who could hardly be perswaded to believe her mortal, tender'd her all the Veneration and Worship due to a Deity.  

Her Accouterments after she was made Empress, was as follower: On her head she wore a Cap of Pearl, and a Half-moon of Diamonds just before it; on the top of her Crown came spreading over a broad Carbuncle, cut in the form of the Sun; her Coat was of Pearl, mixt with blew Diamonds, and fringed with red ones; her Buskins and Sandals were of green Diamonds; In her left hand she held a Buckler, to signifies the Defence of her Dominions; which Buckler was made of that sort of Diamond as has several different Colors; and being cut and made in the form of an Arch, shewed like a Rain-bow; In her right hand she carried a Spear made of white Diamond, cut like the tail of a Blazing Star, which signified that she was ready to assault those that proved her Enemies.  

None was allowed to use or wear Gold but those of the Imperial Race, which were the onely Nobles of the State; nor durst any one wear Jewels but the Emperor, the Empress and their Eldest Son; notwithstanding that they had an infinite quantity both of Gold and precious Stones in that World; for they had larger extents of Gold, then our Arabian Sands; their precious Stones were Rocks, and their Diamonds of several Colors; they used no Coyn, but all their Traffick was by exchange of several Commodities.  

Their Priests and Governors were Princes of the Imperial Blood, and made Eunuches for that purpose; and as for the ordinary sort of men in that part of the World where the Emperor resided, they were of several Complexions; not white, black, tawny, olive or ash-colored; but some appear'd of an Azure, some of a deep Purple, some of a Grass-green, some of a Scarlet, some of an Orange-color, &c. Which Colors and Complexions, whether they were made by the bare reflection of light, without the assistance of small particles; or by the help of well-ranged and order'd Atoms; or by a continual agitation of little Globules; or by some pressing and re-acting motion, I am not able to determine. The rest of the Inhabitants of that World, were men of several different sorts, shapes, figures, dispositions, and humors, as I have already made mention, heretofore; some were Bear-men, some Worm-men, some Fish- or Mear-men, otherwise called Syrens; some Bird-men, some Fly-men, some Ant-men, some Geese-men, some Spider-men, some Lice-men, some Fox-men, some Ape-men, some Jack daw-men, some Magpie-men, some Parrot-men, some Satyrs, some Gyants, and many more, which I cannot all remember; and of these several sorts of men, each followed such a profession as was most proper for the nature of their Species, which the Empress encouraged them in, especially those that had applied themselves to the study of several Arts and Sciences; for they were as ingenious and witty in the invention of profitable and useful Arts, as we are in our world, nay, more; and to that end she erected Schools, and founded several Societies. The Bear-men were to be her Experimental Philosophers, the Bird-men her Astronomers, the Fly- Worm- and Fish-men her Natural Philosophers, the Ape-men her Chemists, the Satyrs her Galenick Physicians, the Fox-men her Politicians, the Spider- and Lice-men her Mathematicians, the Jackdaw Magpie and Parrot-men her Orators and Logicians, the Gyants her Architects, &c. But before all things, she having got a sovereign power from the Emperor over all the World, desired to be informed both of the manner of their Religion and Government; and to that end she called the Priests and States men, to give her an account of either. Of the States men she inquired, first, Why they had so few Laws? To which they answered, That many Laws made many Divisions, which most commonly did breed Factions, and at last brake out into open Wars. Next, she asked, Why they preferred the Monarchical form of Government before any other? They answered, That as it was natural for one Body to have but one Head, so it was also natural for a politic body to have but one Governor; and that a Common-wealth, which had many Governors was like a Monster with many Heads. Besides, said they, a Monarchy is a divine form of Government, and agrees most with our Religion: For as there is but one God, whom we all unanimously worship and adore with one Faith; so we are resolved to have but one Emperor, to whom we all submit with one obedience.  
Then the Empress seeing that the several sorts of her Subjects had each their Churches apart, asked the Priests, whether they were of several Religions? They answered her Majesty, That there was no more but one Religion in all that World, nor no diversity of opinions in that same Religion for though there were several sorts of men, yet had they all but one opinion concerning the Worship and Adoration of God. The Empress asked them, Whether they were Jews, Turks, or Christians? We do not know, said they, what Religions those are; but we do all unanimously acknowledge, worship and adore the Onely, Omnipotent, and Eternal God, with all reverence, submission, and duty. Again, the Empress inquired, Whether they had several Forms of Worship? They answered, No: For our Devotion and Worship consists only in Prayers, which we frame according to our several Necessities, in Petitions, Humiliations, Thanksgiving, &c. Truly, replied the Empress, I thought you had been either Jews, or Turks, because I never perceived any Women in your Congregations: But what is the reason, you bar them from your religious Assemblies? It is not fit, said they, that Men and Women should be promiscuously together in time of Religious Worship; for their company hinders Devotion, and makes many, instead of praying to God, direct their Devotion to their Mistresses. But, asked the Empress, Have they no Congregation of their own, to perform the duties of Divine Worship, as well as Men? No, answered they: but they stay at home, and say their Prayers by themselves in their Closets. Then the Empress desired to know the reason why the Priests and Governors of their World were made Eunuchs? They answer'd, To keep them from Marriage: For Women and Children most commonly make disturbance both in Church and State. But, said she, Women and Children have no Employment in Church or State. 'Tis true, answer'd they; but, although they are not admitted to publick Employments, yet are they so prevalent with their Husbands and Parents, that many times by their importunate persuasions, they cause as much, nay, more mischief secretly, then if they had the management of public Affairs.  

The Empress having received an information of what concerned both Church and State, passed some time in viewing the Imperial Palace, where she admired much the skill and ingenuity of the Architects, and inquired of them, first, Why they built their Houses no higher then two stories from the Ground? They answered her Majesty, That the lower their Buildings were, the less were they subject either to the heat of the Sun, or Wind, Tempest, Decay, &c. Then she desired to know the reason, why they made them so thick? They answered, That, the thicker the Walls were, the warmer they were in Winter, the cooler in Summer; for their thickness kept out both the Cold and Heat. Lastly, she asked, Why they Arched their Roofs, and made so many Pillars? They replied, That Arches and Pillars, did not onely grace a Building very much, and caused it to appear Magnificent, but made it also firm and lasting.  

The Empress was very well satisfied with their answers; and after some time, when she thought that her new founded societies of the Vertuoso's had made a good progress in the several Employments she had put them upon, she caused a Convocation first of the Bird-men, and commanded them to give her a true relation of the two Celestial Bodies, viz. the Sun and Moon, which they did with all the obedience and faithfulness befitting their duty.  

The Sun, as much as they could observe, they related to be a firm or solid Stone, of a vast bigness; of color yellowish, and of an extraordinary splendor: But the Moon, they said, was of a whitish color; and although she looked dim in the presence of the Sun, yet had she her own light, and was a shining body of her self, as might be perceived by her vigorous appearance in Moon-shiny-nights; the difference only betwixt her own and the Sun's light was, that the Sun did strike his beams in a direct line; but the Moon never respected the Centre of their World in a right line, but her Center was always eccentrically. The Spots both in the Sun and Moon, as far as they were able to perceive, they affirmed to be nothing else but flaws and stains of their stony Bodies. Concerning the heat of the Sun, they were not of one opinion; some would have the Sun hot in it self, alleging an old Tradition, that it should at some time break asunder, and burn the Heavens, and consume this world into hot Embers, which, said they, could not be done, if the Sun were not fiery of it self. Others again said, This opinion could not stand with reason; for Fire being a destroyer of all things, the Sun-stone after this manner would burn up all the near adjoining Bodies: Besides, said they, Fire cannot subsist without fuel; and the Sun stone having nothing to feed on, would in a short time consume it self; wherefore they thought it more probable that the Sun was not actually hot, but only by the reflection of its light; so that its heat was an effect of its light, both being immaterial. But this opinion again was laugh at by others, and rejected as ridiculous, who thought it impossible that one immaterial should produce another; and believed that both the light and heat of the Sun proceeded from a swift Circular motion of the Ethereal Globules, which by their striking upon the Optic nerve, caused light, and their motion produced heat: But neither would this opinion hold; for, said some, then it would follow, that the sight of Animals is the cause of light; and that, were there no eyes, there would be no light; which was against all sense and reason. Thus they argued concerning the heat and light of the Sun; but, which is remarkable, none did say, that the Sun was a Globules fluid body, and had a swift Circular motion; but all agreed, It was fixt and firm like a Center, and therefore they generally called it the Sun-stone.  


Then the Empress asked them the reason, Why the Sun and Moon did often appear in different postures or shapes, as sometimes magnified, sometimes diminished; sometimes elevated, other whiles depressed; now thrown to the right, and then to the left? To which some of the Bird-men answered, That it proceeded from the various degrees of heat and cold, which are found in the Air, from whence did follow a differing density and rarity; and likewise from the vapors that are interposed, whereof those that ascend are higher and less dense then the ambient air, but those which descend are heavier and more dense. But others did with more probability affirm, that it was nothing else but the various patterns of the Air; for like as Painters do not copy out one and the same original just alike at all times; so, said they, do several parts of the Air make different patterns of the luminous Bodies of the Sun and Moon: which patterns, as several copies, the sensitive motions do figure out in the substance of our eyes.  

This answer the Empress liked much better then the former, and enquired further, What opinion they had of those Creatures that are called the motes of the Sun? To which they answered, That they were nothing else but streams of very small, rare and transparent particles, through which the Sun was represented as through a glass: for if they were not transparent, said they, they would eclipse the light of the Sun; and if not rare and of an airy substance, they would hinder Flies from flying in the Air, at least retard their flying motion: Nevertheless, although they were thinner then the thinnest vapour, yet were they not so thin as the body of air, or else they would not be perceptible by animal sight. Then the Empress asked, Whether they were living Creatures? They answered, Yes: Because they did encrease and decrease, and were nourished by the presence, and starved by the absence of the Sun.  

Having thus finished their discourse of the Sun and Moon, the Empress desired to know what Stars there were besides? But they answer'd, that they could perceive in that World none other but Blazing Stars, and from thence it had the name that it was called the Blazing-World; and these Blazing-Stars, said they, were such solid, firm and shining bodies as the Sun and Moon, not of a Globular, but of several sorts of figures: some had tails; and some, other kinds of shapes.  

After this, The Empress asked them, What kind of substance or creature the Air was? The Bird-men answered, That they could have no other perception of the Air, but by their own Respiration: For, said they, some bodies are only subject to touch, others only to sight, and others only to smell; but some are subject to none of our exterior Senses: For Nature is so full of variety, that our weak Senses cannot perceive all the various sorts of her Creatures; neither is there any one object perceptible by all our Senses, no more then several objects are by one sense. I believe you, replied the Empress; but if you can give no account of the Air, said she, you will hardly be able to inform me how Wind is made; for they say, that Wind is nothing but motion of the Air. The Bird-men answer'd, That they observed Wind to be more dense then Air, and therefore subject to the sense of Touch; but what properly Wind was, and the manner how it was made, they could not exactly tell; some said, it was caused by the Clouds falling on each other; and others, that it was produced of a hot and dry exhalation: which ascending, was driven down again by the coldness of the Air that is in the middle Region, and by reason of its lightness, could not go directly to the bottom, but was carried by the Air up and down: Some would have it a flowing Water of the Air; and others again, a flowing Air moved by the blaz of the Stars.  

But the Empress, seeing they could not agree concerning the cause of Wind, asked, Whether they could tell how Snow was made? To which they answered That according to their observation, Snow was made by a commixture of Water, and some certain extract of the Element of Fire that is under the Moon; a small portion of which extract, being mixed with Water, and beaten by Air or Wind, made a white Froth called Snow; which being after some while dissolved by the heat of the same spirit, turned to Water again. This observation amazed the Empress very much; for she had hitherto believed, That Snow was made by cold motions, and not by such an agitation or beating of a fiery extract upon water: Nor could she be persuaded to believe it until the Fish- or Mear-men had delivered their observation upon the making of Ice, which, they said, was not produced, as some hitherto conceived, by the motion of the Air, raking the Superficial of the Earth, but by some strong saline vapor arising out of the Seas, which condensed Water into Ice; and the more quantity there was of that vapor, the greater were the Mountains of Precipices of Ice; but the reason that it did not so much freeze in the Torrid Zone, or under the Ecliptic, as near or under the Poles, was, that this vapor in those places being drawn up by the Sun-beams into the middle Region of the Air, was only condensed into Water, and fell down in showers of Rain; when as, under the Poles, the heat of the Sun being not so vehement, the same vapor had no force or power to rise so high, and therefore caused so much Ice, by ascending and acting only upon the surface of water.  

This Relation confirmed partly the observation of the Bird-men concerning the cause of Snow; but since they had made mention that that same extract, which by its commixture with Water made Snow, proceeded from the Element of Fire, that is under the Moon: The Empress asked them, of what nature that Elementary Fire was; whether it was like ordinary Fire here upon Earth, or such a Fire as is within the bowels of the Earth, and as the famous Mountains Vesuvius and Etna do burn withal; or whether it was such a sort of fire, as is found in flints, &c. They answered, That the Elementary Fire, which is underneath the Sun, was not so solid as any of those mentioned fires; because it had no solid fuel to feed on; but yet it was much like the flame of ordinary fire, only somewhat more thin and fluid; for Flame, said they, is nothing else but the airy part of a fired Body.  

Lastly, the Empress asked the Bird-men of the nature of Thunder and Lightning? and whether it was not caused by roves of Ice falling upon each other? To which they answered, That it was not made that way, but by an encounter of cold and heat; so that an exhalation being kindled in the Clouds, did dash forth Lightning, and that there were so many renting of Clouds as there were Sounds and Cracking noises: But this opinion was contradicted by others, who affirmed that Thunder was a sudden and monstrous Blatz, stirred up in the Air, and did not always require a Cloud; but the Empress not knowing what they meant by Blaz (for even they themselves were not able to explain the sense of this word) liked the former better; and, to avoid hereafter tedious disputes, and have the truth of the Phenomenon's of Celestial Bodies more exactly known, commanded the Bear-men, which were her Experimental Philosophers, to observe them through such Instruments as are called Telescopes, which they did according to her Majesties Command; but these Telescopes caused more differences and divisions amongst them, then ever they had before; for some said, they perceived that the Sun stood still, and the Earth did move about it; others were of opinion, that they both did move; and others said again, that the Earth stood still, and Sun did move; some counted more Stars then others; some discovered new Stars never seen before; some fell into a great dispute with others concerning the bigness of the Stars; some said, The Moon was another World like their Terrestrial Globe, and the spots therein were Hills and Vallies; but others would have the spots to be the Terrestrial parts, and the smooth and glossie parts, the Sea: At last, the Empress commanded them to go with their Telescopes to the very end of the Pole that was joined to the World she came from, and try whether they could perceive any Stars in it: which they did; and, being returned to her Majesty, reported that they had seen three Blazing-Stars appear there, one after another in a short time, whereof two were bright, and one dim; but they could not agree neither in this observation: for some said, It was but one Star which appeared at three several times, in several places; and others would have them to be three several Stars; for they thought it impossible, that those three several appearances should have been but one Star, because every Star did rise at a certain time, and appear'd in a certain place, and did disappear in the same place: Next, It is altogether improbable, said they, That one Star should fly from place to place, especially at such a vast distance, without a visible motion; in so short a time, and appear in such different places, whereof two were quite opposite, and the third side-ways: Lastly, If it had been but one Star, said they, it would always have kept the same splendor, which it did not; for, as above mentioned, two were bright, and one was dim. After they had thus argued, the Empress began to grow angry at their Telescopes, that they could give no better Intelligence; for, said she, now I do plainly perceive, that your Glasses are false Informers, and instead of discovering the Truth, delude your Senses; Wherefore I Command you to break them, and let the Bird-men trust only to their natural eyes, and examine Celestial Objects by the motions of their own Sense and Reason.

The Bear-men replied, That it was not the fault of their Glasses, which caused such differences in their Opinions, but the sensitive motions in their Optic organs did not move alike, nor were their rational judgments always regular: To which the Empress answered, That if their Glasses were true Informers, they would rectifies their irregular Sense and Reason; But, said she, Nature has made your Sense and Reason more regular then Art has your Glasses; for they are meer deludes, and will never lead you to the knowledge of Truth; Wherefore I command you again to break them; for you may observe the progressive motions of Celestial Bodies with your natural eyes better then through Artificial Glasses. The Bear-men being exceedingly troubled at her Majesties displeasure concerning their Telescopes, kneel'd down, and in the humblest manner petitioned, that they might not be broken; for, said they, we take more delight in Artificial delusions, then in Natural truths. Besides, we shall want Employments for our Senses, and Subjects for Arguments; for, were there nothing but truth, and no falshood, there would be no occasion to dispute, and by this means we should want the aim and pleasure of our endeavors in confuting and contradicting each other; neither would one man be thought wiser then another, but all would either be alike knowing and wise, or all would be fools; wherefore we most humbly beseech your Imperial Majesty to spare our Glasses, which are our onely delight, and as dear to us as our lives.

The Empress at last consented to their request, but upon condition, that their disputes and quarrels should remain within their Schools, and cause no factions or disturbances in State, or Government. The Bear-men, full of joy, returned their most humble thanks to the Empress; and to make her amends for the displeasure which their Telescopes had occasioned, told her Majesty, that they had several other artificial Optick-Glasses, which they were sure would give her Majesty a great deal more satisfaction. Amongst the rest, they brought forth several Microscopes, by the means of which they could enlarge the shapes of little bodies, and make a Lowse appear as big as an Elephant, and a Mite as big as a Whale. First of all they shewed the Empress a gray Drone-flye, wherein they observed that the greatest part of her face, nay, of her head, consisted of two large bunches all cover'd over with a multitude of small Pearls or Hemispheres in a Trigonal order: Which Pearls were of two degrees, smaller and bigger; the smaller degree was lowermost, and looked towards the ground; the other was upward, and looked sideward, forward and backward: They were all so smooth and polished, that they were able to represent the image of any object, the number of them was in all 14000. After the view of this strange and miraculous Creature, and their several observations upon it, the Empress asked them, What they judged those little Hemispheres might be? They answered, That each of them was a perfect Eye, by reason they perceived that each was covered with a Transparent Cornea, containing a liquor within them, which resembled the watery or glassie humor of the Eye. To which the Emperess replied, That they might be glassie Pearls, and yet not Eyes; and that perhaps their Microscopes did not truly inform them. But they smilingly answered her Majesty, That she did not know the vertue of those Microscopes: for they never delude, but rectifie and inform the Senses; nay, the World, said they, would be but blind without them, as it has been in former ages before those Microscopes were invented.  
After this, they took a Charcoal, and viewing it with one of their best Microscopes, discovered in it an infinite multitude of pores, some bigger, some less; so close and thick, that they left but very little space betwixt them to be filled with a solid body; and to give her Imperial Majesty a better assurance thereof, they counted in a line of them an inch long, no less then 2700 pores; from which Observation they drew this following Conclusion, to wit, That this multitude of pores was the cause of the blackness of the Coal; for, said they, a body that has so many pores, from each of which no light is reflected, must necessarily look black, since black is nothing else but a privation of light, or a want of reflection. But the Empress replied, That if all Colours were made by reflection of light, and that Black was as much a colour as any other colour; then certainly they contradicted themselves in saying that black was made by want of reflection. However, not to interrupt your Microscopical Inspections, said she, let us see how Vegetables appear through your Glasses; whereupon they took a Nettle, and by the vertue of the Microscope, discovered that underneath the points of the Nettle there were certain little bags orbladders, containing a poysonous liquor, and when the points had made way into the interior parts of the skin, they like Syringe-pipes served to conveigh that same liquor into them. To which Observation the Empress replied, That if there were such poyson in Nettles, then certainly in eating of them, they would hurt us inwardly, as much as they do outwardly? But they answered, That it belonged to Physicians more then to Experimental Philosophers, to give Reasons hereof; for they only made Microscopical inspections, and related the Figures of the Natural parts of Creatures acording to the representation of their glasses.  

Lastly, They shewed the Empress a Flea, and a Lowse; which Creatures through the Microscope appear'd so terrible to her sight, that they had almost put her into a swoon; the description of all their parts would be very tedious to relate, and therefore I'le forbear it at this present. The Empress, after the view of those strangely-shaped Creatures, pitied much those that are molested with them, especially poor Beggars, which although they have nothing to live on themselves, are yet necessitated to maintain and feed of their own flesh and blood, a company of such terrible Creatures called Lice; who, instead of thanks, do reward them with pains, and torment them for giving them nourishment and food. But after the Empress had seen the shapes of these monstrous Creatures, she desired to know, Whether their Microscopes could hinder their biting, or at least shew some means how to avoid them? To which they answered, That such Arts were mechanical and below the noble study of Microscopical observations. Then the Empress asked them, Whether they had not such sorts of Glasses that could enlarge and magnifies the shapes of great Bodies as well as they had done of little ones? Whereupon they took one of their best and largest Microscopes, and endeavored to view a Whale thorow it; but alas! the shape of the Whale was so big, that its Circumference went beyond the magnifying quality of the Glass; whether the error proceeded from the Glass, or from a wrong position of the Whale against the reflection of light, I cannot certainly tell. The Empress seeing the insufficiency of those Magnifying-Glasses, that they were not able to enlarge all sorts of Objects, asked the Bear-men, whether they could not make Glasses of a contrary nature to those they had shewed her, to wit, such as instead of enlarging or magnifying the shape or figure of an Object, could contract it beneath its natural proportion: Which, in obedience to her Majesties Commands, they did; and viewing through one of the best of them, a huge and mighty Whale appear'd no bigger then a Sprat; nay, through some no bigger then a Vinegar-Eele; and through their ordinary ones, an Elephant seemed no bigger then a Flea; a Camel no bigger then a Lowse; and an Ostrich no bigger then a Mite. To relate all their Optics observations through the several sorts of their Glasses, would be a tedious work, and tire even the most patient Reader, wherefore I'le pass them by; only this was very remarkable and worthy to be taken notice of, that notwithstanding their great skil, industry and ingenuity in Experimental Philosophy, they could yet by no means contrive such Glasses, by the help of which they could spy out a Vacuum, with all its dimensions, nor Immaterial substances, Non-beings, and Mixt-beings, or such as are between something and nothing; which they were very much troubled at, hoping that yet, in time, by long study and practice, they might perhaps attain to it.  

The Bird- and Bear-men being dismissed, the Empress called both the Syrens or Fish-men, and the Worm-men, to deliver their Observations which they had made, both within the Seas, and the Earth. First, she inquired of the Fish-men whence the saltiness of the Sea did proceed? To which they answered, That there was a volatile salt in those parts of the Earth, which as a bosom contain the Waters of the Sea, which Salt being imbibed by the Sea, became fixt; and this imbibing motion was that they call'd the Ebbing and Flowing of the Sea; for, said they, the rising and swelling of the Water, is caused by those parts of the volatile Salt as are not so easily imbibed, which striving to ascend above the Water, bear it up with such a motion, as Man, or some other Animal Creature, in a violent exercise uses to take breath. This they affirmed to be the true cause both of the saltiness, and the ebbing and flowing-motion of the Sea, and not the jogging of the Earth, or the secret influence of the Moon, as some others had made the World believe.  

After this, the Empress inquired, Whether they had observed, that all Animal Creatures within the Seas and other waters, had blood? They answered, That some had blood, more or less, but some had none. In Crea-fishes and Lobsters, said they, we perceive but little blood; but in Crabs, Oysters, Cockles, &c. none at all. Then the Empress asked them, in what part of their Bodies that little blood did reside? They answered, in a small vein, which in Lobsters went through the middle of their tails, but in Crea-fishes was found in their backs: as for other sorts of Fishes, some, said they, had only blood about their Gills, and others in some other places of their Bodies; but they had not as yet observed any whose veins did spread all over their Bodies. The Empress wondring that there could be living Animals without Blood, to be better satisfied, desired the Worm-men to inform her, whether they had observed Blood in all sorts of Worms? They answered, That, as much as they could perceive, some had Blood, and some not; a Moth, said they, had no Blood at all, and a Lowse had, but like a Lobster, a little Vein along her back: Also Nits, Snails, and Maggots, as well as those that are generated out of Cheese and Fruits, as those that are produced out of Flesh, had no blood: But, replied the Empress, If those mentioned creatures have no blood, how is it possible they can live? for it is commonly said, That the life of an Animal consists in the blood, which is the seat of the Animal spirits. They answered, That blood was not a necessary propriety to the life of an Animal; and that that which was commonly called Animal spirits, was nothing else but corporeal motions proper to the nature and figure of an Animal. Then she asked both the Fish and Worm-men, whether all those Creatures that have blood, had a circulation of blood in their veins and arteries? But they answered, That it was impossible to give her Majesty an exact account thereof, by reason the circulation of blood was an interior motion, which their senses, neither of themselves, nor by the help of any Optick Instrument could perceive; but as soon as they had dissected an Animal Creature, to find out the truth thereof, the interior corporeal motions proper to that particular figure or creature, were altered. Then said the Empress, If all Animal Creatures have not blood, it is certain, they all have neither Muscles, tendons, nerves, &c. But, said she, Have you ever observed Animal Creatures that are neither flesh, nor Fish, but of an intermediate degree between both? Truly, answered both the Fish and Worm-men, We have observed several Animal Creatures that live both in Water, and on the Earth, indifferently, and if any, certainly those may be said to be of such a mixt nature, that is, partly Flesh, and partly Fish: But how is it possible, replied the Empress, that they should live both in Water, and on the Earth, since those Animals that live by the respiration of Air, cannot live within Water; and those that live in Water, cannot live by the respiration of Air, as Experience doth sufficiently witness. They answered her Majesty, That as there were different sorts of Creatures, so they had also different ways of Respirations; for Respiration, said they, is nothing else but a composition and division of parts, and the motions of nature being infinitely various, it is impossible that all Creatures should have the like motions; wherefore it was not necessary, that all Animal Creatures should be bound to live either by the Air, or by Water only, but according as Nature had ordered it convenient to their Species. The Empress seem'd very well satisfied with their answer, and desired to be further informed, Whether all Animal Creatures did continue their Species by a successive propagation of particulars, and whether in every Species the off-springs did always resemble their Generator or Producer, both in their interior and exterior Figures?

They answered, her Majesty, That some Species or sorts of Creatures, were kept up by a successive propagation of an offspring that was like the producer, but some were not. Of the first rank, said they, are all those Animals that are of different sexes, besides several others; but of the second rank are for the most part those we call Insects, whose production proceds from such causes as have no conformity or likeness with their produced Effects; as for example, Maggots bred out of Cheese, and several others generated out of Earth, Water, and the like. But said the Empress, there is some likeness between Maggots and Cheese; for Cheese has no blood, nor Maggots neither; besides, they have almost the same taste which Cheese has. This proves nothing, answered they; for Maggots have a visible, local, progressive motion, which Cheese hath not. The Empress replied, That when all the Cheese was turned into Maggots, it might be said to have local, progressive motion. They answered, That when the Cheese by its own figurative motions was changed into Maggots, it was no more Cheese. The Empress confessed that she observed Nature was infinitely various in her works, and that though the species of Creatures did continue, yet their particulars were subject to infinite changes. But since you have informed me, said she, of the various sorts and productions of Animal Creatures, I desire you to tell me what you have observed of their sensitive perceptions? Truly, answered they, Your Majesty puts a very hard question to us, and we shall hardly be able to give a satisfactory answer to it; for there are many different sorts of Creatures, which as they have all different perceptions, so they have also different organs, which our senses are not able to discover, onely in an Oystershell we have with admiration observed, that the common sensorium of the Oyster lies just as the closing of the shells, where the pressure and reaction may be perceived by the opening and shutting of the shells every tide.  

After all this, the Empress desired the Worm men to give her a true Relation how frost was made upon the Earth? To which they answered, That it was made much after the manner and description of the Fish- and Bird-men, concerning the Congelation of Water into Ice and Snow, by a commixture of saline and acid particles; which relation added a great light to the Ape-men, who were the Chemists, concerning their Chemical principles, Salt, Sulphur, and Mercury. But, said the Empress, if it be so, it will require an infinite multitude of saline particles to produce such a great quantity of Ice, Frost and Snow: besides, said she, when Snow, Ice and Frost, turn again into their former principle, I would fain know what becomes of those saline particles? But neither the Worm-men, nor the Fish- and Bird-men, could give her an answer to it.  

Then the Empress inquired of them the reason, Why Springs were not as salt as the Sea is? Also, why some did ebb and flow? To which it was answered, That the ebbing and flowing of some Springs, was caused by hollow Caverns within the Earth, where the Seawater crowding thorow, did thrust forward, and drew backward the Spring-water, according to its own way of ebbing and flowing; but others said, That it proceeded from a small proportion of saline and acid particles, which the Spring-water imbibed from the Earth; and although it was not so much as to be perceived by the sense of Taste; yet it was enough to cause an ebbing and flowing-motion. And as for the Spring- water being fresh, they gave, according to their Observation, this following reason: There is, said they, a certain heat within the Bowels of the Earth, proceeding from its swift circular motion, upon its own axe, which heat distills the rarest parts of the Earth into a fresh and insipid water, which water being through the pores of the Earth, conveighed into a place where it may break forth without resistance or obstruction, causes Springs and Fountains; and these distilled Waters within the Earth, do nourish and refresh the grosser and drier parts thereof. This Relation confirmed the Empress in the opinion concerning the motion of the Earth, and the fixedness of the Sun, as the Bird-men had informed her; and then she asked the Worm-men, whether Minerals and Vegetables were generated by the same heat that is within the Bowels of the Earth? To which they could give her no positive answer; only this they affirmed, That heat and cold were not the primary producing causes of either Vegetables or Minerals, or other sorts of Creatures, but only effects; and to prove this our assertion, said they, we have observed, that by change of some sorts of Corporeal motions, that which is now hot, will become cold; and what is now cold, will grow hot; but the hottest place of all, we find to be the Center of the Earth: Neither do we observe, that the Torrid Zone does contain so much Gold and Silver as the Temperate; nor is there great store of Iron and Lead wheresoever there is Gold; for these Metals are most found in colder Climates towards either of the Poles. This Observation, the Empress commanded them to confer with her Chemists, the Ape-men; to let them know that Gold was not produced by a violent, but a temperate degree of heat. She asked further, Whether Gold could not be made by Art? They answered, That they could not certainly tell her Majesty, but if it was possible to be done, they thought Tin, Lead, Brass, Iron and Silver, to be the fittest Metals for such an Artificial Transmutation. Then she asked them, Whether Art could produce Iron, Tin, Lead, or Silver? They answered, Not, in their opinion. Then I perceive, replayed the Empress, that your judgments are very irregular, since you believe that Gold, which is so fixt a Metal, that nothing has been found as yet which could occasion a dissolution of its interior figure, may be made by Art, and not Tin, Lead, Iron, Copper or Silver, which yet are so far weaker, and meaner Metals then Gold is. But the Worm-men excused themselves, that they were ignorant in that Art, and that such questions belonged more properly to the Ape-men, which were Her Majesties Chemists.  

Then the Empress asked them, Whether by their Sensitive perceptions they could observe the interior corporeal, figurative Motions both of Vegetables and Minerals? They answer'd, That their Senses could perceive them after they were produced, but not before; Nevertheless, said they, although the interior, figurative motions of Natural Creatures are not subject to the exterior, animal, sensitive perceptions, yet by their Rational perception they may judg of them, and of their productions if they be regular: Whereupon the Empress commanded the Bear-men to lend them some of their best Microscopes. At which the Bear- men smilingly answered her Majesty, that their Glasses would do them but little service in the bowels of the Earth, because there was no light; for, said they, our Glasses do only represent exterior objects, according to the various reflections and positions of light; and wheresoever light is wanting, the glasses will do no good. To which the Worm-men replied, that although they could not say much of refraction, reflections, inflections, and the like; yet were they not blind, even in the bowels of the Earth: for they could see the several sorts of Minerals, as also minute Animals, that lived there; which minute Animal Creatures were not blind neither, but had some kind of sensitive perception that was as serviceable to them, as sight, taste, smell, touch, hearing, &c. was to other Animal Creatures: By which it is evident, That Nature has been as bountiful to those Creatures that live underground, or in the bowels of the Earth, as to those that live upon the surface of the Earth, or in the Air, or in Water. But howsoever, proceeded the Worm-men, although there is light in the bowels of the Earth, yet your Microscopes will do but little good there, by reason those Creatures that live under ground have not such an optick sense as those that live on the surface of the Earth: wherefore, unless you had such Glasses as are proper for their perception, your Microscopes will not be any ways advantageous to them. The Empress seem'd well pleased with this answer of the Worm-men; and asked them further, Whether Minerals and all other Creatures within the Earth were colorless? At which question they could not forbear laughing; and when the Empress asked the reason why they laught? We most humbly beg your Majesties pardon, replied they; for we could not choose but laugh, when we heard of a colorless Body. Why, said the Empress, Color is only an accident, which is an immaterial thing, and has no being of it self, but in another body. Those, replied they, that informed your Majesty thus, surely their rational motions were very irregular; For how is it possible, that a Natural nothing can have a being in Nature? If it be no substance, it cannot have a being, and if no being, it is nothing; Wherefore the distinction between subsisting of it self, and subsisting in another body, is a meer nicety, and non-sense, for there is nothing in Nature that can subsist of, or by it self, (I mean singly) by reason all parts of Nature are composed in one body, and though they may be infinitely divided, commixed, and changed in their particular, yet in general, parts cannot be separated from parts as long as Nature lasts; nay, we might as probably affirm, that Infinite Nature would be as soon destroyed, as that one Atom could perish; and therefore your Majesty may firmly believe, that there is no Body without color, nor no Colour without body; for colour, figure, place, magnitude, and body, are all but one thing, without any separation or abstraction from each other.  

The Empress was so wonderfully taken with this Discourse of the Worm-men, that she not only pardoned the rudeness they committed in laughing at first at her question, but yielded a full assent to their opinion, which she thought the most rational that ever she had heard yet; and then proceeding in her questions, inquired further, whether they had observed any seminal principles within the Earth free from all dimensions and qualities, which produced Vegetables, Minerals, and the like? To which they answered, That concerning the seeds of Minerals, their sensitive perceptions had never observed any; but Vegetables had certain seeds out of which they were produced. Then she asked, whether those seeds of Vegetables lost their Species, that is, were annihilated in the production of their off-spring? To which they answered, That by an Annihilation, nothing could be produced, and that the seeds of Vegetables were so far from being annihilated in their productions, that they did rather numerously increase and multiply; for the division of one seed, said they, does produce numbers of seeds out of it self. But replied the Empress, A particular part cannot increase of it self. 'Tis true, answer'd they: but they increase not barely of themselves, but by joining and commixing with other parts, which do assist them in their productions, and by way of imitation form or figure their own parts into such or such particulars.

Then, I pray inform me, said the Empress, what disguise those seeds put on, and how they do conceal themselves in their Transmutations? They answered, That seeds did no ways disguise or conceal, but rather divulge themselves in the multiplication of their off-spring; only they did hide and conceal themselves from their sensitive perceptions so, that their figurative and productive motions were not perceptible by Animal Creatures. Again, the Empress asked them, whether there were any Non-beings within the Earth? To which they answered, That they never heard of any such thing; and that, if her Majesty would know the truth thereof, she must ask those Creatures that are called Immaterial spirits, which had a great affinity with Non-beings, and perhaps could give her a satisfactory answer to this question. Then she desired to be informed, What opinion they had of the beginning of Forms? They told her Majesty, That they did not understand what she meant by this expression; For, said they, there is no beginning in Nature, no not of Particulars; by reason Nature is Eternal and Infinite, and her particulars are subject to infinite changes and transmutations by virtue of their own Corporeal, figurative self-motions; so that there's nothing new in Nature, not properly a beginning of any thing. The Empress seem'd well satisfied with all those answers, and inquired further, Whether there was no Art used by those Creatures that live within the Earth? Yes, answered they: for the several parts of the Earth do join and assist each other in composition or framing of such or such particulars; and many times, there are factions and divisions; which cause productions of mixt Species; as, for example, weeds, instead of sweet flowres and useful fruits; but Gardeners and Husbandmen use often to decide their quarrels, and cause them to agree; which though it shews a kindness to the differing parties, yet 'tis a great prejudice to the Worms, and other Animal Creatures that live under ground; for it most commonly causes their dissolution and ruin, at best they are driven out of their habitations. What, said the Empress, are not Worms produced out of the Earth? Their production in general, answered they, is like the production of all other Natural Creatures, proceeding from the corporeal figurative motions of Nature; but as for their particular productions, they are according to the nature of their Species; some are produced out of flowers, some out of roots, some out of fruits, some out of ordinary Earth. Then they are very ungrateful Children, replied the Empress, that they feed on their own Parents which gave them life. Their life, answered they, is their own, and not their Parents; for no part or creature of Nature can either give or take away life; but parts do onely assist and join with parts, either in dissolution or production of other Parts and Creatures.  

After this, and several other Conferences, which the Empress held with the Worm-men, she dismissed them; and having taken much satisfaction in several of their Answers, encouraged them in their Studies and Observations. Then she made a Convocation of her Chemists, the Ape-men; and commanded them to give her an account of the several Transmutations which their Art was able to produce. They begun first with a long and tedious Discourse concerning the Primitive Ingredients of Natural bodies; and how, by their Art, they had found out the principles out of which they consist. But they did not all agree in their opinions; for some said, That the Principles of all Natural Bodies were the four Elements, Fire, Air, Water, Earth, out of which they were composed: Others rejected this Elementary commixture, and said, There were many Bodies out of which none of the four Elements could be extracted by any degree of Fire whatsoever; and that, on the other side, there were divers Bodies, whose resolution by Fire reduced them into more then four different Ingredients; and these affirmed, That the only principles of Natural Bodies were Salt, Sulfur, and Mercury: Others again declared, That none of the fore-mentioned could be called the True Principles of Natural Bodies; but that by their industry and pains which they had taken in the Art of Chemistry, they had discovered, that all Natural Bodies were produced but from one Principle, which was Water; for all Vegetables, Minerals, and Animals, said they, are nothing else, but simple Water distinguished into various figures by the virtue of their Seeds. But after a great many debates and contentions about this Subject, the Empress being so much tired that she was not able to hear them any longer, imposed a general silence upon them, and then declared her self in this following Discourse.  

I am too sensible of the pains you have taken in the Art of Chemistry, to discover the Principles of Natural Bodies, and wish they had been more profitably bestowed upon some other, then such experiments; for both by my own Contemplation, and the Observations which I have made by my rational & sensitive perception upon Nature, and her works, I find, that Nature is but one Infinite Self-moving Body, which by the virtue of its self-motion, is divided into Infinite parts, which parts being restless, undergo perpetual changes and transmutations by their infinite compositions and divisions. Now, if this be so, as surely, according to regular Sense and Reason, it appears no otherwise; it is in vain to look for primary Ingredients, or constitutive principles of Natural Bodies, since there is no more but one Universal Principle of Nature, to wit, self-moving Matter, which is the only cause of all natural effects. Next, I desire you to consider, that Fire is but a particular Creature, or effect of Nature, and occasions not only different effects in several Bodies, but on some Bodies has no power at all; witness Gold, which never could be brought yet to change its interior figure by the art of Fire; and if this be so, Why should you be so simple as to believe that Fire can shew you the Principles of Nature? and that either the Four Elements, or Water only, or Salt Sulphur and Mercury, all which are no more but particular effects and Creatures of Nature, should be the Primitive Ingredients or Principles of all Natural Bodies? Wherefore, I will not have you to take more pains, and waste your time in such fruitless attempts, but be wiser hereafter, and busies your selves with such Experiments as may be beneficial to the public.  

The Empress having thus declared her mind to the Ape-men, and given them better Instructions then perhaps they expected, not knowing that her Majesty had such great and able judgment in Natural Philosophy, had several conferences with them concerning Chemical Preparations, which for breviaries sake, I'le forbear to rehearse: Amongst the rest, she asked, how it came that the Imperial Race appear'd so young, and yet was reported to have lived so long; some of them two, some three, and some four hundred years? and whether it was by Nature, or a special Divine blessing? To which they answered, That there was a certain Rock in the parts of that World, which contained the Golden Sands, which Rock was hallow within, and did produce a Gum that was a hundred years before it came to its full strength and perfection; this Gum, said they, if it be held in a warm hand, will dissolve into an Oyl, the effects whereof are following: It being given every day for some certain time, to an old decayed man, in the bigness of a little Pea, will first make him spit for a week, or more; after this, it will cause Vomits of Flegm; and after that it will bring forth by vomits, humors of several colors; first of a pale yellow, then of a deep yellow, then of a green, and lastly of a black color; and each of these humors have a several taste, some are fresh, some salt, some sower, some bitter, and so forth; neither do all these Vomits make them sick, but they come out on a sudden, and unawares, without any pain or trouble to the patient: And after it hath done all these mentioned effects, and clear'd both the Stomack and several other parts of the body, then it works upon the Brain, and brings forth of the Nose such kinds of humors as it did out of the Mouth, and much after the same manner; then it will purge by stool, then by urine, then by sweat, and lastly by bleeding at the Nose, and the Emeroids; all which effects it will perform within the space of six weeks, or a little more; for it does not work very strongly, but gently, and by degrees: Lastly, when it has done all this, it will make the body break out into a thick Scab, and cause both Hair, Teeth, and Nails to come off; which scab being arrived to its full maturity, opens first along the back, and comes off all in a piece like Armour, and all this is done within the space of four months. After this the Patient is wrapt into a Cere- cloth, prepared of certain Gums and Juices, wherein he continues until the time of nine Months be expired from the first beginning of the cure, which is the time of a Childs formation in the Womb. In the mean while, his diet is nothing else but Eagles-eggs, and Hinds-milk; and after the Cere-cloth is taken away, he will appear of the age of Twenty, both in shape, and strength. The weaker sort of this Gum is sovereign in healing of wounds, and curing of slight distemper. But this is also to be observed, that none of the Imperial race does use any other drink but Lime-water, or water in which Lime-stone is immerged; their meat is nothing else but Fowl of several sorts, their recreations are many, but chiefly Hunting.  
This Relation amazed the Empress very much; for though in the World she came from, she had heard great reports of the Philosophers-stone, yet had she not heard of any that had ever found it out, which made her believe that it was but a Chymera; she called also to mind, that there had been in the same World a Man who had a little Stone which cured all kinds of Diseases outward and inward, according it was applied; and that a famous Chymist had found out a certain Liquor called Alkahest, which by the virtue of its own fire, consumed all Diseases; but she had never heard of a Medicine that could renew old Age, and render it beautiful, vigorous and strong: Nor would she have so easily believed it, had it been a medicine prepared by Art; for she knew that Art, being Natures Changeling, was not able to produce such a powerful effect; but being that the Gum did grow naturally, she did not so much scruple at it; for she knew that Nature's Works are so various and wonderful, that no particular Creature is able to trace her ways.  

The Conferences of the Chemists being finished, the Empress made an Assembly of her Galenical Physicians, her Herbalists and Anatomists; and first she enquired of her Herbalists the particular effects of several Herbs and Drugs, and whence they proceeded? To which they answered, that they could, for the most part, tell her Majesty the virtues and operations of them, but the particular causes of their effects were unknown; only thus much they could say, that their operations and virtues were generally caused by their proper inherent, corporeal, figurative motions, which being infinitely various in Infinite Nature, did produce infinite several effects. And it is observed, said they, that Herbs and Drugs are as wise in their operations, as Men in their words and actions; nay, wiser; and their effects are more certain then Men in their opinions; for though they cannot discourse like Men, yet have they Sense and Reason, as well as Men; for the discursive faculty is but a particular effect of Sense and Reason in some particular Creatures, to wit, Men, and not a principle of Nature, and argues often more folly then wisdom. The Empress asked, Whether they could not by a composition and commixture of other Drugs make them work other effects then they did, used by themselves? They answered, That they could make them produce artificial effects, but not alter their inherent, proper and particular natures.  

Then the Empress commanded her Anatomists to dissect such kinds of Creatures as are called Monsters. But they answered her Majesty, That it would be but an unprofitable and useless work, and hinder their better employments; for when we dissect dead Animals, said they, it is for no other end, but to observe what defects and distemper they had, that we may cure the like in living ones, so that all our care and industry concerns only the preservation of Mankind; but we hope your Majesty will not preserve Monsters, which are most commonly destroyed, except it be for novelty: Neither will the dissection of Monsters prevent the errors of Nature's irregular actions; for by dissecting some, we cannot prevent the production of others; so that our pains and labor will be to no purpose, unless to satisfie the vain curiosities of inquisitive men. The Empress replied, That such dissections would be very beneficial to Experimental Philosophers. If Experimental Philosophers, answer'd they, do spend their time in such useless Inspections, they waste it in vain, and have nothing but their labour for their pains.  

Lastly, her Majesty had some Conferences with the Galenick Physicians about several Diseases, and amongst the rest, desired to know the cause and nature of Apoplexies, and the spotted Plague. They answered, That a deadly Apoplexy was a dead palsie of the Brain, and the spotted Plague was a Gangrene of the Vital parts: and as the Gangrene of outward parts did strike inwardly; so the Gangrene of inward parts, did break forth outwardly: which is the cause, said they, that as soon as the spots appear, death follows; for then it is an infallible sign, that the body is throughout infected with a Gangrene, which is a spreading evil; but some Gangrenes do spread more suddenly than others, and of all sorts of Gangrenes, the Plaguy Gangrene is the most infectious; for other Gangrenes infect but the next adjoining parts of one particular body, and having killed that same Creature, go no further, but cease; when as, the Gangrene of the Plague, infects not only the adjoining parts of one particular Creature, but also those that are distant; that is, one particular body infects another, and so breeds a Universal Contagion. But the Empress being very desirous to know in what manner the Plague was propagated, and became so contagious, asked, Whether it went actually out of one body into another? To which they answered, That it was a great dispute amongst the Learned of their Profession, Whether it came by a division and composition of parts; that is, by expiration and inspiration; or whether it was caused by imitation: some Experimental Philosophers, said they, will make us believe, that by the help of their Microscopes, they have observed the Plague to be a body of little Flies like Atoms, which go out of one body into another, through the sensitive passages; but the most experienced and wisest of our society, have rejected this opinion as a ridiculous fancy, and do, for the most part, believe, that it is caused by an imitation of Parts; so that the motions of some parts which are sound, do imitate the motions of those that are infected and that by this means, the Plague becomes contagions, and spreading.  

The Empress having hitherto spent her time in the Examination of the Bird- Fish- Worm- and Ape- men, &c. and received several Intelligence from their several imployments; at last had a mind to divert her self after her serious Discourses, and therefore she sent for the Spider-men, which were her Mathematicians, the Lice-men which were here Geometricians, and the Magpie- Parrot- and Jackdaw-men, which were her Orators and Logicians. The Spider-men came first, and presented her Majesty with a table full of Mathematical points, lines, and figures of all sorts, of squares, circles, triangles, and the like; which the Empress, notwithstanding that she had a very ready wit, and quick apprehension, could not understand; but the more she endeavored to learn, the more was she confounded: Whether they did ever square the Circle, I cannot exactly tell, nor whether they could make imaginary points and lines; but this I dare say, That their points and lines were so slender, small and thin, that they seem'd next to Imaginary. The Mathematicians were in great esteem with the Empress, as being not onely the chief Tutors and Instructors in many Arts, but some of them excellent Magicians and Informers of spirits, which was the reason their Characters were so abstruse and intricate, that the Empress knew not what to make of them. There is so much to learn in your Art, said she, that I can neither spare time from other affairs to business my self in your profession; nor, if I could, do I think I should ever be able to understand your Imaginary points, lines and figures, because they are Non-beings.  

Then came the Lice-men, and endeavored to measure all things to a hairs-breadth, and weigh them to an Atom; but their weights would seldom agree, especially in the weighing of Air, which they found a task impossible to be done; at which the Empress began to be displeased, and told them, that there was neither Truth nor Justice in their Profession; and so dissolved their society.  

After this, the Empress was resolved to hear the Magpie- Parrot- and Jackdaw-men, which were her professed Orators and Logicians; whereupon one of the Parrot-men rose with great formality, and endeavored to make an Eloquent Speech before her Majesty; but before he had half ended, his arguments and divisions being so many, that they caused a great confusion in his brain, he could not go forward, but was forced to retire backward, with great disgrace both to himself, and the whole society; and although one of his brethren endeavoured to second him by another speech, yet was he as far to seek, as the former. At which the Empress appear'd not a little troubled, and told them, That they followed too much the Rules of Art, and confounded themselves with too nice formalities and distinctions; but since I know, said she, that you are a people who have naturally voluble tongues, and good memories; I desire you to consider more the subject you speak of, then your artificial periods, connexions and parts of speech, and leave the rest to your natural Eloquence; which they did, and so became very eminent Orators.  

Lastly, her Imperial Majesty being desirous to know what progress her Logicians had made in the Art of disputing, Commanded them to argue upon several Themes or Subjects; which they did; and having made a very nice discourse of Logistical terms and propositions, entered into a dispute by way of Syllogistical Arguments, through all the Figures and Modes: One began with an Argument of the first Mode of the first Figure, thus: Every Politician is wise: Every Knave is a Politician, Therefore every Knave is wise.  

Another contradicted him with a Syllogism of the second Mode of the same Figure, thus: No Politician is wise: Every Knave is a Politician, Therefore no Knave is wise.  

The third made an Argument in the third Mode of the same Figure, after this manner: Every Politician is wise: some Knaves are Politicians, Therefore some Knaves are wise.  

The Fourth concluded with a Syllogism in the fourth Mode of the same Figure, thus; No Politician is wise: some Knaves are Politicians, Therefore some Knaves are not wise.  

After this they took another subject, and one propounded this Syllogism: Every Philosopher is wise: Every Beast is wise, Therefore every Beast is a Philosopher.  

But another said that this Argument was false, therefore he contradicted him with a Syllogism of the second Figure of the fourth Mode, thus: Every Philosopher is wise: some Beasts are not wise, Therefore some Beasts are not Philosophers.  

Thus they argued, and intended to go on, but the Empress interrupted them: I have enough, said she, of your chopt Logick, and will hear no more of your Syllogisms; for it disorders my Reason, and puts my Brain on the rack; your formal argumentation are able to spoil all natural wit; and I'le have you to consider, that Art does not make Reason, but Reason makes Art; and therefore as much as Reason is above Art, so much is a natural rational discourse to be preferred before an artificial: for Art is, for the most part irregular, and disorders Men's understandings more then it rectifies them, and leads them into a Labyrinth where they'l never get out, and makes them dull and unfit for useful employments; especially your Art of Logic, which consists only in contradicting each other, in making sophismes, and obscuring Truth, instead of clearing it.  

But they replied to her Majesty, That the knowledge of Nature, that is, Natural Philosophy, would be imperfect without the Art of Logic; and that there was an improbable Truth which could no otherwise be found out then by the Art of disputing. Truly, said the Empress, I do believe that it is with Natural Philosophy, as it is with all other effects of Nature; for no particular knowledge can be perfect, by reason knowledge is dividable, as well as composable; nay, to speak properly, Nature her self cannot boast of any perfection, but God himself; because there are so many irregular motions in Nature, and 'tis but a folly to think that Art should be able to regulate them, since Art it self is, for the most part, irregular. But as for Improbable Truth I know not what your meaning is; for Truth is more then Improbability: nay, there is so much difference between Truth and Improbability, that I cannot conceive it possible how they can be joined together. In short, said she, I do no ways approve of your Profession; and though I will not dissolve your society, yet I shall never take delight in hearing you any more; wherefore confine your disputations to your Schools, lest besides the Commonwealth of Learning, they disturb also Divinity and Policy, Religion and Laws, and by that means draw an utter ruin and destruction both upon Church and State.  

After the Empress had thus finish'd the Discourses and Conferences with the mentioned societies of her Vertuoso's, she considered by her self the manner of their Religion, and finding it very defective, was troubled, that so wise and knowing a people should have no more knowledge of the Divine Truth; Wherefore she consulted with her own thoughts, whether it was possible to convert them all to her own Religion, and to that end she resolved to build Churches, and make also up a Congregation of Women, whereof she intended to be the head her self, and to instruct them in the several points of her Religion. This she had no sooner begun, but the Women, which generally had quick wits, subtle conceptions, clear understandings, and solid judgments, became, in a short time, very devout and zealous Sisters; for the Empress had an excellent gift of Preaching, and instructing them in the Articles of Faith; and by that means, she converted them not only soon, but gained an extraordinary love of all her Subjects throughout that World. But at last, pondering with her self the inconstant nature of Mankind, and fearing that in time they would grow weary, and desert the divine Truth, following their own fancies, and living according to their own desires; she began to be troubled that her labors and pains should prove of so little effect, and therefore studied all manner of ways to prevent it. Amongst the rest, she call'd to mind a Relation which the Bird-men made her once, of a Mountain that did burn in flames of fire; and thereupon did immediately send for the wisest and subtlest of her Worm-men, commanding them to discover the cause of the Eruption of that same fire; which they did; and having dived to the very bottom of the Mountain, informed her Majesty, That there was a certain sort of Stone, whose nature was such, that being whetted, it would grow excessively hot, and break forth into a flaming-fire, until it became dry, and then it ceased from burning. The Empress was glad to hear this news, and forthwith desired the Worm men to bring her some of that Stone, but be sure to keep it secret: she sent also for the Bird-men, and asked them whether they could not get her a piece of the Sun- stone? They answered, That it was impossible, unless they did spoil or lessen the light of the World: but, said they, if it please your Majesty, we can demolish one of the numerous Stars of the Sky, which the World will never miss.  

The Empress was very well satisfied with this proposal, and having thus employed these two sorts of men, in the mean while builded two Chapels one above another; the one she lined throughout with Diamonds, both Roof, Walls and Pillars; but the other she resolved to line with the Star-stone; the Fire- stone she placed upon the Diamond-lining, by reason Fire has no power on Diamonds; and when she would have that Chapel where the Fire-stone was, appear all in flame, she had by the means of Artificial pipes, water conveighed into it, which by turning the Cock, did, as out of a Fountain, spring over all the room, and as long as the Fire-stone was wet, the Chappel seemed to be all in a flaming-fire.  

The other Chapel, which was lined with the Star- stone, did onely cast a splendorous and comfortable light; both the Chapel stood upon Pillars, just in the middle of a round Cloyster, which was dark as night; neither was there any other light within them, but what came from the Fire- and Star-stone; and being every where open, allowed to all that were within the compass of the Cloyster, a free prospect into them; besides, they were so artificially contrived, that they did both move in a Circle about their own Centers, without intermission, contrary ways. In the Chapel which was lined with the Fire-stone, the Empress preached Sermons of Terror to the wicked, and told them of the punishments for their sins, to wit, That after this life they should be tormented in an everlasting Fire. But in the other Chappel lined with the Star- stone, she preached Sermons of Comfort to those that repented of their sins, and were troubled at their own wickedness: Neither did the heat of the flame in the least hinder her; for the Fire-stone did not cast so great a heat but the Empress was able to endure it, by reason the water which was poured on the Stone, by its own self-motion turned into a flaming-fire, occasioned by the natural motions of the Stone, which made the flame weaker then if it had been fed by some other kind of fuel; the other Chapel where the Star-Stone was, although it did cast a great light, yet was it without all heat, and the Empress appear'd like an Angel in it; and as that Chapel was an emblem of Hell, so this was an emblem of Heaven. And thus the Empress, by Art, and her own Ingenuity, did not only convert the Blazing-World to her own Religion, but kept them in a constant belief, without enforcement or blood-shed; for she knew well, that belief was a thing not to be forced or pressed upon the people, but to be instilled into their minds by gentle persuasions; and after this manner she encouraged them also in all other duties and employments: for Fear, though it makes people obey, yet does it not last so long, nor is it so sure a means to keep them to their duties, as Love.  

Last of all, when she saw that both Church and State now in a well-ordered and setled condition, her thoughts reflected upon the World she came from; and though she had a great desire to know the condition of the same, yet could she advise no manner of way how to gain any knowledge thereof; at last, after many serious considerations, she conceived that it was impossible to be done by any other means, then by the help of Immaterial Spirits; wherefore she made a Convocation of the most learned, witty and ingenious of all the forementioned sorts of Men, and desired to know of them, whether there were any Immaterial Spirits in their World. First, she inquired of the Worm-men, whether they had perceived some within the Earth? They answered her Majesty, That they never knew of any such Creatures; for whatsoever did dwell within the Earth, said they, was embodiment and material. Then she asked the Fly-men, whether they had observed any in the Air? for you having numerous Eyes, said she, will be more able to perceive them, than any other Creatures. To which they answered her Majesty, That although Spirits, being immaterial, could not be perceived by the Worm-men in the Earth, yet they perceived that such Creatures did lodg in the Vehicles of the Air. Then the Empress asked, Whether they could speak to them, and whether they did understand each other? The Fly-men answered, That those Spirits were always cloth'd in some sort or other of Material Garments; which Garments were their Bodies, made, for the most part, of Air; and when occasion served, they could put on any other sort of substances; but yet they could not put these substances into any form or shape, as they pleased. The Empress asked the Fly-men, whether it was possible that she could be acquainted, and have some conferences with them?  

They answered, They did verily believe she might. Hereupon the Empress commanded the Fly-men to ask some of the Spirits, Whether they would be pleased to give her a Visit? This they did; and after the Spirits had presented themselves to the Empress, (in what shapes and forms, I cannot exactly tell) after some few Complements that passed between them, the Empress told the Spirits that she questioned not, but they did know how she was a stranger in that World, and by what miraculous means she was arrived there; and since she had a great desire to know the condition of the World she came from, her request to the Spirits was, To give her some Information thereof, especially of those parts of the World where she was born, bred, and educated; as also of her particular friends and acquaintance: all which, the Spirits did according to her desire. At last, after a great many conferences and particular intelligence, which the Spirits gave the Empress, to her great satisfaction and content; she inquired after the most famous Students, Writers, and Experimental Philosophers in that World, which they gave her full relation of: amongst the rest she inquired, Whether there were none that had found out yet the Jews Cabbala? Several have endeavored it, answered the Spirits, but those that came nearest (although themselves denied it) were one Dr. Dee, and one Edward Kelly, the one representing Moses, and the other Aaron; for Kelly was to Dr.Dee, as Aaron to Moses; but yet they proved at last but meer Cheats; and were described by one of their own Country-men, a famous Poet, named Ben. Johnson, in a Play call'd,The Alchemist, where he expressed Kelly by Capt. Face, and Dee by Dr. Subtle, and their two Wives by Doll Common, and the Widow; by the Spaniard the Play, he meant the Spanish Ambassador, and by Sir Epicure Mammon, a Polish Lord. The Empress remembered that she had seen the Play, and asked the Spirits, whom he meant by the name of Ananias? some Zealous Brethren, answered they, in Holland, Germany, and several other places. Then she asked them, Who was meant by the Druggist? Truly, answered the Spirits, We have forgot, it being so long since it was made and acted. What, replied the Empress, Can Spirits forget? Yes, said the Spirits; for what is past, is only kept in memory, if it be not recorded. I did believe, said the Empress, That Spirits had no need of Memory, or Remembrance, and could not be subject to Forgetfulness. How can we, answered they, give an account of things present, if we had no Memory, but especially of things past, unrecorded, if we had no Remembrance? said the Empress, By present Knowledge and Understanding. The Spirits answered, That present Knowledge and Understanding was of actions or things present, not of past. But, said the Empress, you know what is to come, without Memory or Remembrance; and therefore you may know what is past without memory and remembrance. They answered, That their foreknowledge was only a prudent and subtle Observation made by comparing of things or actions past, with those that are present; and that Remembrance was nothing else but a Repetition of things or actions past.  

Then the Empress asked the Spirits, Whether there was a threefold Cabbala? They answered, Dee and Kelly made but a two-fold Cabbala, to wit, of the Old and New Testament, but others might not only make two or three, but threescore Cabbala's, if they pleased. The Empress asked, Whether it was a Traditional, or merely a Scriptural, or whether it was a Literal, Philosophical, or Moral Cabbala some, answered they, did believe it merely Traditional, others Scriptural, some Literal, and some Metaphorical: but the truth is, said they, 'twas partly one, and partly the other; as partly a Traditional, partly a Scriptural, partly Literal, partly Metaphorical. The Empress asked further, Whether the Cabbala was a work only of Natural Reason, or of Divine Inspiration? Many, said the Spirits, that write Cabbala's pretend to Divine Inspirations; but whether it be so, or not, it does not belong to us to judge; only this we must needs confess, that it is a work which requires a good wit, and a strong Faith, but not Natural Reason; for though Natural Reason is most persuasive, yet Faith is the chief that is required in Cabbalists.

But, said the Empress, Is there not Divine Reason, as well as there is Natural? No, answered they: for there is but a Divine Faith, and as for Reason it is only Natural; but you Mortals are so puzzled about this Divine Faith, and Natural Reason, that you do not know well how to distinguish them, but confound them both, which is the cause you have so many divine Philosophers who make a Gallimafry both of Reason and Faith. Then she asked, Whether pure Natural Philosophers were Cabbalists? They answered, No; but only your Mystical or Divine Philosophers, such as study beyond Sense and Reason. she inquired further, Whether there was any Cabbala in God, or whether God was full of Idea's? They answered, There could be nothing in God, nor could God be full of any thing, either forms or figures, but of himself; for God is the Perfection of all things, and an Inexpressible Being, beyond the conception of any Creature, either Natural or Supernatural. Then I pray inform me, said the Empress, Whether the Jews Cabbala or any other, consist in Numbers? The Spirits answered, No: for Numbers are odd, and different, and would make a disagreement in the Cabbala. But, said she again, Is it a sin then not to know or understand the Cabbala? God is so merciful, answered they, and so just, that he will never damn the ignorant, and save only those that pretend to know him and his secret Counsels by their Cabbala's; but he loves those that adore and worship him with fear and reverence, and with a pure heart. she asked further, which of these two Cabbala's was most approved, the Natural, or Theological? The Theological, answered they, is mystical, and belongs only to Faith; but the Natural belongs to Reason. Then she asked them, Whether Divine Faith was made out of Reason? No answered they, for Faith proceeds only from a Divine saving Grace, which is a peculiar Gift of God. How comes it then, replied she, that Men, even those that are of several opinions, have Faith more or less?

A Natural Belief, answered they, is not a Divine Faith. But, proceeded the Empress, How are you sure that God cannot be known? The several Opinions you Mortals have of God, answered they, are sufficient witnesses thereof. Well then, replied the Empress, leaving this inquisitive knowledge of God, I pray inform me, whether you Spirits give motion to Natural Bodies? No, answered they; but, on the contrary, Natural material bodies give Spirits motion; for we Spirits, being incorporeal, have no motion but from our Corporeal Vehicles, so that we move by the help of our Bodies, and not the Bodies by our help; for pure Spirits are immovable. If this be so, replied the Empress, How comes it then that you can move so suddenly at a vast distance? They answered, That some sorts of matter were more pure, rare, and consequently more light and agile then others; and this was the reason for their quick and sudden motions. Then the Empress asked them, Whether they could speak without a body, or bodily organs? No, said they; nor could we have any bodily sense, but only knowledge. she asked, Whether they could have Knowledge without Body? Not a Natural, answered they, but a Supernatural Knowledge, which is a far better Knowledge then a Natural. Then she asked them, Whether they had a General or Universal Knowledge? They answered, Single or particular created Spirits, have not; for not any Creature, but God Himself, can have an absolute and perfect knowledg of all things. The Empress asked them further, Whether Spirits had inward and outward parts? No, answered they; for parts only belong to bodies, not to Spirits. Again, she asked them, Whether their Vehicles were living Bodies? They are Self-moving Bodies, answered they, and therefore they must needs be living; for nothing can move it self, without it hath life. Then, said she, it must necessarily follow, that this living, Self-moving Body gives motion to the Spirit, and not the Spirit motion to the Body, as its Vehicle. You say very true, answered they, and we told you this before. Then the Empress asked them, Of what forms of Matter those Vehicles were? They said they were of several different forms; some gross and dense, and others more pure, rare, and subtitle. If you be not Material, said the Empress, how can you be Generators of all Creatures? We are no more, answered they, the Generators of material Creatures, then they are the Generators of us Spirits. Then she asked, Whether they did leave their Vehicles? No, answered they; for we being incorporeal, cannot leave or quit them: but our Vehicles do change into several forms and figures, according as occasion requires. Then the Empress desired the Spirits to tell her, Whether Man was a little World? They answered, That if a Fly or Worm was a little World, then Man was so too. she asked again, Whether our Fore-fathers had been as wise, as Men were at present, and had understood sense and reason, as well as they did now? They answered, That in former Ages they had been as wise as they are in this present, nay, wiser; for, said they, many in this age do think their Fore-fathers have been Fools, by which they prove themselves to be such. The Empress asked further, Whether there was any Plastick power in Nature? Truly, said the Spirits, Plastic power is a hard word, & signifies no more then the power of the corporeal, figurative motions of Nature. After this, the Empress desired the Spirits to inform her where the Paradise was, Whether it was in the midst of the World as a Center of pleasure? or, Whether it was the whole World; or a peculiar World by it self, as a World of Life, and not of Matter; or whether it was mixt, as a world of living animal Creatures? They answered, That Paradise was not in the world she came from, but in that world she lived in at present; and that it was the very same place where she kept her Court, and where her Palace stood, in the midst of the Imperial City. The Empress asked further, Whether in the beginning and Creation of the World, all Beasts could speak? They answered, That no Beasts could speak, but only those sorts of Creatures which were Fish-men, Bear-men, Worm-men, and the like, which could speak in the first Age, as well as they do now. she asked again, Whether they were none of those Spirits that frighted Adam out of the Paradise, at least caused him not to return thither again? They an? swerved they were not. Then she desired to be informed, whither Adam fled when he was driven out of the Paradise? Out of this World, said they, you are now Empress of, into the World you came from. If this be so, replied the Empress, then surely those Cabbalists are much out of their story, who believe the Paradise to be a world of Life only, without Matter, for this world, though it be most pleasant and fruitful, yet it is not a world of meer Immaterial life, but a world of living, Material Creatures. Without question, they are, answered the Spirits; for not all Cabbala's are true. Then the Empress asked, That since it is mentioned in the story of the Creation of the World, that Eve was tempted by the Serpent, Whether the Devil was within the Serpent, or, Whether the Serpent tempted her without the Devil? They answered, That the Devil was within the Serpent. But how came it then, replied she, that the Serpent was cursed? They answered, because the Devil was in him; for are not those men in danger of damnation which have the Devil within them, who persuades them to believe and act wickedly? The Empress asked further, Whether Light and the Heavens were all one? They answered, That that Region which contains the Lucid natural Orbs, was by Mortals named Heaven; but the Beatific Heaven, which is the Habitation of the Blessed Angels and Souls, was so far beyond it, that it could not be compared to any Natural Creature. Then the Empress asked them, Whether all Matter was fluid at first? They answered, That Matter was always as it is, and that some parts of Matter were rare, some dense, some fluid, some solid, &c. Neither was God bound to make all Matter fluid at first. she asked further, Whether Matter was immovable in it self? We have answered you before, said they, That there is no motion but in Matter; and were it not for the motion of Matter, we Spirits, could not move, nor give you any answer to your several questions. After this, the Empress asked the Spirits, Whether the Universe was made within the space of six days, or, Whether by those six days, were meant so many Decrees or Commands of God? They answered her, That the World was made by the All-powerful Decree and Command of God; but whether there were six Decrees or Commands, or fewer, or more, no Creature was able to tell.  

Then she inquired, Whether there was no mystery in Numbers? No other mystery, answered the Spirits, but reckoning or counting; for Numbers are onely marks of remembrance. But what do you think of the Number of Four, said she, which Cabbalists make such ado withal, and of the Number of Ten, when they say that Ten is all, and that all Numbers are virtually comprehended in Four? We think, answered they, that Cabbalists have nothing else to do but to trouble their heads with such useless Fancies; for naturally there is no such thing as prime or all in Numbers; nor is there any other mystery in Numbers, but what Man's fancy makes; but what Men call Prime, or All, we do not know, because they do not agree in the number of their opinion. Then the Empress asked, Whether the number of six was a symbole of Matrimony, as being made up of Male and Female, for two into three is six. If any number can be a symbole of Matrimony, answered the Spirits, it is not Six, but Two; if two may be allowed to be a Number: for the act of Matrimony is made up of two joined in one. she asked again, What they said to the number of Seven? whether it was not an Embleme of God, because Cabbalists say, That it is neither begotten, nor begets any other Number? There can be no Emblem of God, answered the Spirits; for if we do not know what God is, how can we make an Emblem of him? Nor is there any Number in God, for God is the perfection Himself; but Numbers are imperfect; and as for the begetting of numbers, it is done by Multiplication and Addition; but Substraction is as a kind of death to Numbers. If there be no mystery in Numbers, replied the Empress then it is in vain to refer to the Creation of the World to certain Numbers, as Cabbalists do. The only mystery of Numbers, answered they, concerning the Creation of the World, is, that as Numbers do multiply, so does the World. The Empress asked, how far Numbers did multiply? The Spirits answered, to Infinite. Why, said she, Infinite cannot be reckoned, nor numbered. No more, answered they, can the parts of the Universe; for God's Creation, being an Infinite action, as proceeding from an Infinite Power, could not rest upon a finite Number of Creatures, were it never so great. But leaving the mystery of Numbers, proceeded the Empress, Let me now desire you to inform me, Whether the Suns and Planets were generated by the Heavens, or Ethereal Matter? The Spirits answered, That the Stars and Planets were of the same matter which the Heavens, the Ether, and all other Natural Creatures did consist of; but whether they were generated by the Heavens or Ether, they could not tell: if they be, said they, they are not like their Parents; for the Sun, Stars, and Planets, are more splendorous then the Ether, as also more solid and constant in their motions: But put the case, the Stars and Planets were generated by the Heavens, and the Ethereal Matter; the question then would be, Out of what these are generated or produced? If these be created out of nothing, and not generated out of something, then it is probable the Sun, Stars and Planets are so too; nay, it is more probable of the Stars, and Planets, then of the Heavens, or the fluid Ether, by reason the Stars and Planets seem to be further off from Mortality, then the particular parts of the Ether; for no doubt but the parts of the Ethereal Matter, alter into several forms, which we do not perceive of the Stars and Planets. The Empress asked further, Whether they could give her information of the three principles of Man, according to the doctrine of the Platonist; as first of the Intellect, Spirit, or Divine Light. 2. Of the Soul of Man her self: and 3. Of the Image of the Soul, that is, her vital operation on the body? The Spirits answered, That they did not understand these three distinctions, but that they seem'd to corporeal sense and reason, as if they were three several bodies, or three several corporeal actions; however, said they, they are intricate conceptions of irregular Fancies. If you do not understand them, replied the Empress, how shall human Creatures do then? Many, both of your modern and ancient Philosophers, answered the Spirits, endeavor to go beyond Sense and Reason, which makes them commit absurdities; for no corporeal Creature can go beyond Sense and Reason; no not we Spirits, as long as we are in our corporeal Vehicles. Then the Empress asked them, Whether there were any Atheists in the World?

The Spirits answered, That there were no more Atheists then what Cabbalists make. she asked them further, Whether Spirits were of a or round Figure? They answered, That Figure belonged to body, but they being immaterial, had no Figure. she asked again, Whether Spirits were not like Water or Fire? They answered, that Water and Fire was material, were it the purest and most refined that ever could be; nay, were it above the Heavens: But we are no more like Water or Fire, said they, then we are like Earth; but our Vehicles are of several forms, figures and degrees of substances. Then she desired to know, Whether their Vehicles were made of Air? Yes, answered the Spirits, some of our Vehicles are of thin Air. Then I suppose, replied the Empress, That those airy Vehicles, are your corporeal Summer-suits. she asked further, Whether the Spirits had not ascending and descending-motions, as well as other Creatures? They answered, That properly there was no ascension or descension in Infinite Nature, but onely in relation to particular parts; and as for us Spirits, said they, We can neither ascend nor descend without corporeal Vehicles; nor can our Vehicles ascend or descend, but according to their several shapes and figures, for there can be no motion without body. The Empress asked them further, Whether there was not a World of Spirits, as well as there is of Material Creatures? No, answered they; for the word World implies a quantity or multitude of corporeal Creatures, but we being Immaterial, can make no World of Spirits. Then she desired to be informed when Spirits were made? We do not know, answered they, how and when we were made, nor are we much inquisitive after it; nay, if we did, it would be no benefit, neither for us, nor for you Mortals to know it. The Empress replied, That Cabbalists and Divine Philosophers said, Mens rational Souls were Immaterial, and stood as much in need of corporeal Vehicles, as Spirits did. If this be so, answered the Spirits, then you are Hermaphrodites of Nature; but your Cabbalists are mistaken, for they take the purest and subtlest parts of Matter, for Immaterial Spirits.

Then the Empress asked, When the Souls of Mortals went out of their Bodies, whether they went to Heaven or Hell; or whether, they remained in airy Vehicles? God's Justice and Mercy, answered they, is perfect, and not imperfect; but if you Mortals will have Vehicles for your Souls, and a place that is between Heaven and Hell, it must be Purgatory, which is a place of Purification, for which action Fire is more proper then Air; and so the Vehicles of those Souls that are in Purgatory, cannot be airy, but fiery; and after this rate there can be but four places for human Souls to be in, viz. Heaven, Hell, Purgatory, and this World; but as for Vehicles, they are but fancies, not real truths. Then the Empress asked them, Where Heaven and Hell was? Your Savior Christ, answered the Spirits, has informed you, that there is Heaven and Hell, but he did not tell you what, nor where they are; wherefore it is too great a presumption for you Mortals to inquire after it: If you do but strive to get into Heaven, it is enough, though you do not know where or what it is; for it is beyond your knowledge and understanding. I am satisfied, replied the Empress; and asked further, Whether there were any Figures or Characters in the Soul? They answered, Where there was no Body, there could be no Figure. Then she asked them, Whether Spirits could be naked? and whether they were of a dark, or a light color? As for our Nakedness, it is a very odd question, answered the Spirits; and we do not know what you mean by a Naked Spirit; for you judge of us as of corporeal Creatures; and as for Color, said they, it is according to our Vehicles; for Color belongs to Body, and as there is no Body that is colorless, so there is no Color that is bodiless. Then the Empress desired to be informed, Whether all Souls were made at the first Creation of the World? We know no more, answered the Spirits, of the origin of humane Souls, then we know of our Selves. she asked further, Whether humane bodies were not burdensome to humane Souls? They answered, That Bodies, made Souls active, as giving them motion; and if action was troublesome to Souls, then Bodies were so too. she asked again, Whether Souls did choose Bodies? They answered, That Platonic believed, the Souls of Lovers lived in the Bodies of their Beloved, but surely, said they, if there be a multitude of Souls in a World of Matter, they cannot miss Bodies; for as soon as a Soul is parted from one Body, it enters into another; and Souls having no motion of themselves, must of necessity be clothed or embodied with the next parts of Matter. If this be so, replied the Empress, then I pray inform me, Whether all matter be soulified? The Spirits answered, They could not exactly tell that; but if it was true, that Matter had no other motion but what came from a spiritual power, and that all matter was moving, then no soul could quit a Body, but she must, of necessity enter into another soulified Body, and then there would be two immaterial substances in one Body. The Empress asked, Whether it was not possible that there could be two Souls in one Body? As for Immaterial Souls, answered the Spirits, it is impossible; for there cannot be two Immaterials in one Inanimate Body, by reason they want parts, and place, being bodiless; but there may be numerous material Souls in one composed Body, by reason every material part has a material natural Soul; for Nature is but one Infinite self-moving, living and self-knowing body, consisting of the three degrees of inanimate, sensitive and rational Matter, so intermixt together, that no part of Nature, were it an Atom, can be without any of these three Degrees; the sensitive is the Life, the rational the Soul, and the inanimate part, the Body of Infinite Nature. The Empress was very well satisfied with this answer, and asked further, Whether souls did not give life to bodies? No, answered they; but Spirits and Divine Souls have a life of their own, which is not to be divided, being purer then a natural life; for Spirits are incorporeal, and consequently indivisible. But when the Soul is in its Vehicle, said the Empress, then methinks she is like the Sun, and the Vehicle like the Moon. No, answered they; but the Vehicle is like the Sun, and the Soul like the Moon; for the Soul hath motion from the Body, as the Moon has light from the Sun. Then the Empress asked the Spirits, Whether it was an evil Spirit that tempted Eve, and brought all the mischief upon Mankind: or, Whether it was the Serpent? They answered, That Spirits could not commit actual evils. The Empress said, they might do it by persuasions. They answered, That Persuasions were actions; But the Empress not being contented with this answer, asked, Whether there was not a supernatural Evil? The Spirits answered, That there was a Supernatural Good, which was God; but they knew of no Supernatural Evil, that was equal to God. Then she desired to know, Whether Evil Spirits were reckoned amongst the Beasts of the Field? They answer'd, That many Beasts of the field were harmless Creatures, and very serviceable for Man's use; and though some were accounted fierce and cruel, yet did they exercise their cruelty upon other Creatures, for the most part, to no other end, but to get themselves food, and to satisfies their natural appetite; but certainly, said they, you Men are more cruel to one another, then evil Spirits are to you; and as for their habitations in desolate places, we having no communion with them, can give you no certain account thereof. But what do you think, said the Empress, of good Spirits? may not they be compared to the Fowls of the Air? They answered, There were many cruel and ravenous Fowls as well in the Air, as there were fierce and cruel Beasts on Earth; so that the good are always mixt with the bad. she asked further, Whether the fiery Vehicles were a Heaven, or a Hell, or at least a Purgatory to the Souls? They answered, That if the Souls were immaterial, they could not burn, and then fire would do them no harm; and though Hell was believed to be an undecaying and unquenchable fire, yet Heaven was no fire. The Empress replied, That Heaven was a Light. Yes, said they, but not a fiery Light. Then she asked, Whether the different shapes and sorts of Vehicles, made the Souls and other Immaterial Spirits, miserable, or blessed? The Vehicles, answered they, make them neither better, nor worse; for though some Vehicles sometimes may have power over others, yet these by turns may get some power again over them, according to the several advantages and disadvantages of particular Natural parts. The Empress asked further, Whether Animal life came out of the spiritual World, and did return thither again? The Spirits answered, They could not exactly tell; but if it were so, then certainly Animal lives must leave their bodies behind them, otherwise the bodies would make the spiritual World a mixt World, that is, partly material, and partly immaterial; but the Truth is, said they, Spirits being immaterial, cannot properly make a World; for a World belongs to material, not to immaterial Creatures. If this be so, replied the Empress, then certainly there can be no world of Lives and Forms without Matter? No, answered the Spirits; nor a world of Matter without Lives and Forms; for Natural Lives and Forms cannot be immaterial, no more then Matter can be immovable. And therefore natural lives, forms and matter, are inseparable. Then the Empress asked, Whether the first Man did feed on the best sorts of the Fruits of the Earth, and the Beasts on the worst? The Spirits answered, That unless the Beasts of the field were barred out of manured fields and gardens, they would pick and choose the best Fruits as well as Men; and you may plainly observe it, said they, in Squirrels and Monkies, how they are the best Causers of Nuts and Apples; and how Birds do pick and feed in the most delicious fruits, and Worms on the best roots, and most savory herbs; by which you may see, that those Creatures live and feed better then men do, except you will say, that artificial Cookery is better and more wholesome then the natural. Again, the Empress asked, Whether the first Man gave Names to all the several sorts of Fishes in the Sea, and fresh Waters? No, answered the Spirits, for he was an Earthly, and not a Watery Creature; and therefore could not know the several sorts of Fishes. Why, replied the Empress, he was no more an Airy Creature then he was a Watery one, and yet he gave Names to the several sorts of Fowls and Birds of the Air. Fowls, answered they, are partly Airy, and partly Earthly Creatures, not only because they resemble Beasts and Men in their flesh, but because their rest and dwelling places are on Earth; for they build their Nests, lay their Eggs, and hatch their Young, not in the Air, but on the Earth. Then she asked, Whether the first Man did give Names to all the various sorts of Creatures that live on the Earth? Yes, answered they, to all those that were presented to him, or he had knowledge of, that is, to all the prime sorts; but not to every particular: for of Mankind, said they, there were but two at first; and as they did increase, so did their Names. But, said the Empress, who gave the Names to the several sorts of Fish? The posterity of Mankind, answered they. Then she inquired, Whether there were no more kinds of Creatures now, then at the first Creation? They answered, That there were no more nor fewer kinds of Creatures then there are now; but there are, without question, more particular sorts of Creatures now, then there were then. she asked again, Whether all those Creatures that were in Paradise, were also in Noah's Ark? They answered, That the principal kinds had been there, but not all the particulars. Then she would fain know, how it came, that both Spirits and Men did fall from a blessed into so miserable a state and condition as they are now in. The Spirits answered, By disobedience. The Empress asked, Whence this disobedient sin did proceed? But the Spirits desired the Empress not to ask them any such questions, because they went beyond their knowledge. Then she begged the Spirits to pardon her presumption; for, said she, It is the nature of Mankind to be inquisitive. Natural desire of knowledge, answered the Spirits, is not blamable, so you do not go beyond what your Natural Reason can comprehend. Then I'le ask no more, said the Empress, for fear I should commit some error; but one thing I cannot but acquaint you withal: What is that, said the Spirits? I have a great desire, answered the Empress, to make a Cabbala. What kind of Cabbala asked the Spirits? The Empress answered, The Jews Cabbala. No sooner had the Empress declared her Mind, but the Spirits immediately disappeared out of her sight; which startled the Empress so much, that she fell into a Trance, wherein she lay for some while; at last being come to her self again, she grew very studious, and considering with her self what might be the cause of this strange dysaster, conceived at first, that perhaps the Spirits were tired with hearing and giving answers to her Questions; but thinking by her self, That Spirits could not be tired, she imagined that this was not the true cause of their disappearing, till, after divers debates with her own thoughts, she did verily believe that the Spirits had committed some fault in their answers, and that for their punishment they were condemned to the lowest and darkest Vehicles. This belief was so fixt in her mind, that it put her into a very Melancholick humor; and then she sent both for her Fly-men and Worm-men, and declared to them the cause of her sadness. 'Tis not so much, said she, the vanishing of those Spirits that makes me Melancholick, but that I should be the cause of their miserable condition, and that those harmless Spirits should, for my sake, sink down into the black and dark abyss of the Earth. The Worm-men comforted the Empress, telling her, That the Earth was not so horrid a Dwelling, as she did imagine; for, said they, not only all Minerals and Vegetables, but several sorts of Animals can witness, that the Earth is a warm, fruitful, quiet, safe, and happy habitation; and though they want the light of the Sun, yet are they not in the dark, but there is light even within the Earth, by which those Creatures do see that dwell therein. This relation settled her Majesties mind a little; but yet she being desirous to know the Truth, where, and in what condition those Spirits were, commanded both the Fly- and Worm-men to use all labor and industry to find them out; whereupon the Worm-men straight descended into the Earth, and the Fly-men ascended into the Air. After some short time, the Worm-men returned, and told the Empress, that when they went into the Earth, they inquired of all the Creatures they met withal, Whether none of them had perceived such or such Spirits; until at last coming to the very Center of the Earth, they were truly informed, that those Spirits had stayed some time there, but at last were gone to the Antipodes on the other side of the Terrestrial Globe, diametrically opposite to theirs. The Fly-men seconded the Worm-men, assuring her Majesty, that their relation was very true; for, said they, We have rounded the Earth, and just when we came to the Antipodes, we met those Spirits in a very good condition, and acquainted them that your Majesty was very much troubled at their sudden departure, and fear'd they should be buried in the darkness of the Earth: whereupon the Spirits answered us, That they were sorry for having occasioned such sadness and trouble in your Majesty; and desired us to tell your Majesty, that they feared no darkness; for their Vehicles were of such a sort of substance as Cats eyes, Glow-worms tails, and rotten Wood, carrying their light along with them; and that they were ready to do your Majesty what service they could, in making your Cabbala. At which Relation the Empress was exceedingly glad, and rewarded both her Fly- and Worm-men bountifully.  

After some time, when the Spirits had refreshed themselves in their own Vehicles, they sent one of their nimblest Spirits, to ask the Empress, Whether she would have a Scribe, or, whether she would write the Cabbala her self? The Empress received the proffer which they made her, with all civility; and told them, that she desired a Spiritual Scribe. The Spirits answer'd, That they could dictate, but not write, except they put on a hand or arm, or else the whole body of Man. The Empress replied, How can Spirits arm themselves with gantlets of Flesh? As well, answered they, as Man can arm himself with a gantlet of steel. If it be so, said the Empress, then I will have a Scribe. Then the Spirits asked her, Whether she would have the Soul of a living or a dead Man? Why, said the Empress, can the Soul quit a living Body, and wander or travel abroad? Yes, answered they, for according to Plato's Doctrine, there is a Conversation of Souls, and the Souls of Lovers live in the Bodies of their Beloved. Then I will have, answered she, the Soul of some ancient famous Writer, either of Aristotle, Pythagoras, Plato, Epicurus, or the like. The Spirits said, That those famous Men were very learned, subtle, and ingenious Writers; but they were so wedded to their own opinions, that they would never have the patience to be Scribes. Then, said she, I'le have the Soul of one of the most famous modern Writers, as either of Galileo, Gassendus, Des Cartes, Helmont, Hobbes, H. More, &c. The Spirits answered, That they were fine ingenious Writers, but yet so self-conceited, that they would scorn to be Scribes to a Woman. But, said they, there's a Lady, the Duchess of Newcastle; which although she is not one of the most learned, eloquent, witty and ingenious, yet she is a plain and rational Writer; for the principle of her Writings, is Sense and Reason, and she will without question, be ready to do you all the service she can. That Lady then, said the Empress, will I choose for my Scribe, neither will the Emperor have reason to be jealous, she being one of my own sex. In truth, said the Spirit, Husbands have reason to be jealous of Platonic Lovers, for they are very dangerous, as being not only intimate and close, but subtitle and insinuating. You say well, replied the Empress; wherefore I pray send me the Duchess of Newcastle's Soul; which the Spirit did; and after she came to wait on the Empress, at her first arrival the Empress embraced and saluted her with a Spiritual kiss; then she asked her whether she could write? Yes, answered the Duchess's Soul, but not so intelligibly that any reader whatsoever may understand it, unless he be taught to know my Characters; for my Letters are rather like Characters, then well formed Letters. Said the Empress, you were recommended to me by an honest and ingenious Spirit. Surely, answered the Duchess, the Spirit is ignorant of my hand-writing. The truth is, said the Empress, he did not mention your hand-writing; but he informed me, that you writ Sense and Reason, and if you can but write so, that any of my Secretaries may learn your hand, they shall write it out fair and intelligible. The Duchess answered, That she questioned not but it might easily be learned in a short time.

But, said she to the Empress, What is it that your Majesty would have written? she answered, The Jews Cabbala. Then your only way for that is, said the Duchess, to have the Soul of some famous Jew; nay, if your Majesty please, I scruple not, but you may as easily have the Soul of Moses, as of any other. That cannot be, replied the Empress, for no Mortal knows where Moses is. But, said the Duchess, humane Souls are immortal; however, if this be too difficult to be obtained, you may have the Soul of one of the chief Rabbies or Sages of the Tribe of Levi, who will truly instruct you in that mystery; when as, otherwise, your Majesty will be apt to mistake, and a thousand to one, will commit gross errors. No, said the Empress, for I shall be instructed by Spirits. Alas! said the Duchess, Spirits are as ignorant as Mortals in many cases; for no created Spirits have a general or absolute knowledge, nor can they know the Thoughts of Men, much less the Mysteries of the great Creator, unless he be pleased to inspire into them the gift of Divine Knowledge. Then, I pray, said the Empress, let me have your counsel in this case. The Duchess answered, If your Majesty will be pleased to hearken to my advice, I would desire you to let that work alone; for it will be of no advantage either to you, or your people, unless you were of the Jews Religion; nay, if you were, the vulgar interpretation of the holy Scripture would be more instructive, and more easily believed, then your mystical way of interpreting it; for had it been better and more advantageous for the Salvation of the Jews, surely Moses would have saved after-Ages that labor by his own Explanation, he being not only a wise, but a very honest, zealous and religious Man: Wherefore the best way, said she, is to believe with the generality the literal sense of the Scripture, and not to make interpretations every one according to his own fancy, but to leave that work for the Learned, or those that have nothing else to do; Neither do I think, said she, that God will damn those that are ignorant therein, or suffer them to be lost for want of a Mystical interpretation of the Scripture. Then, said the Empress, I'le leave the Scripture, and make a Philosophical Cabbala. The Duchess told her, That, Sense and Reason would instruct her of a Nature as much as could be known; and as for Numbers, they were infinite; but to add non-sense to infinite, would breed a confusion, especially in Humane Understanding. Then, replied the Empress, I'le make a Moral Cabbala. The only thing, answered the Duchess, in Morality, is but, To fear God, and to love his Neighbor, and this needs no further interpretation. But then I'le make a Political Cabbala, said the Empress. The Duchess answered, That the chief and only ground in Government, was but Reward and Punishment, and required no further Cabbala; But, said she, If your Majesty were resolved to make a Cabbala, I would advise you, rather to make a Poetical or Romantically Cabbala, wherein you may use Metaphors, Allegories, Similitudes, &c. and interpret them as you please. With that the Empress thank'd the Duchess, and embracing her Soul, told her she would take her Counsel: she made her also her Favorite, and kept her sometime in that World, and by this means the Duchess came to know and give this Relation of all that passed in that rich, populous, and happy World; and after some time the Empress gave her leave to return to her Husband and Kindred into her Native World, but upon condition, that her Soul should visit her now and then; which she did: and truly their meeting did produce such an intimate friendship between them, that they became Platonic Lovers, although they were both Females.  

One time, when the Duchess her Soul was with the Empress, she seem'd to be very sad and melancholy; at which the Empress was very much troubled, and asked her the reason of her Melancholic humor? Truly, said the Duchess to the Empress, (for between dear friends there's no concealment, they being like several parts of one united body) my Melancholy proceeds from an extreme Ambition. The Empress asked, What the height of her ambition was? The Duchess answered, That neither she her self, nor no Creature in the World was able to know either the height, depth, or breadth of her Ambition; but said she, my present desire is, that I would be a great Princess. The Empress replied, so you are; for you are a Princess of the fourth or fifth Degree, for a Duke or Duchess is the highest title or honour that a subject can arrive to, as being the next to a King's Title; and as for the name of a Prince of Princess, it belongs to all that are adopted to the Crown; so that those that can add a Crown to their Arms, are Princes, and therefore a Duke is a Title above a Prince; for example, the Duke of Savoy, the Duke of Florence, the Duke of Lorrain, as also Kings Brothers, are not called by the name of Princes, but Dukes, this being the higher Title. 'Tis true, answered the Duchess, unless it be Kings Eldest sons, and they are created Princes. Yes, replied the Empress, but no sovereign does make a subject equal to himself, such as Kings eldest sons partly are: And although some Dukes be sovereigns, yet I have heard that a Prince by his Title is sovereign, by reason the Title of a Prince is more a Title of Honor, then of sovereignty; for, as I said before, it belongs to all that are adopted to the Crown. Well, said the Duchess, setting aside this dispute, my Ambition is, That I would fain be as you are, that is, an Empress of a World, and I shall never be at quiet until I be one. I love you so well, replied the Empress, that I wish with all my soul, you had the fruition of your ambitious desire, and I shall not fail to give you my best advice how to accomplish it; the best informers are the Immaterial Spirits, and they'l soon tell you, Whether it be possible to obtain your wish. But, said the Duchess, I have little acquaintance with them, for I never knew any before the time you sent for me. They know you, replied the Empress; for they told me of you, and were the means and instrument of your coming hither: Wherefore I'le confer with them, and inquire whether there be not another World, whereof you may be Empress as well as I am of this? No sooner had the Empress said this, but some Immaterial Spirits came to visit her, of whom she inquired, Whether there were but three Worlds in all, to wit, the Blazing World where she was in, the World which she came from, and the World where the Duchess lived? The Spirits answered, That there were more numerous Worlds then the Stars which appeared in these three mentioned Worlds. Then the Empress asked, Whether it was not possible that her dearest friend the Duchess of Newcastle, might be Empress of one of them? Although there be numerous, nay, infinite Worlds, answered the Spirits, yet none is without Government. But is none of these Worlds so weak, said she, that it may be surprised or conquered? The Spirits answered, That Lucian's World of Lights, had been for some time in a snuff, but of late years one Helmont had got it, who since he was Emperor of it, had so strengthened the Immortal parts thereof with mortal out-works, as it was for the present impregnable. said the Empress, If there be such an Infinite number of Worlds, I am sure, not only my friend, the Duchess, but any other might obtain one. Yes, answered the Spirits, if those Worlds were uninhabited; but they are as populous as this your Majesty governs. Why, said the Empress, it is not possible to conquer a World. No, answered the Spirits, but, for the most part, Conquerors seldom enjoy their conquest, for they being more feared then loved, most commonly come to an untimely end. If you will but direct me, said the Duchess to the Spirits, which World is easiest to be conquered, her Majesty will assist me with Means, and I will trust to Fate and Fortune; for I had rather die in the adventure of noble achievements, then live in obscure and sluggish security; since the by one, I may live in a glorious Fame; and by the other I am buried in oblivion. The Spirits answered, That the lives of Fame were like other lives; for some lasted long, and some died soon. 'Tis true, said the Duchess; but yet the shortest-liv'd Fame lasts longer then the longest life of Man. But, replied the Spirits, if occasion does not serve you, you must content your self to live without such achievements that may gain you a Fame: But we wonder, proceeded the Spirits, that you desire to be Empress of a Terrestrial World, when as you can create your self a Celestial World if you please. What, said the Empress, can any Mortal be a Creator? Yes, answered the Spirits; for every human Creature can create an Immaterial World fully inhabited by Immaterial Creatures, and populous of Immaterial subjects, such as we are, and all this within the compass of the head or scull; nay, not only so, but he may create a World of what fashion and Government he will, and give the Creatures thereof such motions, figures, forms, colors, perceptions, &c. as he pleases, and make Whirl-pools, Lights, Pressures, and Reactions, &c. as he thinks best; nay, he may make a World full of Veins, Muscles, and Nerves, and all these to move by one jolt or stroke: also he may alter that World as often as he pleases, or change it from a Natural World, to an Artificial; he may make a World of Ideas, a World of Atoms, a World of Lights, or whatsoever his Fancy leads him to. And since it is in your power to create such a World, What need you to venture life, reputation and tranquility, to conquer a gross material World? For you can enjoy no more of a material world then a particular Creature is able to enjoy, which is but a small part, considering the compass of such a world; and you may plainly observe it by your friend the Empress here, which although she possesses a whole World, yet enjoys she but a part thereof; neither is she so much acquainted with it, that she know all the places, Countries, and Dominions she Governs. The truth is, a sovereign Monarch has the general trouble; but the Subjects enjoy all the delights and pleasures in parts, for it is impossible, that a Kingdom, nay, a Country, should be enjoyed by one person at once, except he take the pains to travel into every part, and endure the inconveniences of going from one place to another? wherefore, since glory, delight, and pleasure lives but in other men opinions, and can neither add tranquility to your mind nor give ease to your body, Why should you desire to be Empress of a Material World, and be troubled with the cares that attend Government? when as by creating a World within your self, you may enjoy all both in whole and in parts, without control or opposition; and may make what World you please, and alter it when you please, and enjoy as much pleasure and delight as a World can afford you? You have converted me, said the Duchess to the Spirits, from my ambitious desire; wherefore, I'le take your advice, reject and despise all the Worlds without me, and create a World of my own. The Empress said, If I do make such a world, then I shall be Mistress of two Worlds, one within, and the other without me. That your Majesty may, said the Spirits; and so left these two Ladies to create two Worlds within themselves: who did also part from each other, until such time as they had brought their Worlds to perfection. The Duchess of Newcastle was most earnest and industrious to make her World, because she had none at present; and first she resolved to frame it according to the opinion of Thales, but she found her self so much troubled with Demons, that they would not suffer her to take her own will, but forced her to obey their orders and commands; which she being unwilling to do, left off from making a world that way, and began to frame one according to Pythagoras's Doctrine; but in the Creation thereof, she was so puzzled with numbers, how to order and compose the several parts, that she having no skill in Arithmetic, was forced also to desist from the making of that World. Then she intended to create a World according to the opinion of Plato; but she found more trouble and difficulty in that, then in the two former; for the numerous Idea's having no other motion but what was derived from her mind, whence they did flow and issue out, made it a far harder business to her, to impart motion to them, then Puppit-players have in giving motion to every several Puppit; in so much, that her patience was not able to endure the trouble which those Ideas caused her; wherefore she annihilated also that World, and was resolved to make one according to the Opinion of Epicurus; which she had no sooner begun, but the infinite Atoms made such a mist, that it quite blinded the perception of her mind; neither was she able to make a Vacuum as a receptacle for those Atoms, or a place which they might retire into; so that partly for the want of it, and of a good order and method, the confusion of those Atoms produced such strange and monstrous figures, as did more fright then delight her, and caused such a Chaos in her mind, as had almost dissolved it. At last, having with much ado cleansed and cleared her mind of these dusty and misty particles, she endeavored to create a World according to Aristotle's Opinion; but remembering that her mind, as most of the Learned hold it, was Immaterial, and that, according to Aristotle's Principle, out of Nothing, Nothing could be made; she was forced also to desist from that work, and then she fully resolved, not to take any more patterns from the Ancient Philosophers, but to follow the Opinions of the Moderns; and to that end, she endeavored to make a World according to Des Cartes Opinion; but when she had made the Ethereal Globules, and set them a moving by a strong and lively imagination, her mind became so dizzie with their extraordinary swift turning round, that it almost put her into a swoon; for her thoughts, but their constant tottering, did so stagger, as if they had all been drunk: wherefore she dissolved that World, and began to make another, according to Hobbs's Opinion; but when all the parts of this Imaginary World came to press and drive each other, they seemed like a company of Wolves that worry sheep, or like so many Dogs that hunt after Hares; and when she found a re-action equal to those pressures, her mind was so squeezed together, that her thoughts could neither move forward nor backward, which caused such an horrible pain in her head, that although she had dissolved that World, yet she could not, without much difficulty, settle her mind, and free it from that pain which those pressures and reactions had caused in it.  

At last, when the Duchess saw that no patterns would do her any good in the framing of her World; she was resolved to make a World of her own Invention, and this World was composed of sensitive and rational self-moving Matter; indeed, it was composed only of the Rational, which is the subtlest and purest degree of Matter; for as the Sensitive did move and act both to the perceptions and consistency of the body, so this degree of Matter at the same point of time (for though the degrees are mixt, yet the several parts may move several ways at one time) did move to the Creation of the Imaginary World; which World after it was made, appear'd so curious and full of variety, so well order'd and wisely govern'd, that it cannot possibly be expressed by words, nor the delight and pleasure which the Duchess took in making this World-of-her-own.  

In the mean time the Empress was also making and dissolving several Worlds in her own mind, and was so puzzled, that she could not settle in any of them; wherefore she sent for the Duchess, who being ready to wait on the Empress, carried her beloved World along with her, and invited the Empress's Soul to observe the Frame, Order and Government of it. Her Majesty was so ravished with the perception of it, that her Soul desired to live in the Duchess's World: But the Duchess advised her to make such another World in her own mind; for, said she, your Majesty's mind is full of rational corporeal motions; and the rational motions of my mind shall assist you by the help of sensitive expressions, with the best Instructions they are able to give you.  

The Empress being thus persuaded by the Duchess to make an imaginary World of her own, followed her advice; and after she had quite finished it, and framed all kinds of Creatures proper and useful for it, strengthened it with good Laws, and beautified it with Arts and Sciences; having nothing else to do, unless she did dissolve her Imaginary World, or made some alterations in the Blazing-World, she lived in; which yet she could hardly do, by reason it was so well ordered that it could not be mended; for it was governed without secret and deceiving Policy; neither was there any ambitious, factions, malicious detraction, civil distensions, or home-bred quarrels, divisions in Religion, Foreign Wars, &c. but all the people lived in a peaceful society, united Tranquility, and Religious Conformity. she was desirous to see the World the Duchess came from, and observe therein the several sovereign Governments, Laws and Customs of several Nations. The Duchess used all the means she could, to divert her from that Journey, telling her, that the World she came from, was very much disturbed with Factions, Divisions and Wars; but the Empress would not be persuaded from her design; and lest the Emperor, or any of his subjects should know of her travel, and obstruct her design; she sent for some of the Spirits she had formerly conversed withal, and inquired whether none of them could supply the place of her soul in her body at such a time, when she was gone to travel into another World? They answered, Yes, they could; for not only one, said they, but many Spirits may enter into your body, if you please. The Empress replied, she desired but one Spirit to be Vice- Roy of her body in the absence of her Soul, but it must be an honest and ingenious Spirit; and if it was possible, a female Spirit. The Spirits told her, that there was no difference of Sexes amongst them; but, said they, we will choose an honest and ingenious Spirit, and such a one as shall so resemble your soul, that neither the Emperor, nor any of his Subjects, although the most Divine, shall know whether it be your own soul, or not: which the Empress was very glad at, and after the Spirits were gone, asked the Duchess, how her body was supplied in the absence of her soul? who answered Her Majesty, That her body, in the absence of her soul, was governed by her sensitive and rational corporeal motions. Thus those two Female Souls traveled together as lightly as two thoughts into the Duchess her native World; and, which is remarkable, in a moment viewed all the parts of it, and all the actions of all the Creatures therein, especially did the Empress's Soul take much notice of the several actions of humane Creatures in all the several Nations and parts of that World, and wonder'd that for all there were so many several Nations, Governments, Laws, Religions, Opinions, &c. they should all yet so generally agree in being Ambitious, Proud, Self-conceited, Vain, Prodigal, Deceitful, Envious, Malicious, Unjust, Revengeful, Irreligious, Factious, &c. she did also admire, that not any particular State, Kingdom or Common-wealth, was contented with their own shares, but endeavored to encroach upon their Neighbors, and that their greatest glory was in Plunder and Slaughter, and yet their victory's less then their expenses, and their losses more than their gains; but their being overcome, in a manner their utter ruin: But that she wonder'd most at, was, that they should prize or value dirt more then mens lives, and vanity more then tranquility: for the Emperor of a world, said she, enjoys but a part, not the whole; so that his pleasure consists in the Opinions of others. It is strange to me, answered the Duchess, that you should say thus, being your self, an Empress of a World; and not only of a world, but of a peaceable, quiet, and obedient world. 'Tis true, replied the Empress: but although it is a peaceable and obedient world, yet the Government thereof is rather a trouble, then a pleasure; for order cannot be without industry, contrivance, and direction: besides, the Magnificent state, that great Princes keep or ought to keep, is troublesome. Then by your Majestie's discourse, said the Duchess, I perceive that the greatest happiness in all the Worlds consist in Moderation: No doubt of it, replied the Empress; and after these two souls had visited all the several places, Congregations and Assemblies both in Religion and State, the several Courts of Judicature and the like, in several Nations, the Empress said, That of all the Monarchs of the several parts of the World, she had observed the Grand-Seignior was the greatest; for his word was a Law, and his power absolute. But the Duchess pray'd the Empress to pardon her that she was of another mind; for, said she, he cannot alter Mahomets Laws and Religion; so that the Law and Church do govern the Emperor, and not the Emperor them. But, replied the Empress, he has power in some particulars; as for example, To place and displace Subjects in their particular Governments of Church and State; and having that, he has the Command both over Church and State, and none dares oppose him. 'Tis true, said the Duchess; but if it pleases your Majesty, we will go into that part of the World whence I came to wait on your Majesty, and there you shall see as powerful a Monarch as the Grand Signior; for though his Dominions are not of so large extent, yet they are much stronger, his Laws are easie and safe, and he governs so justly and wisely, that his Subjects are the happiest people of all the Nations or parts of that World. This Monarch, said the Empress, I have a great mind to see. Then they both went, and in a short time arrived into his Dominions; but coming into the Metropolitan City, the Empress's Soul observed many Gallants go into an House; and inquiring of the Duchess's Soul, what House that was? she told her, It was one of the Theatres where Comedies and Tragedies were acted. The Empress asked, Whether they were real? No, said the Duchess, they are feigned. Then the Empress desired to enter into the Theatre; and when she had seen the Play that was asked, the Duchess asked her how she liked that Recreation? I like it very well, said the Empress; but I observe that the Actors make a better show than the Spectators; and the Scenes a better than the Actors and the Musick and Dancing is more pleasant and acceptable than the Play it self; for I see, the Scenes stand for Wit, the Dancing for Humor, and the Musick is the Chorus. I am sorry, replied the Duchess, to hear your Majesty say so; for if the Wits of this part of the World should hear you, they would condemn you. What, said the Empress, would they condemn me for preferring a natural Face before a Sign-post; or a natural Humor before an artificial Dance; or Music before a true and profitable Relation? As for Relation, replied the Duchess, our Poets defies and condemn it into a Chimney-corner, fitter for old Womens Tales, than Theatres. Why, said the Empress do not your Poets Actions comply with their Judgments? For their Plays are composed of old Stories, either of Greek or Roman, or some new-found World. The Duchess answered Her Majesty, That it was true, that all or most of their Plays were taken out of old Stories; but yet they had new Actions, which being joined to old Stories, together with the addition of new Prologues, Scenes, Musick and Dancing, made new Plays.  

After this, both the Souls went to the Court, where all the Royal Family was together, attended by the chief of the Nobles of their Dominions, which made a very magnificent Show; and when the Soul of the Empress viewed the King and Queen, she seemed to be in a maze, which the Duchess's Soul perceiving, asked the Empress how she liked the King, the Queen, and all the Royal Race? she answered, that in all the Monarchs she had seen in that World, she had not found so much Majesty and Affability mixt so exactly together, that none did overshadow or eclipse the other; and as for the Queen, she said that Virtue sat Triumphant in her face, and Piety was dwelling in her heart; and that all the Royal Family seem'd to be endued with a Divine splendor: but when she had heard the King discourse, she believed that Mercury and Apollo had been his Celestial Instructors; and, my dear Lord and Husband, added the Duchess, has been his Earthly Governor. But after some short stay in the Court, the Duchess's soul grew very Melancholy; the Empress asking the cause of her sadness? she told her, That she had an extreme desire to converse with the soul of her Noble Lord and dear Husband, and that she was inpatient of a longer stay. The Empress desired the Duchess to have but patience so long, until the King, the Queen, and the Royal Family were retired, and then she would bear her Company to her Lord and Husband's Soul, who at that time lived in the Country some 112 miles off; which she did: and thus these two souls went towards those parts of the Kingdom where the Duke of Newcastle was.  

But one thing I forgot all this while, which is, That although thoughts are the natural language of Souls; yet by reason Souls cannot travel without Vehicles, they use such language as the nature and propriety of their Vehicles require, and the Vehicles of those two souls being made of the purest and finest sort of air, and of a human shape: This purity and fineness was the cause that they could neither be seen nor heard by any human Creature; when as, had they been of some grosser sort of Air, the sound of the Air's language would have been as perceptible as the blowing of Zephyrus.  

And now to return to my former Story; when the Empress's and Duchess's Soul were travelling into Nottinghamshire, (for that was the place where the Duke did reside) passing through the Forrest of Sherwood, the Empress's Soul was very much delighted with it, as being a dry, plain and woody place, very pleasant to travel in, both in Winter and Summer; for it is neither much dirty nor dusty at no time: At last they arrived at Welbeck, a House where the Duke dwell'd, surrounded all with Wood, so close and full, that the Empress took great pleasure and delight therein, and told the Duchess she never had observed more Wood in so little compass in any part of the Kingdom she had passed through. The truth is, said she, there seems to be more Wood on the Seas (she meaning the Ships) than on the Land. The Duchess told her, The reason was, that there had been a long Civil Warr in that Kingdom, in which most of the best Timber-trees and Principal Palaces were ruined and destroyed; and my dear Lord and Husband, said she, has lost by it half his Woods, besides many Houses, Land, and movable Goods; so that all the loss out of his particular Estate, did amount to above Half a Million of Pounds. I wish, said the Empress, he had some of the Gold that is in the Blazing-world, to repair his losses. The Duchess most humbly thank'd her Imperial Majesty for her kind wishes; but, said she, Wishes will not repair his ruins: however, God has given my Noble Lord and Husband great Patience, by which he bears all his losses and misfortunes. As last they enter'd into the Duke's House, an Habitation not so magnificent as useful; and when the Empress saw it, Has the Duke, said she, no other House but this? Yes, answered the Duchess, some five miles from this place he has a very fine Castle called Bolesover. That place, then, said the Empress, I desire to see. Alas, replied the Duchess, it is but a naked House, and uncatalogued of all Furniture. However, said the Empress, I may see the manner of its structure and building. That you may, replied the Duchess, and as they were thus discoursing, the Duke came out of the House into the Court, to see his Horses of Manage; whom when the Duchess's Soul perceived, she was so overjoyed, that her Aereal Vehicle became so splendorous, as if it had been enlightened by the Sun; by which we may perceive, that the passions of Souls or Spirits can alter their bodily Vehicles. Then these two Ladies Spirits went close to him, but he could not perceive them; and after the Empress had observed that Art of Manage, she was much pleased with it, and commended it as a noble pastime, and an exercise fit and proper for noble and heroic Persons. But when the Duke was gone into the house again, those two Souls followed him; where the Empress observing, that he went to the exercise of the sword, and was such an excellent and unparalleled Master thereof, she was as much pleased with that exercise, as she was with the former: But the Duchess's Soul being troubled, that her dear Lord and Husband used such a violent exercise before meat, for fear of overheating himself, without any consideration of the Empress's Soul, left her Areal Vehicle, and entered into her Lord. The Empress's Soul perceiving this, did the like: And then the Duke had three Souls in one Body; and had there been some such Souls more, the Duke would have been like the Grand-Signior in his Seraglio, onely it would have been a Platonic Seraglio. But the Duke's Soul being wise, honest, witty, complaisant and noble, afforded such delight and pleasure to the Empress's Soul by his conversation, that these two souls became enamored of each other; which the Duchess's soul perceiving, grew jealous at first, but then considering that no Adultery could be committed amongst Platonick Lovers, and that Platonism, was Divine, as being derived from Divine Plato, cast forth of her mind that Idea of Jalousie. Then the Conversation of these three souls was so pleasant, that it cannot be expressed; for the Duke's Soul entertained the Empress's Soul with Scenes, songs, Musick, witty Discourses, pleasant Recreations, and all kinds of harmless sports, so that the time passed away faster than they expected. At last a Spirit came and told the Empress, That although neither the Emperor nor any of his Subjects knew that her Soul was absent; yet the Emperor's Soul was so sad and melancholy for want of His own beloved Soul, that all the Imperial Court took notice of it. Wherefore he advised the Empress's Soul to return into the Blazing-world, into her own Body she left there; which both the Duke's and Duchess's Soul was very sorry for, and wished that, if it had been possible, the Empress's Soul might have stayed a longer time with them; but seeing it could not be otherwise, they pacified themselves. But before the Empress returned into the Blazing-world, the Duchess desired a Favour of her, to wit, That she would be pleased to make an Agreement between her Noble Lord, and Fortune. Why, said the Empress, are they Enemies? Yes, answered the Duchess, and they have been so ever since I have been his Wife: nay, I have heard my Lord say, That she hath crossed him in all things, ever since he could remember. I am sorry for that, replied the Empress; but I cannot discourse with Fortune, without the help of an Immaterial Spirit, and that cannot be done in this World; for I have no Fly nor Bird-men here, to send into the Region of the Air, where, for the most part, their Habitations are. The Duchess said, she would entreat her Lord to send an Attorney or Lawyer to plead his Cause. Fortune will bribe them, replied the Empress, and so the Duke may chance to be cast: Wherefore the best way will be, for the Duke to chuse a Friend on his side, and let Fortune choose another, and try whether by this means it be possible to compose the Difference. The Duchess said, They will never come to an agreement, unless there be a Judge or Umpire to decide the Case. A Judg, replied the Empress, is easie to be had; but to get an Impartial Judg, is a thing so difficult, that I doubt we shall hardly find one; for there is none to be had, neither in Nature, nor in Hell, but onely from Heaven; and how to get such a Divine and Celestial Judg, I cannot tell: Nevertheless, if you will go along with me into the Blazing-world, I'le try what may be done. 'Tis my duty, said the Duchess, to wait on your Majesty, and I shall most willingly do it, for I have no other interest to consider. Then the Duchess spake to the Duke concerning the difference between him and Fortune, and how it was her desire that they might be friends. The Duke answered, That for his part he had always with great industry sought her friendship, but as yet he could never obtain it, for she had always been his Enemy. However, said he, I'le try and send my two Friends, Prudence and Honesty, to plead my Cause. Then these two Friends went with the Duchess and the Empress into the Blazing-World; (for it is to be observed, that they are somewhat like Spirits, because they are Immaterial, although their actions are corporeal:) and after their arrival there, when the Empress had refreshed her self, and rejoiced with the Emperor, she sent her Fly-men for some of the Spirits, and desired their assistance, to compose the difference between Fortune, and the Duke of Newcastle. But they told her Majesty, That Fortune was so inconstant, that although she would perhaps promise to hear their Cause pleaded, yet it was a thousand to one, whether she would ever have the patience to do it: Nevertheless, upon Her Majestie's request, they tried their utmost, and at last prevailed with Fortune so far, that she chose Folly and Rashness, for her Friends, but they could not agree in chusing a Judg; until at last, with much ado, they concluded, that Truth should hear, and decide the cause. Thus all being prepared, and the time appointed, both the Empress and Duchess's Soul went to hear them plead; and when all the Immaterial Company was met, Fortune standing upon a Golden-Globe, made this following Speech:  
Noble Friends, We are met here to hear a Cause pleaded concerning the difference between the Duke of Newcastle, and my self; and though I am willing upon the persuasions of the Ambassadors of the Empress, the Immaterial Spirits, to yield to it, yet it had been fit, the Duke's Soul should be present also, to speak for her self; but since she is not here, I shall declare my self to his Wife, and his Friends, as also to my Friends, especially the Empress, to whom I shall chiefly direct my Speech. First, I desire your Imperial Majesty may know, that this Duke who complains or exclaims so much against me, hath been always my enemy; for he has preferred Honesty and Prudence before me, and slighted all my favors; nay, not only thus, but he did fight against me, and preferred his Innocence before my Power. His Friends Honesty and Prudence, said he most scornfully, are more to be regarded, than Inconstant Fortune, who is only a friend to Fools and Knaves; for which neglect and scorn, whether I have not just reason to be his enemy, your Majesty may judge your self.  

After Fortune had thus ended her Speech, the Duchess's Soul rose from her seat, and spake to the Immaterial Assembly in this manner:  

Noble Friends, I think it fit, by your leave, to answer Lady Fortune in the behalf of my Noble Lord and Husband, since he is not here himself; and since you have heard her complaint concerning the choice my Lord made of his Friends, and the neglect and disrespect he seemed to cast upon her; give me leave to answer, that, first concerning the Choice of his Friends, He has proved himself a wise man in it; and as for the disrespect and rudeness her Ladyship accuses him of, I dare say he is so much a Gentleman, that I am confident he would never slight, scorn or disrespect any of the Female Sex in all his life time; but was such a servant and Champion for them, that he ventured Life and Estate in their service; but being of an honest, as well as an honorable Nature, he could not trust Fortune with that which he preferred above his life, which was his Reputation, by reason Fortune did not side with those that were honest and honorable, but renounced them; and since he could not be of both sides, he chose to be of that which was agreeable both to his Conscience, Nature and Education; for which choice Fortune did not only declare her self his open Enemy, but fought with him in several Battels; nay, many times, hand to hand; at last, she being a Powerful Princess, and as some believe, a Deity, overcame him, and cast him into a Banishment, where she kept him in great misery, ruined his Estate, and took away from him most of his Friends; nay, even when she favored many that were against her, she still frowned on him; all which he endured with the greatest patience, and with that respect to Lady Fortune, that he did never in the least endeavor to disoblige any of her Favorites, but was only sorry that he, an honest man, could find no favor in her Court; and since he did never injure any of those she favoured, he neither was an enemy to her Ladiship, but gave her always that respect and worship which belonged to her power and dignity, and is still ready at any time honestly and prudently to serve her; he onely begs, her Ladiship would be his friend for the future, as she hath been his enemy in times past.  

As soon as the Duchess's Speech was ended, Folly and Rashness started up, and both spake so thick and fast at once, that not only the Assembly, but themselves were not able to understand each other: At which Fortune was somewhat out of countenance; and commanded them either to speak singly, or be silent: But Prudence told her Ladiship, she should command them to speak wisely, as well as singly; otherwise, said she, it were best for them not to speak at all: Which Fortune resented very ill, and told Prudence, she was too bold; and then commanded Folly to declare what she would have made known: but her Speech was so foolish, mixt with such Non-sense, that none knew what to make of it; besides, it was so tedious, that Fortune bid her to be silent; and commanded Rashness to speak for her, who began after this manner:  

Great Fortune; The Duchess of Newcastle has proved her self, according to report, a very Proud and Ambitious Lady, in presuming to answer you her own self, in this noble Assembly without your Command, in a Speech wherein she did not only contradict you, but preferred Honesty and Prudence before you; saying, That her Lord was ready to serve you honestly and prudently; which presumption is beyond all pardon; and if you allow Honesty and Prudence to be above you, none will admire, worship, or serve you; but you'l be forced to serve your self, and will be despised, neglected and scorned by all; and from a Deity, become a miserable, dirty, begging mortal in a Church-yard-Porch, or Noble-man's Gate: Wherefore to prevent such disasters, fling as many misfortunes and neglects on the Duke and Duchess of Newcastle, and their two friends, as your power is able to do; otherwise Prudence and Honesty will be the chief and only Moral Deities of Mortals.  

Rashness having thus ended her Speech, Prudence rose and declared her self in this manner:  

Beautiful Truth, Great Fortune, and you the rest of my noble Friends; I am come a great and long journey in the behalf of my dear Friend the Duke of Newcastle; not to make more wounds, but, if it be possible, to heal those that are made already. Neither do I presume to be a Deity; but my only request is, that you would be pleased to accept of my Offering, I being an humble and devout supplicant; and since no offering is more acceptable to the Gods, then the offering of Peace; in order to that, I desire to make an agreement between Fortune, and the Duke of Newcastle.  

Thus she spake, and as she was going up, up started Honesty (for she has not always so much discretion as she ought to have) and interrupted Prudence.  

I came not here, said she, to hear Fortune flattered, but to hear the Cause decided between Fortune and the Duke; neither came I hither to speak Rhetorically and Eloquently, but to propound the case plainly and truly; and I'le have you know, that the Duke, whose Cause we argue, was and is my Foster-son; for I Honesty bred him from his Childhood, and made a perpetual friendship betwixt him and Gratitude, Charity and Generosity; and put him to School to Prudence, who taught him Wisdom, and informed him in the Rules of Temperance, Patience, Justice, and the like; then I put him into the University of Honor, where he learned all Honorable Qualities, Arts, and Sciences; afterward I sent him to travel through the World of Actions, and made Observation his Governor; and in those his travels, he contracted a friendship with Experience; all which, made him fit for Heavens Blessings, and Fortunes Favors: But she hating all those that have merit and desert, became his inveterate Enemy, doing him all the mischief she could, until the God of Justice opposed Fortune's Malice, and pull'd him out of those ruins she had cast upon him: For this God's Favourites were the Dukes Champions; wherefore to be an Enemy to him, were to be an Enemy to the God of Justice: In short, the true cause of Fortunes Malice to this Duke is, that he would never flatter her; for I Honesty, did command him not to do it, or else he would be forced to follow all her inconstant ways, and obey all her unjust commands, which would cause a great reproach to him: but, on the other side, Prudence advised him not to despise Fortune's favors, for that would be an obstruction and hindrance to his worth and merit; and He to obey both our advice and counsels, did neither flatter nor despise Her; but was always humble and respectful to her so far as Honor, Honesty and Conscience would permit: all which I refer to Truth's Judgment, and expect her final Sentence.  

Fortune hearing thus Honesty's plain Speech, thought it very rude, and would not hearken to Truth's Judgment, but went away in a Passion: At which, both the Empress and Duchess were extremely troubled, that their endeavors should have no better effect: but Honesty chid the Duchess, and said, she was to be punished for desiring so much Fortune's favors; for it appears, said she, that you mistrust the gods blessings: At which the Duchess wept, answering Honesty, That she did neither mistrust the gods blessings, nor rely upon Fortune's favours; but desired onely that her Lord might have no potent Enemies. The Empress being much troubled to see her weep, told Honesty in anger, she wanted the discretion of Prudence; for though you are commended, said she, yet you are apt to commit many indiscreet actions, unless Prudence be your guide. At which reproof Prudence smiled, and Honesty was somewhat out of countenance; but they soon became very good friends: and after the Duchess's Soul had stayed some time with the Empress in the Blazing-World, she begged leave of her to return to her Lord and Husband; which the Empress granted her, upon condition she should come and visit her as often as conveniently she could, promising that she would do the same to the Duchess.  

Thus the Duchess's soul, after she had taken her leave of the Empress, as also of the Spirits, who with great civility, promised her, that they would endeavor in time to make a Peace and Agreement between Fortune and the Duke, returned with Prudence and Honesty, into her own World: But when she was just upon her departure, the Empress sent to Her, and desired that she might yet have some little conference with her before she went; which the Duchess most willingly granted her Majesty; and when she came to wait on her, the Empress told the Duchess, That she being her dear Platonic Friend, of whose just and Impartial Judgment, she had always a very great esteem; could not forbear, before she went from her, to ask her Advice concerning the Government of the Blazing-world: For, said she, although this World was very well and wisely ordered and governed at first, when I came to be Empress thereof; yet the nature of Women being much delighted with Change and Variety, after I had received an absolute Power from the Emperor, did somewhat alter the Form of Government from what I found it; but now perceiving that the World is not so quiet as it was at first, I am much troubled at it; especially there are such continual Contentions and Divisions between the Worm- Bear- and Fly-men, the Ape-men, the Satyrs, the Spider-men, and all others of such sorts, that I fear they'l break out into an open Rebellion, and cause a great disorder; and the ruin of the Government; and therefore I desire your advice and assistance, how I may order it to the best advantage, that this World may be rendered peaceable, quiet and happy, as it was before. Whereupon the Duchess answered, That since she heard by her Imperial Majesty, how well and happily the World had been governed when she first came to be Empress thereof, she would advise her Majesty to introduce the same form of Government again, which had been before; that is, to have but one soveraign, one Religion, one Law, and one Language, so that all the World might be but as one united Family, without divisions; nay, like God, and his Blessed Saints and Angels: Otherwise, said she, it may in time prove as unhappy, nay, as miserable a World as that is from which I came, wherein are more soveraigns then Worlds, and more pretended Governors then Government, more Religions then Gods, and more Opinions in those Religions then Truths; more Laws then Rights, and more Bribes then Justices; more Policies then Necessities, and more Fears then Dangers; more Covetousness then Riches, more Ambitions then Merits, more Services then Rewards, more Languages then Wit, more Controversies then Knowledge, more Reports then noble Actions, and more Gifts by partiality, then according to Merit; all which, said she, is a great misery, nay, a curse, which your blessed Blazing-World never knew, nor 'tis probable, will never know of, unless your Imperial Majesty alter the Government thereof from what it was when you began to govern it: And since your Majesty complains much of the factions of the Bear- Fish- Fly- Ape- and Worm- men, the Satyrs, Spider-men, and the like, and of their perpetual disputes and quarrels, I would advise your Majesty to dissolve all their societies; for 'tis better to be without their intelligence, then to have an unquiet and disorderly Government. The truth is, said she, wheresoever Learning is, there is most commonly also Controversie and quarreling; for there be always some that will know more, and be wiser then others: some think their Arguments come nearer to Truth, and are more rational then others; some are so wedded to their own opinions, that they'l never yield to Reason; and others, though they find their Opinions not firmly grounded upon Reason, yet, for fear of receiving some disgrace by altering them, will nevertheless maintain them against all sense and reason, which must needs breed factions in their Schools, which at last break out into open Wars, and draw sometimes an utter ruin upon a State or Government. The Empress told the Duchess, that she would willingly follow her advice; but she thought it would be an eternal disgrace to her, to alter her own Decrees, Acts, and Laws. To which the Duchess answered, That it was so far from a disgrace, as it would rather be for her Majesties eternal honor, to return from a worse to a better, and would express and declare Her to be more then ordinary wise and good; so wise, as to perceive her own errors, and so good, as not to persist in them, which few did: for which, said she, you will get a glorious fame in this World, and an Eternal Glory hereafter; and I shall pray for it so long as I live. Upon which Advice, the Empress's Soul embraced and kiss'd the Duchess's Soul with an Immaterial Kiss, and shed Immaterial Tears, that she was forced to part from her, finding her not a flattering Parasite, but a true Friend; and in truth, such was their Platonick Friendship, as these two loving Souls did often meet and rejoice in each others Conversation.  

The Second Part of the Description of the New Blazing-World  

The Empress having now ordered and settled her Government to the best advantage and quiet of her Blazing-World, lived and reigned most happily and blessedly, and received oftentimes Visits from the Immaterial Spirits, who gave her Intelligence of all such things as she desired to know, and they were able to inform her of: One time they told her, how the World she came from, was embroiled in a great War, and that most parts or Nations thereof made War against that Kingdom which was her Native Country, where all her Friends and Relations did live; at which the Empress was extremely troubled; insomuch that the Emperor perceived her grief by her tears, and examining the cause thereof, she told him that she had received Intelligence from the Spirits, that that part of the World she came from, which was her native Country, was like to be destroyed by numerous Enemies that made War against it. The Emperor being very sensible of this ill news, especially of the Trouble it caused to the Empress, endeavored to comfort her as much as possibly he could; and told her, that she might have all the assistance which the Blazing-World was able to afford. she answered, That if there were any possibility of transporting Forces out of the Blazing-World, into the World she came from, she would not fear so much the ruin thereof: but, said she, there being no probability of effecting any such thing, I know not how to shew my readiness to serve my Native Country.

The Emperor asked, Whether those Spirits that gave her Intelligence of this War, could not with all their Power and Forces, assist her against those Enemies? she answered, That Spirits could not arm themselves, nor make any use of Artificial Arms or Weapons; for their Vehicles were Natural Bodies, not Artificial: Besides, said she, the violent and strong actions of war, will never agree with Immaterial Spirits; for Immaterial Spirits cannot fight, nor make Trenches, Fortifications, and the like. But, said the Emperor, their Vehicles can; especially if those Vehicles be mens Bodies, they may be serviceable in all the actions of War. Alas, replied the Empress, that will never do; for first, said she, it will be difficult to get so many dead Bodies for their Vehicles, as to make up a whole Army, much more to make many Armies to fight with so many several Nations; nay, if this could be, yet it is not possible to get so many dead and undissolved Bodies in one Nation; and for transporting them out of other Nations, it would be a thing of great difficulty and improbability: But put the case, said she, all these difficulties could be overcome; yet there is one obstruction or hindrance which can no ways be avoided: For although those dead and undissolved Bodies did all die in one minute of time; yet before they could Rendezvous, and be put into a posture of War, to make a great and formidable Army, they would stink and dissolve; and when they came to a fight, they would molder into dust and ashes, and so leave the purer Immaterial Spirits naked: nay, were it also possible, that those dead bodies could be preserved from stinking and dissolving, yet the Souls of such Bodies would not suffer Immaterial Spirits to rule and order them, but they would enter and govern them themselves, as being the right owners thereof, which would produce a War between those Immaterial Souls, and the Immaterial Spirits in Material Bodies; all which would hinder them from doing any service in the actions of War, against the Enemies of my Native Courtney. You speak Reason, said the Emperor, and I wish with all my Soul I could advise any manner or way, that you might be able to assist it; but you having told me of your dear Platonic Friend the Duchess of Newcastle and of her good and profitable Counsels, I would desire you to send for her Soul, and conferr with her about this business.  

The Empress was very glad of this motion of the Emperor, and immediately sent for the Soul of the said Duchess, which in a minute waited on her Majesty. Then the Empress declared to her the grievance and sadness of her mind, and how much she was troubled and afflicted at the News brought her by the Immaterial Spirits, desiring the Duchess, if possible, to assist her with the best Counsels she could, that she might shew the greatness of her love and affection which she bore to her Native Courtney. Whereupon the Duchess promised her Majesty to do what lay in her power; and since it was a business of great Importance, she desired some time to consider of it; for, said she, Great Affairs require deep Considerations; which the Empress willingly allowed her. And after the Duchess had considered some little time, she desired the Empress to send some of her Sirens or Mear men, to see what passages they could find out of the Blazing-World, into the World she came from; for, said she, if there be a passage for a Ship to come out of that World into this; then certainly there may also a Ship pass thorow the same passage out of this World into that. Hereupon the Mear or Fish-men were sent out; who being many in number, employ'd all their industry, and did swim several ways; at last having found out the passage, they returned to the Empress, and told her, That as their Blazing World had but one Emperor, one Government, one Religion, and one Language, so there was but one Passage into that World, which was so little, that no Vessel bigger than a Packet-Boat could go thorow; neither was that Passage always open, but sometimes quite frozen up. At which Relation both the Empress and Duchess seemed somewhat troubled, fearing that this would perhaps be an hindrance or obstruction to their Design.  

At last the Duchess desired the Empress to send for her Ship-wrights, and all her Architects, which were Giants; who being called, the Duchess told them how some in her own World had been so ingenious, as to contrive Ships that could swim under Water, and asked, Whether they could do the like? The Giants answered, They had never heard of that Invention; nevertheless, they would try what might be done by Art, and spare no labor or industry to find it out. In the mean time, while both the Empress and Duchess were in a serious Counsel, after many debates, the Duchess desired but a few Ships to transport some of the Bird- Worm- and Bear- men: Alas! said the Empress, What can such sorts of Men do in the other World? especially so few? They will be soon destroyed, for a Musket will destroy numbers of Birds in one shot. The Duchess said, I desire your Majesty will have but a little patience, and relies upon my advice, and you shall not fail to save your own Native Country, and in a manner become a Mistress of all that World you came from. The Empress, who loved the Duchess as her own Soul, did so; the Giants returned soon after, and told her Majesty, that they had found out the Art which the Duchess had mentioned, to make such Ships as could swim under water; which the Empress and Duchess were both very glad at, and when the Ships were made ready, the Duchess told the Empress, that it was requisite that her Majesty should go her self in body, as well as in Soul; but I, said she, can onely wait on your Majesty after a Spiritual manner, that is, with my Soul. Your Soul, said the Empress, shall live with my Soul, in my Body; for I shall onely desire your Counsel and Advice.

Then said the Duchess, Your Majesty must command a great number of your Fish-men to wait on your Ships; for you know that your Ships are not made for Cannons, and therefore are no ways serviceable in War; for though by the help of your Engines, they can drive on, and your Fish-men may by the help of Chains and Ropes, draw them which way they will, to make them go on, or flye back, yet not so as to fight: And though your Ships be of Gold, and cannot be shot thorow, but onely bruised and battered; yet the Enemy will assault and enter them, and take them as Prizes; wherefore your Fishmen must do you Service instead of Cannons. But how, said the Empress, can the Fish-men do me service against an Enemy, without Cannons and all sorts of Arms? That is the reason, answered the Duchess, that I would have numbers of Fish-men, for they shall destroy all your Enemies Ships, before they can come near you. The Empress asked in what manner that could be? Thus, answered the Duchess: Your Majesty must send a number of Worm-men to the Burning-Mountains (for you have good store of them in the Blazing-World) which must get a great quantity of the Fire-stone, whose property, you know, is, that it burns so long as it is wet; and the Ships in the other World being all made of Wood, they may by that means set them all on fire; and if you can but destroy their Ships, and hinder their Navigation, you will be Mistress of all that World, by reason most parts thereof cannot live without Navigation. Besides, said she, the Fire-stone will serve you instead of Light or Torches; for you know, that the World you are going into, is dark at nights (especially if there be no Moon-shine, or if the Moon be overshadowed by Clouds) and not so full of Blazing-Stars as this World is, which make as great a light in the absence of the Sun, as the Sun doth when it is present; for that World hath but little blinking Stars, which make more shadows then light, and are only able to draw up Vapors from the Earth, but not to ratifier or clarifies them, or to convert them into serene air.  

This Advice of the Duchess was very much approved; and joyfully embraced by the Empress, who forthwith sent her Worm-men to get a good quantity of the mentioned Fire-stone. she also commanded numbers of Fish-men to wait on her under Water, and Bird-men to wait on her in the Air; and Bear- and Worm-men to wait on her in Ships, according to the Duchess's advice; and indeed the Bear-men were as serviceable to her, as the North Star; but the Bird-men would often rest themselves upon the Deck of the Ships; neither would the Empress, being of a sweet and noble Nature, suffer that they should tire or weary themselves by long flights; for though by Land they did often fly out of one Countrey into another, yet they did rest in some Woods, or on some Grounds, especially at night, when it was their sleeping time: And therefore the Empress was forced to take a great many Ships along with her, both for transporting those several sorts of her loyal and serviceable Subjects, and to carry provisions for them: Besides, she was so wearied with the Petitions of several others of her Subjects who desired to wait on her Majesty, that she could not possibly deny them all; for some would rather chuse to be drowned, then not tender their duty to her.  

Thus after all things were made fit and ready, the Empress began her Journey; I cannot properly say, she set Sail, by reason in some Part, as in the passage between the two Worlds (which yet was but short) the Ships were drawn under water by the Fish-men with Golden Chains, so that they had no need of Sails there, nor of any other Arts, but onely to keep out water from entering into the Ships, and to give or make so much Air as would serve, for breath or respiration, those Land-Animals that were in the Ships; which the Giants had so Artificially contrived, that they which were therein, found no inconvenience at all: And after they had passed the Icy Sea, the Golden Ships appeared above Water, and so went on until they came near the Kingdom that was the Empress's Native Countrey; where the Bear-men through their Telescopes discovered a great number of Ships which had beset all that Kingdom, well rigg'd and mann'd.  

The Empress before she came in sight of the Enemy, sent some of her Fish- and Bird-men to bring her intelligence of their Fleet; and hearing of their number, their station and posture, she gave order that when it was Night, her Bird-men should carry in their beeks some of the mentioned Fire-stones, with the tops thereof wetted; and the Fish-men should carry them likewise, and hold them out of the Water; for they were cut in the form of Torches or Candles, and being many thousands, made a terrible shew; for it appear'd as if all the Air and Sea had been of a Flaming-Fire; and all that were upon the Sea, or near it, did verily believe, the time of Judgment, or the Last Day was come, which made them all fall down, and Pray.  

At the break of Day, the Empress commanded those Lights to be put out, and then the Naval Forces of the Enemy perceived nothing but a Number of Ships without Sails, Guns, Arms, and other Instruments of War; which Ships seemed to swim of themselves, without any help or assistance: which sight put them into a great amaze; neither could they perceive that those Ships were of Gold, by reason the Empress had caused them all to be coloured black, or with a dark colour; so that the natural colour of the Gold could not be perceived through the artificial colour of the paint, no not by the best Telescopes. All which put the Enemies Fleet into such a fright at night, and to such wonder in the morning, or at day-time, that they know not what to judg or make of them; for they know neither what Ships they were, nor what Party they belonged to, insomuch that they had no power to stir.  

In the mean while, the Empress knowing the Colors of her own Country, sent a Letter to their General, and the rest of the chief Commanders, to let them know, that she was a great and powerful Princess, and came to assist them against their Enemies: wherefore she desired they should declare themselves, when they would have her help and assistance.  

Hereupon a Council was called, and the business debated; but there were so many cross and different Opinions, that they could not suddenly resolve what answer to send the Empress; at which she grew angry, insomuch that she resolved to return into her Blazing- World, without giving any assistance to her Countrymen: but the Duchess of Newcastle entreated her Majesty to abate her passion; for, said she, Great Councils are most commonly slow, because many men have many several Opinions: besides, every Councilor striving to be the wisest, makes long speeches, and raise many doubts, which cause retardments. If I had long-speeched Councellors, replied the Empress, I would hang them, by reason they give more Words, then Advice. The Duchess answered, That her Majesty should not be angry, but consider the differences of that and her Blazing-World; for, said she, they are not both alike; but there are grosser and duller understandings in this, than in the Blazing-World.  

At last a Messenger came out, who returned the Empress thanks for her kind proffer, but desired withal, to know from whence she came, and how, and in what manner her assistance could be serviceable to them? The Empress answered, That she was not bound to tell them whence she came; but as for the manner of her assistance, I will appear, said she, to your Navy in a splendorous Light, surrounded with Fire. The Messenger asked at what time they should expect her coming? I'le be with you, answered the Empress, about one of the Clock at night. With this report the Messenger returned; which made both the poor Councellors and Sea-men much afraid; but yet they longed for the time to behold this strange sight.  

The appointed hour being come, the Empress appear'd with Garments made of the Star-stone, and was born or supported above the Water, upon the Fish-mens heads and backs, so that she seemed to walk upon the face of the Water, and the Bird- and Fish-men carried the Fire-stone, lighted both in the Air, and above the Waters.  

Which sight, when her Country-men perceived at a distance, their hearts began to tremble; but coming something nearer, she left her Torches, and appeared onely in her Garments of Light, like an Angel, or some Deity, and all kneeled down before her, and worshipped her with all submission and reverence: But the Empress would not come nearer than at such a distance where her voice might be generally heard, by reason she would not have that any of her Accouterments should be perceived, but the splendor thereof; and when she was come so near that her voice could be heard and understood by all, she made this following Speech:  

Dear Country-men, for so you are, although you know me not; I being a Native of this Kingdom, and hearing that most part of this World had resolved to make War against it, and sought to destroy it, at least to weaken its Naval Force and Power, have made a Voyage out of another World, to lend you my assistance against your Enemies. I come not to make bargains with you, or to regard my own Interest more than your Safety; but I intend to make you the most powerful Nation of this World, and therefore I have chosen rather to quit my own Tranquility, Riches and Pleasure, than suffer you to be ruined and destroyed. All the Return I desire, is but your grateful acknowledgment, and to declare my Power, Love and Loyalty to my Native Country: for, although I am now a Great and Absolute Princess, and Empress of a whole World, yet I acknowledge, that once I was a Subject of this Kingdom, which is but a small part of this World; and therefore I will have you undoubtedly believe, that I shall destroy all your Enemies before this following Night, I mean those which trouble you by Sea; and if you have anyby Land, assure your self I shall also give you my assistance against them, and make you triumph over all that seek your Ruin and Destruction.  

Upon this Declaration of the Empress, when both the General, and all the Commanders in their several Ships, had return'd their humble and hearty Thanks to Her Majesty for so great a favor to them, she took her leave, and departed to her own Ships. But, good Lord! what several Opinions and Judgments did this produce in the minds of her Country-men! some said she was an Angel; others, she was a sorceress; some believed her a Goddess; others said the Devil deluded them in the shape of a fine Lady.  

The morning after, when the Navies were to fight, the Empress appear'd upon the face of the Waters, dress'd in her Imperial Robes, which were all of Diamonds and Carbuncles; in one hand she held a Buckler, made of one entire Carbuncle; and in the other hand a Spear of one entire Diamond; on her head she had a Cap of Diamonds, and just upon the top of the Crown, was a Starr made of the Starr-stone, mentioned heretofore; and a Half-Moon made of the same Stone, was placed on her forehead; all her other Garments were of several sorts of precious Jewels; and having given her Fish-men directions how to destroy the Enemies of her Native Country, she proceeded to effect her design. The Fish-men were to carry the Fire-stones in cases of Diamonds (for the Diamonds in the Blazing-World, are in splendor so far beyond the Diamonds of this World, as Peble-stones are to the best sort of this Worlds Diamonds) and to uncased or uncover those Fire-stones no sooner but when they were just under the Enemis Ships, or close at their sides, and then to wet them, and set their Ships on fire; which was no sooner done, but all the Enemie's Fleet was of a Flaming fire; and coming to the place where the Powder was, it streight blew them up; so that all the several Navies of the Enemies, were destroyed in a short time: which when her Countrymen did see, they all cried out with one voice, That she was an Angel sent from God to deliver them out of the hands of their Enemies: Neither would she return into the Blazing-World, until she had forced all the rest of the World to submit to that same Nation.  

In the mean time, the General of all their Naval Forces, sent to their soveraign to acquaint him with their miraculous Delivery and Conquest, and with the Empress's design of making him the most powerful Monarch of all that World. After a short time, the Empress sent her self, to the soveraign of that Nation to know in what she could be serviceable to him; who returning her many thanks, both for her assistance against his Enemies, and her kind proffer to do him further service for the good and benefit of his Nations (for he was King over several Kingdoms) sent her word, that although she did partly destroy his Enemies by Sea, yet, they were so powerful, that they did hinder the Trade and Traffic of his Dominions. To which the Empress returned this answer, That she would burn and sink all those Ships that would not pay him Tribute; and forthwith sent to all the Neighboring Nations, who had any Traffic by Sea, desiring them to pay Tribute to the King and sovereign of that Nation where she was born; But they denied it with great scorn. Whereupon, she immediately commanded her Fish-men, to destroy all strangers Ships that trafficked on the Seas; which they did according to the Empress's Command; and when the Neighboring Nations and Kingdoms perceived her power, they were so discomposed in their affairs and designs, that they knew not what to do: At last they sent to the Empress, and desired to treat with her, but could get no other conditions then to submit and pay Tribute to the said King and soveraign of her Native Country, otherwise, she was resolved to ruin all their Trade and Traffic by burning their Ships. Long was this Treaty, but in fine, they could obtain nothing, so that at last they were enforced to submit; by which the King of the mentioned Nations became absolute Master of the Seas, and consequently of that World; by reason, as I mentioned heretofore, the several Nations of that World could not well live without Traffic and Commerce, by Sea, as well as by Land.  

But after a short time, those Neighboring Nations finding themselves so much enslaved, that they were hardly able to peep out of their own Dominions without a chargeable Tribute, they all agreed to join again their Forces against the King and sovereign of the said Dominions; which when the Empress received notice of, she sent out her Fish-men to destroy, as they had done before, the remainder of all their Naval Power, by which they were soon forced again to submit, except some Nations which could live without Foreign Traffics, and some whose Trade and Traffic was merely by Land; these would no ways be Tributary to the mentioned King. The Empress sent them word, That in case they did not submit to him, she intended to fire all their Towns and Cities, and reduce them by force, to what they would not yield with a good will. But they rejected and scorned her Majesties Message, which provoked her anger so much, that she resolved to send her Bird- and Worm men thither, with order to begin first with their smaller Towns, and set them on fire (for she was loath to make more spoil then she was forced to do) and if they remain'd still obstinate in their resolutions, to destroy also their greater Cities. The only difficulty was, how to convey the Worm-men conveniently to those places; but they desired that her Majesty would but set them upon any part of the Earth of those Nations, and they could travel within the Earth as easily, and as nimbly as men upon the face of the Earth; which the Empress did according to their desire.  

But before both the Bird- and Worm-men began their journey, the Empress commanded the Bearmen to view through their Telescopes what Towns and Cities those were that would not submit; and having a full information thereof, she instructed the Bird- and Bear-men what Towns they should begin withal; in the mean while she sent to all the Princes and sovereigns of those Nations, to let them know that she would give them a proof of her Power, and check their Obstinacy by burning some of their smaller Towns; and if they continued still in their Obstinate Resolutions, that she would convert their smaller Loss into a Total Ruin. she also commanded her Bird-men to make their flight at night, lest they be perceived. At last when both the Bird and Worm-men came to the designed places, the Worm-men laid some Fire-stones under the Foundation of every House, and the Bird-men placed some at the tops of them, so that both by rain, and by some other moisture within the Earth, the stones could not fail of burning. The Bird-men in the mean time having learned some few words of their Language, told them, That the next time it did rain, their Towns would be all on fire; at which they were amazed to hear Men speak in the air; but withall they laughed when they heard them say that rain should fire their Towns; knowing that the effect of Water was to quench, not produce Fire.  

At last a rain came, and upon a sudden all their Houses appeared of a flaming Fire; and the more Water there was poured on them, the more they did flame and burn; which struck such a Fright and Terror into all the Neighboring Cities, Nations and Kingdoms, that for fear the like should happen to them, they and all the rest of the parts of that World, granted the Empress's desire, and submitted to the Monarch and sovereign of her Native Countrey, the King of Esfi; save one, which having seldom or never any rain, but only dews, which would soon be spent in a great fire, slighted her Power: The Empress being desirous to make it stoop as well as the rest, knew that every year it was watered by a flowing Tide, which lasted some Weeks; and although their Houses stood high from the ground, yet they were built upon Supporters which were fixt into the ground. Wherefore she commanded both her Bird- and Worm-men to lay some of the Fire-stones at the bottom of those Supporters, and when the Tide came in, all their Houses were of a Fire, which did so rarifie the Water, that the Tide was soon turn'd into a Vapor, and this Vapor again into Air; which caused not only a destruction of their Houses, but also a general barrenness over all their Countrey that year, and forced them to submit, as well as the rest of the World had done.  

Thus the Empress did not only save her Native Country, but made it the Absolute Monarchy of all that World; and both the effects of her Power and her Beauty, did kindle a great desire in all the greatest Princes to see her; who hearing that she was resolved to return into her own Blazing-World, they all entreated the favor, that they might wait on her Majesty before she went. The Empress sent word, That she should be glad to grant their Requests; but having no other place of Reception for them, she desired that they would be pleased to come into the open Seas with their Ships, and make a Circle of a pretty large compass, and then her own Ships should meet them, and close up the Circle, and she would present her self to the view of all those that came to see her: Which Answer was joyfully received by all the mentioned Princes, who came, some sooner, and some later, each according to the distance of his Countrey, and the length of the voyage. And being all met in the form and manner aforesaid, the Empress appeared upon the face of the Water in her Imperial Robes; in some part of her hair, near her face, she had placed some of the Starr- Stone, which added such a luster and glory to it, that it caused a great admiration in all that were present, who believed her to be some Celestial Creature, or rather an uncreated Goddess, and they all had a desire to worship her; for surely, said they, no mortal creature can have such a splendid and transcendent beauty, nor can any have so great a power as she has, to walk upon the Waters, and to destroy whatever she pleases, not only whole Nations, but a whole World.  

The Empress expressed to her own Countrymen, who were also her Interpreters to the rest of the Princes that were present, That she would give them an Entertainment at the darkest time of Night: Which being come, the Fire-Stones were lighted, which made both Air and Seas appear of a bright shining flame, insomuch that they put all Spectators into an extreme fright, who verily believed they should all be destroyed; which the Empress perceiving, caused all the Lights of the Fire-Stones to be put out, and only shewed her self in her Garments of Light. The Bird-men carried her upon their backs into the Air, and there she appear'd as glorious as the Sun. Then she was set down upon the Seas again, and presently there was heard the most melodious and sweetest Consort of Voices, as ever was heard out of the Seas, which was made by the Fish- men; this Consort was answered by another, made by the Bird-men in the Air, so that it seem'd as if Sea and Air had spoke, and answered each other by way of Singing-Dialogues, or after the manner of those Playes that are acted by singing-Voices.  

But when it was upon break of day, the Empress ended her Entertainment, and at full day-light all the Princes perceived that she went into the Ship wherein the Prince and Monarch of her Native Country was, the King of Esfi, with whom she had several Conferences; and having assured Him of the readiness of her Assistance whensoever he required it, telling Him withal, That she wanted no Intelligence, she went forth again upon the Waters, and being in the midst of the Circle made by those Ships that were present, she desired them to draw somewhat nearer, that they might hear her speak; which being done, she declared her self in this following manner:  

Great, Heroic, and Famous Monarchs, I come hither to assist the King of Esfi against his Enemies, He being unjustly assaulted by many several Nations, which would fain take away His Hereditary Rights, and Prerogatives of the Narrow Seas; at which Injustice, Heaven was much displeased, and for the Injuries He received from His Enemies, rewarded Him with an Absolute Power, so that now he is become the Head-Monarch of all this World; which Power, though you may envy, yet you can no wayes hinder Him; for all those that endeavor to resist His Power, shall only get Loss for their Labor, and no Victory for their Profit. Wherefore my advice to you all is, To pay him Tribute justly and truly, that you may live Peaceably and Happily, and be rewarded with the Blessings of Heaven: which I wish you from my Soul.  

After the Empress had thus finished her Speech to the Princes of the several Nations of that World, she desired that in their Ships might fall back; which being done, her own Fleet came into the Circle, without any visible assistance of Sails or Tide; and her self being entered into her own Ship, the whole Fleet sunk immediately into the bottom of the Seas, and left all the Spectators in a deep amazement; neither would she suffer any of her Ships to come above the Waters, until she arrived into the Blazing-World.  

In time of the Voyage, both the Empress's and the Duchess's Soul, were very gay and merry; and sometimes they would converse very seriously with each other. Amongst the rest of their discourses, the Duchess said, she wondered much at one thing, which was, That since her Majesty had found out a passage out of the Blazing-World, into the World she came from, she did not enrich that part of the World where she was born, at least her own Family, though she had enough to enrich the whole World. The Empress's Soul answered, That she loved her Native Countrey, and her own Family, as well as any Creature could do; and that this was the reason why she would not enrich them: for, said she, not only particular Families or Nations, but all the World, their Natures are such, that much Gold, and great store of Riches, makes them mad; insomuch as they endeavor to destroy each other for Gold or Riches sake. The reason thereof is, said the Duchess, that they have too little Gold and Riches, which makes them so eager to have it. No, replied the Empress's Soul, their particular Covetousness, is beyond all the wealth of the richest World, and the more Riches they have, the more Covetous they are; for their Covetousness is Infinite. But, said she, I would there could a Passage be found out of the Blazing-World, into the World whence you came, and I would willingly give you as much Riches as you desired. The Duchess's Soul gave her Majesty humble thanks for her great Favor; and told her, that she was not covetous, nor desired any more wealth than what her Lord and Husband had before the Civil-Wars. Neither, said she, should I desire it for my own, but my Lord's Posterities sake. Well, said the Empress, I'le command my Fish-men to use all their Skill and Industry to find out a Passage into that World which your Lord and Husband is in. I do verily believe, answered the Duchess, that there will be no Passage found into that World; but if there were any, I should not Petition your Majesty for Gold and Jewels, but only for the Elixir that grows in the midst of the Golden Sands, for to preserve Life and Health; but without a Passage, it is impossible to carry away any of it: for, whatsoever is Material, cannot travel like Immaterial Beings, such as Souls and Spirits are. Neither do Souls require any such thing that might revive them, or prolong their Lives, by reason they are unalterable: for, were Souls like Bodies, then my Soul might have had the benefit of that Natural Elixir that grows in your Blazing-World. I wish earnestly, said the Empress, that a Passage might be found, and then both your Lord and your self, should neither want Wealth, nor Long-life: nay, I love you so well, that I would make you as Great and Powerful a Monarchess, as I am of the Blazing-World. The Duchess's Soul humbly thank'd her Majesty, and told her, That she acknowledged and esteemed her Love beyond all things that are in Nature.  

After this Discourse, they had many other Conferences, which for brevity's sake I'le forbear to rehearse. At last, after several Questions which the Empress's Soul asked the Duchess, she desired to know the reason why she did take such delight, when she was joyned to her Body, in being singular both in Accouterments, Behavior, and Discourse? The Duchess's Soul answered, she confessed that it was extravagant, and beyond what was usual and ordinary: but yet her ambition being such, that she would not be like others in any thing, if it were possible, I endeavor, said she, to be as singular as I can: for, it argues but a mean Nature, to imitate others: and though I do not love to be imitated, if I can possibly avoid it; yet, rather than imitate others, I should choose to be imitated by others: for my Nature is such, that I had rather appear worse in Singularity, than better in the Mode. If you were not a great Lady, replied the Empress, you would never pass in the World for a wise Lady: for, the World would say, your Singularities are Vanities. The Duchess's Soul answered, she did not at all regard the Censure of this, or any other Age, concerning Vanities: but, said she, neither this present, nor any of the future Ages, can or will truly say, that I am not Virtuous and Chast: for I am confident, all that were, or are acquainted with me, and all the Servants which ever I had, will or can upon their oaths declare my actions no otherwise than Virtuous: and certainly, there's none even of the meanest Degree, which have not their Spies and Witnesses, much more those of the Nobler sort, which seldom or never are without Attendants; so that their Faults (if they have any) will easily be known, and as easily be divulged. Wherefore, happy are those Natures that are Honest, Virtuous, and Noble; not only happy to themselves, but happy to their Families. But, said the Empress, if you glory so much in your Honesty and Virtue, how comes it that you plead for Dishonest and Wicked persons, in your Writings? The Duchess answered, It was only to shew her Wit, not her Nature.  

At last the Empress arrived into the Blazing-world, and coming to her Imperial Palace, you may sooner imagine than expect that I should express the joy which the Emperor had at her safe return; for he loved her beyond his Soul; and there was no love lost, for the Empress equal'd his Affection with no less love to him. After the time of rejoicing with each other, the Duchess's Soul begged leave to return to her Noble Lord: But the Emperor desired, that before she departed, she would see how he had employed his time in the Empress's absence; for he had built Stables and Riding-Houses, and desired to have Horses of Manage, such as, according to the Empress's Relation, the Duke of Newcastle had: The Emperor inquired of the Duchess, the Form and Structure of her Lord and Husband's Stables and Riding-House. The Duchess answer'd his Majesty, That they were but plain and ordinary; but, said she, had my Lord Wealth, I am sure he would not spare it, in rendring his Buildings as Noble as could be made. Hereupon the Emperor shewed the Duchess the Stables he had built, which were most stately and magnificent; among the rest, there was one double Stable that held a Hundred Horses on a side, the main Building was of Gold, lined with several sorts of precious Materials; the Roof was Arched with Agats, the sides of the Walls were lined with Cornelian, the Floor was paved with Amber, the Mangerswere Mother of Pearl; the Pillars, as also the middle Isle or Walk of the Stables, were of Crystal; the Front and Gate was of Turquois, most neatly cut and carved. The Riding-House was lined with Saphirs, Topases, and the like; the Floor was all of Golden-Sand so finely sifted, that it was extreamly soft, and not in the least hurtful to the Horses feet, and the Door and Frontispiece was of Emeralds curiously carved.  

After the view of these Glorious and Magnificent Buildings, which the Duchess's Soul was much delighted with-all, she resolved to take her leave; but the Emperor desired her to stay yet some short time more, for they both loved her company so well, that they were unwilling to have her depart so soon: several Conferences and Discourses pass'd between them; amongst the rest, the Emperor desired her advice how to set up a Theatre for Plays. The Duchess confessed her Ignorance in this Art, telling his Majesty that she knew nothing of erecting Theatres or Scenes, but what she had by an Immaterial Observation, when she was with the Empress's Soul in the chief City of E. Entering into one of their Theatres, whereof the Empress could give as much account to his Majesty, as her self. But both the Emperor and the Empress told the Duchess, That she could give directions how to make Plays. The Duchess answered, That she had as little skill to form a Play after the Mode, as she had to paint or make a Scene for shew. But you have made Plays, replied the Empress: Yes, answered the Duchess, I intended them for Plays; but the Wits of these present times condemned them as uncapable of being represented or acted, because they were not made up according to the Rules of Art; though I dare say, That the Descriptions are as good as any they have writ. The Emperor asked, Whether the Property of Plays were not to describe the several Humors, Actions and Fortunes of Mankind? 'Tis so, answered the Duchess. Why then, replied the Emperor, the natural Humors, Actions and Fortunes of Mankind, are not done by the Rules of Art: But, said the Duchess, it is the Art and Method of our Wits to despise all Descriptions of Wit, Humor, Actions and Fortunes that are without such Artificial Rules. The Emperor asked, Are those good Plays that are made so Methodically and Artificially? The Duchess answer'd, They were Good according to the Judgment of the Age, or Mode of the Nation, but not according to her Judgment: for truly, said she, in my Opinion, their Plays will prove a Nursery of whining Lovers, and not an Academy or School for Wise, Witty, Noble and well-behaved men. But I, replied the Emperor, desire such a Theatre as may make wise Men; and will have such Descriptions as are Natural, not Artificial. If your Majesty be of that Opinion, said the Duchess's Soul, then my Playes may be acted in your Blazing- World, when they cannot be acted in the Blinking-World of Wit; and the next time I come to visit your Majesty, I shall endeavor to order your Majesty's Theatre, to present such Playes as my Wit is capable to make. Then the Empress told the Duchess, That she loved a foolish Farse added to a wise Play. The Duchess answered, That no World in Nature had fitter Creatures for it than the Blazing-World: for, said she, the Lowse men, the Bird-men, the Spider- and Fox-men, the Ape-men and Satyrs appear in a Farse extraordinary pleasant.  

Hereupon both the Emperor and Empress intreated the Duchess's Soul to stay so long with them, till she had ordered her Theatre, and made Playes and Farses fit for them; for they only wanted that sort of Recreation: but the Duchess's Soul begged their Majesties to give her leave to go into her Native World; for she long'd to be with her dear Lord and Husband, promising, that after a short time she would return again. Which being granted, though with much difficulty, she took her leave with all Civility and Respect, and so departed from their Majesties.  

After the Duchess's return into her own body, she entertained her Lord (when he was pleased to hear such kind of Discourses) with Foreign Relations; but he was never displeased to hear of the Empress's kind Commendations, and of the Characters she was pleased to give of him to the Emperor. Amongst other Relations, she told him all what had past between the Empress, and the several Monarchs of that World whither she went with the Empress; and how she had subdued them to pay Tribute and Homage to the Monarch of that Nation or Kingdom to which she owed both her Birth and Education. she also related to her Lord what Magnificent Stables and Riding-Houses the Emperor had built, and what fine Horses were in the Blazing-world, of several shapes and sizes, and how exact their shapes were in each sort, and of many various Colors, and fine Marks, as if they had been painted by Art, with such Coats or Skins, that they had a far greater gloss and smoothness than Satin; and were there but a passage out of the Blazing world into this, said she, you should not only have some of those Horses, but such Materials as the Emperor has, to build your Stables and Riding-Houses wit hall; and so much Gold, that I should never repine at your Noble and Generous Gifts. The Duke smilingly answered her, That he was sorry there was no Passage between those two Worlds; but, said he, I have always found an Obstruction to my Good Fortunes.  

One time the Duchess chanced to discourse with some of her acquaintance, of the Empress of the Blazing-world, who asked her what Pastimes and Recreations her Majesty did most delight in? The Duchess answered, That she spent most of her time in the study of Natural Causes and Effects, which was her chief delight and pastime; and that she loved to discourse sometimes with the most Learned persons of that World: And to please the Emperor and his Nobles, who were all of the Royal Race, she went often abroad to take the air, but seldom in the day-time, always at night, if it might be called Night; for, said she, the Nights there, are as light as Days, by reason of the numerous Blazing-Starrs, which are very splendorous, only their Light is whiter than the Sun's Light; and as the Sun's Light is hot, so their Light is cool; not so cool as our twinkling Starr-light, nor is their Sun-light so hot as ours, but more rate: And that part of the Blazing-world where the Empress resides, is always clear, and never subject to any Storms, Tempests, Fogs or Mists, but has only refreshing-Dews that nourish the Earth: The air of it is sweet and temperate, and, as I said before, as much light in the Sun's absence, as in its presence, which makes that time we call Night, more pleasant there than the Day: And sometimes the Empress goes abroad by Water in Barges, sometimes by Land in Chariots, and sometimes on Horse-back; her Royal Chariots are very Glorious, the Body is one entire green Diamond; the four small Pillars that bear up the Top-cover, are four white Diamonds, cut in the form thereof; the top or roof of the Chariot, is one entire blew Diamond, and at the four corners are great springs of Rubies; the Seat is made of Cloth of Gold, stuffed with Amber Greece beaten small: the Chariot is drawn by Twelve Unicorns, whose Trappings are all Chains of Pearl; and as for her Barges, they are only of Gold. Her Guard of State (for she needs none for security, there being no Rebels or Enemies) consists of Giants, but they seldom wait on their Majesties abroad, because their extraordinary height and bigness does hinder their prospect. Her Entertainment when she is upon the Water, is the Music of the Fish- and Bird-men; and by Land are Horse and Foot-matches; for the Empress takes much delight in making Race-matches with the Emperor, and the Nobility; some Races are between the Fox- and Ape-men, which sometimes the Satyrs strive to outrun; and some are between the Spider-men and Licemen. Also there are several Flight-matches, between the several sorts of Bird-men, and the several sorts of Fly-men; and swimming-matches, between the several sorts of Fish-men. The Emperor, Empress, and their Nobles, take also great delight to have Collations; for in the Blazing-world, there are most delicious Fruits of all sorts, and some such as in this World were never seen nor tasted; for there are most tempting sorts of Fruit: After their Collations are ended, they Dance; and if they be upon the Water, they dance upon the Water, there lying so many Fish-men so close and thick together, as they can dance very evenly and easily upon their backs, and need not fear drowning. Their Music, both Vocal and Instrumental, is according to their several places: Upon the Water, it is of Water-Instruments, as shells filled with Water, and so moved by Art, which is a very sweet and delightful harmony; and those Dances which they dance upon the Water, are, for the most part, such as we in this World call swimming- Dances, where they do not lift up their feet high: In Lawns, or upon Plains, they have Wind-Instruments, but much better than those in our World: And when they dance in the Woods, they have Horn-Instruments, which although they are of a sort of Wind-Instruments, yet they are of another Fashion than the former: In their Houses they have such Instruments as are somewhat like our Viols, Violins, Theorboes, Lutes, Citherins, Gittars, Harpsichords, and the like; but yet so far beyond them, that the difference cannot well be exprest; and as their places of Dancing, and their Music is different, so is their manner or way of Dancing. In these and the like Recreations, the Emperor, Empress, and the Nobility pass their time.  

The Epilogue to the Reader  

By this Poetical Description, you may perceive, that my ambition is not onely to be Empress, but Authoress of a whole World; and that the Worlds I have made, both the Blazing- and the other Philosophical World, mentioned in the first part of this Description, are framed and composed of the most pure, that is, the Rational parts of Matter, which are the parts of my Mind; which Creation was more easily and suddenly effected, than the Conquests of the two famous Monarchs of the World. Alexander and Cesar. Neither have I made such disturbances, and caused so many dissolution of particulars, otherwise named deaths, as they did; for I have destroyed but some few men in a little Boat, which dyed through the extremity of cold, and that by the hand of Justice, which was necessitated to punish their crime of stealing away a young and beauteous Lady. And in the formation of those Worlds, I take more delight and glory, then ever Alexander or Cesar did in conquering this terrestrial world; and though I have made my Blazing-world a Peaceable World, allowing it but one Religion, one Language, and one Government; yet could I make another World, as full of Factions, Divisions and Wars, as this is of Peace and Tranquility; and the Rational figures of my Mind might express as much courage to fight, as Hector and Achilles had; and be as wise as Nestor, as; Eloquent as Ulysses, and be as beautiful as Hellen. But I esteeming Peace before War, Wit before Policy, Honesty before Beauty; instead of the figures of Alexander, Cesar, Hector, Achilles, Nestor, Ulysses, Hellen, &c. chose rather the figure of Honest Margaret Newcastle, which now I would not change for all this Terrestrial World; and if any should like the World I have made, and be willing to be my Subjects, they may imagine themselves such, and they are such, I mean in their Minds, Fancies or Imaginations; but if they cannot endure to be Subjects, they may create Worlds of their own, and Govern themselves as they please. But yet let them have a care, not to prove unjust Usurpers, and to rob me of mine: for, concerning the Philosophical-world, I am Empress of it my self; and as for the Blazing-world, it having an Empress already, who rules it with great Wisdom and Conduct, which Empress is my dear Platonic Friend; I shall never prove so unjust, treacherous and unworthy to her, as to disturb her Government, much less to depose her from her Imperial Throne, for the sake of any other, but rather chuse to create another World for another Friend.

Black M,Chop Em Up,"3 ContributorsCortez vs. Rum Nitty (Rematch) Lyrics[Round 1: Cortez]
I'm only here to do Rum dirty, tuck birdy, drum sturdy
Lunch break: one, 30 (1:30)
If I lose tonight then I'm tyin' the judges, it's a hung jury
I'm violatin', nah, I won't leave no space
You fool them with this Pacino face, but in ya heart we see Nino traits
I don't believe that he sold weight
Why? Cause you got Cort' (court) after Drugz?
That means you about to fold, this a RICO case
Me no play today, see he no safe
See I O.D. 'til I see you D.O.A
So start respectin' me
Boy, that first battle? You was talkin' recklessly
You won't be caught (beat Cort') twice
Tonight? It's double Jeopardy
The .45? Baow! Trajectory
It specialize at making Crips walk with an accessory
So fuck that 100K, respectfully, this 'bout legacy
Y'all asked for the T, so I'm steam, lettin' the lemon squeeze
Boy, the only blue faces I respect, are dead to me
Machete, slash his memory
Good for one hack, like Patrick Beverly
Boy, I had to play it calm
Bullets go behind ya back like we breakin' bonds
I turn up and blast it in his head like his favorite song
I've been catchin' bodies,  y'all should catch the priors
After that Eazy battle they said, ""'Tez retire.""
I had an off season
And came back like J. Cole with goals to leave the 'net on fire
That's how you torch foes
There'll be yellow tape at your crossroads
White chalk, dark souls
Black TEC's, dark mode
Boy, I will smoke ya ashes to charcoal, that's how you earned (urned) death
Burst TEC's, burnt flesh
Trigger finger quicker than an A.I. first step
You might also like{Chokes}

What the fuck?
I'm chokin', it's a crazy session
Nah I'm bullshittin', that's just my Casey impression
I told niggas-

{Cortez ends the round on himself}


[Round 1: Rum Nitty]
I can't miss
I'm like Above The Rim when it comes to a name flip
And that's just something I live and die by Cort' (court) like my name's Flip
Dangerous, we don't play
I keep a razor that'll eat ya face
From ear to ear his cheek's fileted
I left Cort' (court) with a smile, cause my brother just beat the Case'
Every other Saturday, you've been cookin' fam'
But I knew as soon as I got to (w)rap in ya face, that'll be the weekend (Weeknd) that start lookin' bad
Pull a mag', shoot you wit' it
Barrel in his mouth, give him a moon roof ceiling
And blew his teeth clean out, like a Nunu visit
You think I'm trollin'? Bang it on him
Nina lickin', leave him crippled the way I'm finna make this Rican sitter think it over
I think it's over
That 100K, will go from motivation to a motive
30 popped him, no medics, just the Caffeine workers workin' on him
Applyin' pressure, inserting cotton
Bringing out the first aids on Cort' (court) like Irving Johnson
You heard me patna?
I'm real focused, fillin' bullets to the top, tryin' to see what the mil' holdin'
I just smoked Drugz, steel (still) loaded
I ain't tryin' to kill no one
I'm a family man, I don't think I'm 'Pac
But I'll squeeze a Glock to make it back to my kids, I'm the only thing they got
Then he heard a single pop
This ain't the best look
That dyke hoe that said you was better, will get her head whooped
I should've knocked yo' gay ass out Fit' (outfit) before I got to Cort' (court) like Westbrook
TEC cook
Get shot for real, got him killed
Now he can't even see his seeds grow Smack, fuck how papi feel (poppi field)
Dig a hole, you're gone now
Pole across yo' scalp
See it splat when the Rican crack like a dope house
You 'bout to get all type of bad
You won't see no kinda bag
What's another words for ""tournament""?
A ""tourny"" (attorney) and Cort' (court) don't stand a fightin' chance
I'm finna smoke dawg, I told y'all
You know what'll really make this body over the top?
If I up the pole Vault (pole-vault)
No talk
.50 Cal', bullets whizzin' out goin' ""Zoom, Zoom, Zoom""
That's all Cort' (court) hearin' now
You for real a clown
Aye you like puttin' yo' hands on women? I should clap you up
And let that bitch kick back, like J. Lo 'til  you had enough
{Smack calls time}

[Round 2: Cortez]
Aye fuck that first battle and fuck that first round
Now I'm talkin' spicy, I'm more seasoned in the kitchen
Sofrito drippin'
Wait, I heard that y'all be Crippin'
When since Cort' on blue (cordon bleu) this time, I'm cookin' different for the chicken
Glock clickin', pot whippin', .30 will bang
Look stupid, bird in the brain
Rum spilled on the carpet, that's a permanent stain
Ayo, matter of fact, hold on, they sayin' that the cops here?
We don't give a fuck about that shit
Boy if you there, we gon' pop there

{stumbles}

Boy if you there, we gon' pop there
I chop 'em up, sell him limbs on black market, that's a profit share
Fuck the Mexican talk too, caught somethin' bigger than taco here
And when the stock drop you'll do more than drop tier
What's poppin'? Yeah!
I told these nigga, ""I don't wanna battle.""
I sold guns from Cali to Queens nigga, these hollows gonna travel
Baow, and now you gargle on a capsule
You went from the top of the app Nitty, to the bottom of my barrel
I blast a Hawk
Rewatchin' Nitty ass get chalked
They'll be no future in you, those are my after thoughts
You don't ring bells, you never made it past the porch
In my hood? Ain't no gold medals but every other day I had to past the torch
So I keep a lil' piece
Will squeeze if I have to hear a Lil' Peep
Drill piece, steal his car; Lil' Reese
It's lit bro, that 100 round drum, let a clip go
I'll put the whole stock in his Crip tho (crypto)
It's currency Nitty, and I heard about the cash you makin'
In his crib, no mask, I'm vaccinated
Pistol whip, head crack, crack ya brain in
You'll run down Cort' (court)? Leave his basket hangin'
[?] Team Homi, oh that's your defense slime?
Swave sent the drop, I know where to catch slime
Stretch .9
You don't get it, Magneto helmet, I'm made to protect mines (minds)
Look Rum, random bars won't work, respect mines
When you talkin' to the plug, we need direct lines
I'm blazin' the lead
That fuckin' 100K's the only thing that plays in my head
It's bodega, it's only right this cat gettin' laid over bread
I was fed, y'all disrespected, now I'm catchin' a fury
Cause like a bag full of percies, I started handin' out 30's
UM3, round 3, oh now y'all follow my journey?
Once Smack signed off Cort' (court), showed the power of a tourney (attorney)
I'm bangin' early, yeah it's a tragic thing if I clap the thing, the 'matic ring
First a Blood, now a Crip, they crown this Latin, King
I'll white flag ya team, Nitty soul get levitated
Once the casket close Nit' (knit) family; separated!
I'm in ya hood, and I got metal to grip
It's a clean 30, that's a gentleman's clip
And it back Cort' (court) in Phoenix like Devin and Chris
{Smack calls time}

[Round 2: Rum Nitty]
Aye real talk though my nigga
Who be helpin' you write?
Cause when you said that one line...I'm lyin', you ain't said nothin' that's nice
This shit is over
I'ma lift it on him, no mask
Show up bare (bear) faced on Cort' (court) like the Grizzly's logo
I'm on a mission solo, waitin' outside ya crib for you
Cort'll get clipped, soon as he come out that bitch; umbilical
Pop the trunk, you gonna get in too, there's plenty room
Even that hoe (whole) Fit can go wit' Cortez, it's a Dickie suit
You that nigga too
But that Shotgun ain't got no respect for a legend
{gun clicks}
And this is Proof
Nigga move
I need that 100, and ain't no Mission Impossible
So my logic is, if you gotta eat then (Ethan) Hunt somethin'
Who the fuck want it?
I'll pull it out and stretch him, squeeze and buck
Now the Rican's struck (reconstruct), now they tryin' to put you back together
Replace part of your skull or you dead
So you can imagine yo'self winnin' that money, but that place (plates) all in ya head
Fam' done
I'll hit him in the Cadillac truck, he can't run
Drag him, big ass Escalade on Cort' (court) like And 1
And what?!
You can try and punch wit' me, that's your choice
But the skill gap is about here in (hearing) range, we on two different frequencies
And I know that hurts (hertz) more
War lord
Literally, this shit is over Cort' (court), check the scoreboard
After dawg get stretched, I'll take all the money and jewelry off his neck
I left Cort' (court) in the street without a dime...like Delonte West
On the set
Aye, you better help ya homie this time
Cause we came in this bitch with like eight .45's (8:45)
But I'm finna show Cort the (quarter) .9 (9:00)
You get outta line? Then this boy done
Just give me his second half, I'm finna zip Cort' up
And I get done shankin' Mr. Spanish, I'ma tell him ""send your (senor) cut""
Aye, I give a fuck if they show love to me when I do rappin'
My nigga, we had to pull the plug on our own mama cause she was unresponsive
I kept talkin', and that's the only time I needed a reaction
That shit left me broken too
Literally, broke in two
She left $100,000 in life insurance but that couldn't close my wounds
I ain't even want it!
She died for us to get that money
Now so will you!
Load the tool, trip and you gon' die
You from Brooklyn? You really from the Stuy' (stye)?
But the pain is different in my eyes
On God

[Round 3: Cortez]
Ayo a .9 pop, brains everywhere when I pop
I even got blood on the Rollie, you just died on my watch
We slide ops, blast you
In Brooklyn, we don't drive quarts, we drive past you
I'm cravin' the case and we known for sliders like White Castle
I told niggas, yo Smack, you don't about none of these niggas
Cause you put 100K on the head of every one of these niggas
I'll do the job, work for hire
Easy fee, by myself, I scam alone, no PPP
So go ahead and talk stupid, my dawg shooters, raw/ruthless
Beanie Siegel, State Property, final scene; Cort' (court) shootin'
I chalk students, I hate y'all, in my face God
It's fake y'all, Jake Paul
After this there won't be no more cap after this after we faceoff
I hate y'all
I'm made inside, I'm the Undertaker out the casket, I'm back alive
Pistol whip, Louieville Slugger, crack ya mind
And they will never look at you again once I bat an eye
Told you nigga, that's facts
Nitty all you do is clap MACs
I'm different, off that Bacardi Rum we back caps
Yeah boy, ya roof get splattered, then the tool I splatter
12 leave 'em dead, who the fuck said, ""these Blue Lives Matter""?
I sold a shit load of hammers, I put it all in the bricks
The work literally cost me a grip
I'm talkin' on yo' strip in yo' hood, I was trappin'/schemin'
You had traps in AZ Nitty? I haven't seen it
You was in the game 6?
Well, before Jordan I was winnin' with packs in (Paxson) Phoenix
And I peep it, the sneak shit
Uh huh, I'm onto they ass
You and Geechi? Y'all splittin'? Y'all goin' half?
EMS pick 'em up when I split 'em, both in halves
Word

[Round 3: Rum Nitty]
Aye! There's no half assin' or back trackin'
Just clap at him
Revolver hold six, but only three of the rounds blew (blue) like an App battle
I'm that badder
Nigga you can't see? This the nigga you can't beat
This is like the third time fire on Cort' (court) I'm on a 2K streak
Elite
I'm finna go on a run, I told you he done
You'll get left
I'll displace you Cortez, it can only be one
If I go to the trunk, this bitch gon' learn, it's my word
Grip it firm, hit up Ern' (Ernest)
Bury the murder weapon
Planting (plant in) the spring feel (Springfield) like Mr. Burns
Kill confirmed
I'll pull up on this man's set like, ""Who want funk?""
Dum dum in his shotgun like a crash test
Leave fam' stretched
We be wildin' and you not a problem like an abscess
I'm past that, I don't gotta kill niggas
For a couple racks they gon' deal wit' 'em
I just pay 'em like a G M.O. (GMO), and that ain't even no real chicken
Still spinnin', I let it air
Fuck a drive-by, I'll hop out the Cherokee on foot like the Trail Of Tears
Let's be clear
Before this was goin' down
You knew you would lose before this was goin' down
What's goin' down?
You don't wanna live or you just gave it up?
And became a donor now
Load the cal' if dawg want it
I'ma rob niggas like, ""Give it all nigga.""
Or I pull a MAC's and force Cortez, I put the fear of God in him
My nigga!
This shit is a wrap
All them plates you been gettin' from Smack
And as we can see, Cor' done ate (coordinate) a lot, but this still ain't a match
Facts!
Me run out of punches, that's somethin' you won't ever see
After all this time, I still be surprised at my gift, cause I never peaked (peeked)
Let me eat
.40 shoot near
Unload the blue steel
I give a fuck what you got under that tee ese (TSA), it's goin' through clear
For real!
Aye, I gotta keep workin' I can't lose
Just like your government, I'm still out here earnin' (Ern' in) my name too
Thang shoot, murk 'em bad
Body in the furnace since you've been tryin' to reach Surf so bad
Now we can finally see Ern' (urn) and ash
You trash
Just a nigga that I gotta drop
Before they stop the clock, I gotta make sure every punch count; it's Com-U-Box
And that's a lot
You know I'll do you bad
You can't catch a break?
You either gon' have to change what you wrote or throw away the pad
We can crash
This ain't it Cortez
You fat, sloppy, body bitch
The fans say they miss fit (Ms. Fit) Cortez

I can't even trust my friends, most of them might be foes
Watch these hoes when they say they want a lot of me

Break me, solely
For the one I share
Preaching slowly
But hands curled up tightly
My tears won't flow against her will
Oh won't you tell me please, how you can hear me?

[Verse 1: Wiki]
Told me gotta rap on it
Rat-a-scat on it
Skiddily doo-wop, do a dab on it
Low key wanna nap on it, but now I'm back on it
Talking like a weatherman, calls it like we sees it
Be a better man, all about the season
Think I'm working for the pork, ain't had a choice but had a reason though
Seventeen, community service was my recess
Cause it's some BS (what?), Pops was hot
Called them senior kids, called them CS
As I regress, had to shed some fools and some defects, sharpen my reflex
Don't give a fuck about respect, I don't give a fuck I'm a reject, course I gotta eject
Did what the fuck you expected, my shit too electric, way I flow electrical
I picked up right where they left it, regrettable
So I left it and made next shit, acceptable?
Still not? What you hatin' on? They hangin' on my testicles
Gotta shake 'em off, fuckin' skepticals

Okay, okay, okay everybody, settle down, settle down
I go by the ultimate, Denzel Curry and this is a poem called 'what's the point?'

[Verse 2: Denzel Curry]
What's the point of living in the now if you can't see that your future is bright enough to blind the sun?
What's the point of being a star when people see you from afar yet you're constantly getting blocked by everyone?
What's the point? It's worse than the way I feel when you just wanna hit
There's not a difference between musicians and women
Now I'm sending my apologies to the hearts I apprehended and the ones that ain't acknowledge me
Oh well, farewell, so gone, bittersweet
Only thing I want in life is love and my inner peace
Big house, nice lawn, and a hatchback
Twin flame living in my lap, who can match that?

My final destination are behind me like a spinal
Tapped into my psyche
Manifesting someone like me
Walking to the grocery store end up bumpin' into my wifey
Right up out my fantasies
Stay up here one advantage
I organize my thoughts and it seems I'm losing my sanity
Rambling 'bout when I'm my best whenever I'm gamblin'
Manifestin' most of my money in palms, handlin'
Channeling my inner self with my inner self
So it's two times deeper, beyond things that I've felt
If I felt, I feel
If I dealt, I deal
Given my ideals
Now I got what's real
Tangible, not mechanical
Caging my inner animal
Minutes eating up most of my time
The clock is a cannibal
Yet, there's other answers
Manifest the message
When there's nothing to count on
I'm counting all of my blessings

You ain't never heard no tales from the darkside
You ain't never heard no tales from the darkside
Welcome to the land
You ain't never heard no tales from the darkside
What it's 'bout?!

[Verse 1: Denzel Curry]
It’s ‘bout a young, running away from the moon to catch the sun quicker
Drug dealer, Nino with the steelo trying to sell kilos and grams
Settling angry stomachs up in his fam
So if that silver spoon on your plate, if you touch that, that's your fate
Don't have faith, Like Evans, you got to face demons to get to your heaven
The pimps is the prophеts, not prophets for reverеnds, this is the lifestyle of a broke adolescent
So here's a lesson of a teen that survived Rikers
But shortly, his life had ended with a bullet that's made out of Midas
Touch

[Chorus: J.K. The Reaper]
You ain't never heard no tales from the darkside
You ain't never felt the pain of the darkside
You ain't felt the burning flames of the darkside
You don't have a name on the darkside
You ain't never heard no tales from the darkside
You ain't never felt the pain of the darkside
You ain't felt the burning flames of the darkside
You don't have a name on the darkside

Knew a young brother without a name, he was in love with his nina trapped
And steadily schemin', barely sleepin', but dreamin' of pretty and beamers
But when he awake, he sees his fate
And his reality, to do whatever it takes to elevate his salary
Any a casualty, kill 'em, rob 'em
Then casually walk off into the darkness, it all started
When he was, welcomed into our up world, the son of a up girl
And his father was just a blur, his life had took a curve
When he saw his brother dead on the curb, due to retaliation
Of the gang relation, he was young, a kid, a baby
And yet to realize the pollution of the nation
Now he 18 life in jail is what he facin'
Murder was the case that they gave him
Murder was the case when they raised him
Mind stuck in the all black prison
You think he give a about the system?

Not giving a loc-ing off of the 'dro

So I went crazy, my vision got hazy
I walked in the bank, and I start to get bold
Clutching that pistol grip
The teller was moving too slow so I pistol-whipped
The he was twitching, bust at a civilian
And blasted the mag with no mask in the buildin’

Burn the fingertips off, replace the dental
Left the golden bullet magic in his coufie, no his temple
That’s engraved, leaving corpses
In graves, Glock 17 cutting fades

Then we switched the identity, chose the name Leroy Carter
The bank teller looking short and squeamish
Steve pistol-whipped the; she kept screaming
Shut up, before a nut up, ho

So he took her to the back, then Steve grabbed the MAC
Then he put it to her head, and then he ripped the

Yeah
The once lost, disciples - now found
Bound, together, forever

[Verse 1]
As I embellish, mentally I nourish
Resuscitate a mindstate that has perished, you shall inherit
His blood I require back, to Earth
We rise out of spiritual darkness, six thousand year curse
The lost disciples bound to the midst of the bottomless pit
Trapped behind the gates of the wicked wilderness
I hear the sounds of the trumpets blowing across the heavens
It's calm, prepare for the storm of the seven
Shabazz The Disciple, the holy exalter
Condemning those who sacrificing babies on the altar
I hear the cries of innocent black babies who are aborted
And unmercifully slaughtered
Loud screams echo, skulls of angry slaves
Turning over in their graves
The white sheets are like white flags, you need to wave it
To the soldier of the Lord; the warrior King David
I come to kill and crucify, those who trick and lie
In the eyes of the most high
The pale-face, devil race, caucasoid germ
Grafted from original black man's sperm
Thin-blooded weak, grafted-brain punk
Your power's a third of mine, you drunk funky skunk
How dare you use Jesus name to shell your filthy religion
My tongue be the sword to slash you with precision
The justice system is his, the court'll only acquit him
And eighty-five percent of y'all are going to hell with em
The walls of hell are closing in, disciples we rose again

Hanging from a fucking tree whipped-in, mentally abused

Cast upon your soul by inhabitants of Mount Caucus
Who praise the dead, and not the true and living
Killed Jesus and said that he died for their religion

Demons in my mind, ain't nowhere to hide, nigga
I got demons in my mind, ain't nowhere to hide
I got demons in my mind, ain't nowhere to hide, nigga
I be schemin' all the time when I'm on them lines, nigga
I ain't scared, what the fuck is you trippin' fo'? Nigga

[Verse 1: Denzel Curry]
Raider to gang, Waka to Flocka, Aquarius, nigga, go hard in the paint
Takin' this bank, Pee Wee, give me your flesh, I go hard with the shank
Visit a shark, sleep with the fish, Curry The Killer, that nigga who's this
Tommy Wright, ""Street Type,"" ""Hustle and Flow"" when I'm whoopin' that trick
Pull out the stick, pull out the gauge, Aquarius Killer, the Raider with rage
Up in the yard, don't step to this, demon around like ""The Exorcist""
Emily Rose, I'm tippin' these bowls and splittin' these hoes, we runnin' this shit
Raider to Klan, we crazy like Stan Miyagi, so sorry I'm cuttin' your bitch
Samurai, do or die, Raider to Klan, we all on the run
Little Jitt's wreckin' shit, bullets, Ballistics takin' his gun
Put it to a cop's head, watch a nigga drop dead
Ridin' in the Chevy, Lord Infamous bumpin' heavy
As I get the B, the L, the U-N-T
That's me, a real O.G., and Blackland is where I be

Pussy-ass nigga, you owe me money
Head full of shit cause your sister want to fuck me
Been at your house and you keep gettin' lucky
This shit won't last, no time for the fuck shit
I bet you on blast and I bet you get fucked quick
Call your little sis' cause I want to get my butt licked
4 A.M., geeked up on the suss
Lockpick dick your front door like I'm fuckin'
All in your crib, takin' all the shit
Glock 17 with a beam on a bitch
Aim at your dome when you sleep in the sheets
Shadow hand swag how I creep and I creep
With the all-black Vans you can't even see
Flesh feelin' numb from the cannabis seed
Nigga, I'm high, nigga, I'm dope
Ruben Slikk'll put the nine to your throat
Nigga, what you got? For a nigga life
Ruben fuckin' Slikk, yeah, sellin' that white
Backhand slap, slingin' that coke
I don't give a fuck, nigga never broke
Nigga fuckin' hoes, that's how I do
That's how I gotta live my life, see it through
To the fuckin' light, look to the light
Ruben fuckin' Slikk, get high off the white
Nigga take a bump right to the nose
I don't give a fuck, stay fuckin' with the hoes
Stay higher than a bitch, Ruben fuckin' Slikk
Higher than a motherfucker, extras in the clip
Got thirty rounds all up in a bitch
Finna just pull that trigger back, bitch
Nigga just put them holes in your chest

Black M,Denzel Curry - Diet_ | A COLORS SHOW,"5 ContributorsDenzel Curry - Diet_ | A COLORS SHOW Lyrics[Intro]
Woah, Kenny

[Verse 1]
Pamela Anderson, Pam Grier
The man's here, there's no fear
Came through with no tears (Wah)
I don't cry
Matter fact, I don't lie like a bedside
To tell the truth, then I tell you what it is or what it ain't
Please roll me up another dank, another smoke
Though I see it as the antidote to cure my daily anecdotes
I see my thoughts, it's adios
Finito, I get new jerseys like I was a guido
The ego, gotta be vetoed if you want a free throw
D'Evils, stay with the scripture, what your mama read you
You gotta milk the game, son, I couldn't bottle-feed you
This next bar was 'bout to do some Logic shit
But now it's time to stop the shit and let me pop my shit
Drama still added on, stayin' positive
All my niggas on my side, on the opposite

[Chorus]
Get money from a show, then deposit it (Uh)
Your show ain't got no hoes, I acknowledge it (Yeah)
So braggadocios, spit sick shit, it's atrocious (Nasty)
Risin' like the stocks, stockbroking
The Shogun, came through with no gun
One man, Ichiban, fresh out of Japan, do as I command
And what I demand is some fuckin' peace and quiet
Told 'em please go to church, and please get on a diet
You might also like[Verse 2]
Shoebox came with the doowop
One billion and two cops can't find 2Pac
Two shots, that's two grazed in two days
What goes up must come down on Tuesday
And I don't like Pixar, mister
I am the master, I came through like a (Wait a minute), bastard
Nobody fathered my style
People said I would fall off, but I've been here for a while, so nope
Are you ready for the motherfuckin' giant?
The tyrant, the titan, the ogre, the lycan
The vampire, taking over empires
If the game was a tooth, I'm a fuckin' pair of pliers
We gon' do 'em Vinny style
As you can see, this nigga got many styles (Serious)
Know too many niggas that got semi rounds (Serious)
They're cold like ice
Put thorns to your crowns, you go out like Christ, my niggas

[Chorus]
Get money from a show, then deposit it (Uh)
Your show ain't got no hoes, I acknowledge it (Yeah)
So braggadocios, spit sick shit, it's atrocious (Nasty)
Risin' like the stocks, stockbroking
The Shogun, came through with no gun
One man, Ichiban, fresh out of Japan, do as I command
And what I demand is some fuckin' peace and quiet
Told 'em please go to church, and please get on a diet
[Outro]
You motherfuckers know what time it is
It's the motherfuckin' championship1Embed"

Lick the bowl, bring the pot to the neighbor

Oh my gosh, I'm the seed of the Based God
Fuck love and peace, I spit hate crimes
No deal for me, fuck a co-sign
'Cause if I want mine, nigga, I'ma take mine

Black M,Did I Hurt U,"11 ContributorsEps1.0_hellofriend.mov (Script) LyricsBLACK.

ELLIOT (Voiceover): Hello friend. Hello friend? That’s lame. Maybe I should give you a name? But that’s a slippery slope. You’re only in my head. We have to remember that. Shit. It’s actually happened. I’m talking to an imaginary person.

Within the black of frame, silhouettes begin forming.

ELLIOT (V.O.): What I'm about to tell you is top-secret.

We pull out to reveal we’re in an office looking out of a very tall Manhattan skyscraper. Shadowy figures sit and stand around a conference table, arguing.
ELLIOT (V.O.): A conspiracy bigger than all of us. There's a powerful group of people out there who are secretly running the world.

ELLIOT (V.O.): I'm talking about the guys that no one knows about. The guys that are invisible. The top 1% of the top 1%. The guys that play God without permission.
CUT TO BLACK.

ELLIOT (V.O.): And now I think they’re following me.

INT. NYC SUBWAY (MOVING) - MORNING
We finally meet ELLIOT (late 20s). His hoodie throws a sliced shadow over his face.
He sneaks looks at a couple of mysterious MEN DRESSED IN BLACK, one on either side of the train. One reads the NY Post. The other looks straight ahead, suspiciously so.

ELLIOT (V.O.): This is about last night. I should have gone to Angela’s birthday party. Instead I went to--
INT. RON’S COFFEE (FLASHBACK) - NIGHT
A large coffee shop with a fair amount of patrons. A cheesy sign that reads “Ron's Coffee” displays on the door. Elliot sits by himself, hoodie on, no coffee. His leg taps nervously.

Elliot intently watches as a mild-mannered Indian with a mustache walks into the shop. This is RON (40s-50s).

He orders a latte from the front and sits alone. He pulls out his iPad and sips his latte, enjoying the quiet evening to himself.

Elliot musters courage with a deep breath and walks over. He sits across from him without saying a word, his leg twitching.

RON stares at him.

ELLIOT: You're Ron.

He nervously gestures to the cheesy sign. Confused, Ron glares at him in response.

ELLIOT (nervous and robotic): But your real name is Rohit Mehta. You changed it to Ron when you bought your first Ron’s Coffee shop six years ago. Now you got 17 of 'em with 8 more coming next quarter.

An awkward silence. Ron tilts his head, not sure if he should be flattered or concerned.

RON (thick Indian accent): May I help you with something?

ELLIOT: I like coming here 'cause your Wi-Fi was fast. I mean, you're one of the few spots that has a fiber connection with gigabit speed. It's good. So good, it scratched that part of my mind, part that doesn't allow good to exist without condition, so I started intercepting all the traffic on your network. That's when I noticed something strange. It's when I decided to hack you.

Another awkward silence. Ron leans forward.
RON: Hack--

ELLIOT: I know you run a website - called Plato's Boys.
Alarms suddenly go off in Ron’s world.

RON: Pardon me?

ELLIOT: You're using Tor networking to keep the servers anonymous. You made it really hard for anyone to see it, but I saw it.

Even though Elliot came off a little amateurish at first, his confidence builds as he continues to talk.

ELLIOT: The onion routing protocol, it's not as anonymous as you think it is. Whoever's in control of the exit nodes is also in control of the traffic, which makes me...the one in control.

RON: I must ask you to kindly leave--

Elliot pulls out a thick folder of files and places it on the table.

ELLIOT: I own everything. All your emails. All your files. All your pics.

Ron flips through a few pages then slaps the folder close.

RON (angry): Get out of here right now, or I'll call the--

ELLIOT: Police? You want them to find out about the 100 terabytes of child pornography you serve to your 400,000 users?
Ron is stunned silent. Ron looks down, cornered and speechless. Elliot looks genuinely sympathetic.

ELLIOT: Personally, man, I was hoping it was just gonna be some BDSM stuff. You realize how much simpler that would have been?

RON: I did not hurt anyone. I never did. That's my personal life.

All the blood in Phil’s face as drained. Emotion begins to fill his face. Elliot looks at him, a mix of pity and guilt.

ELLIOT: I understand what it's like to be different. I'm very different too. I mean, I don't jerk off to little kids, but I don't know how to talk to people. My dad was the only one I could talk to. But he died.

At first, Ron is unsure on how to proceed. But sensing an opportunity, he takes a deep breath and nods sympathetically.

RON: I'm sorry to hear that. How did he pass, may I ask?

ELLIOT: Leukemia. He definitely got it from radiation at the company he worked at, though I couldn't prove it. Now he's dead. Company's fine, though.

Ron can’t help but start crying. Elliot genuinely feels for him.

ELLIOT: Oh hey. It's okay, Rohit. You don't have to worry anymore.

Ron looks up, confused.

RON (confused then angry): I don't understand. Are you blackmailing me? So that's what this is about money. That's all you care about, huh? No. If I pay you now, you'll want more and more. No matter how much I give. You will inform the police anyway. I won't pay you, sir. Remember, you also broke the law.

Elliot nods agreeingly. He looks out the windows, as if looking for something.

ELLIOT: Actually, you're right. Partly. See, I usually do this kind of thing from my computer, but this time I wanted to do it AFK. In person. Trying to work on my social anxiety. But there's always the threat of you fleeing after I call you out.

Elliot leans over and begins to zip up his bag, getting ready to stand.

ELLIOT: You'd tell your sys admin to take your servers down, wipe all the data.

Elliot stands, putting his oversized bookbag on.

ELLIOT: So I made sure to include the current time and and location on my anonymous tip.

Ron stands up with Elliot.

RON (desperate, nervous): Wait. Hold on. I'll give you the money. I'll pay you. How much do you want? I'll pay you.

Sirens can be heard. Lights swirl outside the windows.

ELLIOT: That's the part you were wrong about, Rohit. I don't give a shit about money.
POLICE race into the shop as Elliot breezes past them, heading out, leaving the chaos to surround the destroyed Phil.
Violent jazz slowly BUILDS on the soundtrack.
TITLE SEQUENCE
INT. NYC SUBWAY (MOVING) - MORNING
Back to present day, Elliot snaps awake. He eyes the two MEN IN BLACK who still sneak looks at him.

ELLIOT (V.O.): Now I'm being followed. The higher ups don't like someone with my powers. In three short minutes, I destroyed a man's business, life, existence. I deleted him.

On the far end of the packed train, a dark-haired man YAWNS loudly. He looks like a disheveled Californian who’s been forced to relocate. He wears cargo pants and what looks like a gas attendant shirt that reads: Computer Repair With A Smile. Below it, a logo reads MR. ROBOT (40s). He looks at Elliot with a stoner’s smile as he brushes his scraggly beard. Elliot doesn’t smile back. Across the crowd of people, the man shouts:
MR. ROBOT: Hey! Hey, you. Hey, kiddo. What's happening?

Elliot doesn’t answer. Instead, he looks away, pretending he didn’t hear him.

MR. ROBOT: Exciting time in the world right now. Exciting time.
Mr. Robot lies on his back, returning to his homeless slumber.
EXT. NYC STREETS - LATER
Elliot walks through the crowded streets of New York, carefully avoiding the touch of other humans. He carries a huge bookbag on his back.
INT. ALLSAFE OFFICES - LATER
He walks into the modest offices of AllSafe Cybersecurity, as announced by the boring, corporate logo.

ELLIOT (V.O.): But I'm only a vigilante hacker by night. By day, just a regular cyber security engineer, employee number ER28-0652.

INT. ALLSAFE OFFICES - GIDEON’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
The AllSafe boss, GIDEON GODDARD (40s), a bearded metrosexual with adult braces stands while ANGELA (20s), a blonde girl-nextdoor trapped in the prim and proper veneer of a private school upbringing, looks at him sternly. Gideon shouts through his glass doors:

GIDEON: Elliot, in here!

[indistinct chatter]

Angela: ...All over the price. Yeah, I can totally, I can totally handle it.

GIDEON: Look--

Elliot nervously walks in, curiously looking at Angela who pretends he’s not even there. Gideon passes a file to him.

GIDEON: They were hacked again. Last night.

ANGELA: Gideon--

ELLIOT (V.O.): That's my childhood friend Angela. She can be a bit high strung sometimes, but trust me she's one of the good ones.

Elliot looks over the notes.
ELLIOT: What am I looking at? Is this the log file? This was a RUDY attack.
Concerned, Gideon nods. Elliot shakes his head, impressed more than he usually is.

ELLIOT: This is awesome.

ANGELA: Gideon, will you please answer me?

GIDEON (to ELLIOT): Awesome? You think this is awesome? This is killing us, Elliot.

ANGELA: Gideon, I'm not leaving--

GIDEON: Angela! Let's just see how this meeting goes today. Their networks are getting attacked every week. Who knows if they'll still even be a client.

ELLIOT: They’re coming in?

Gideon’s look confirms it. He looks at Elliot’s hoodie.

GIDEON: Hey, what did we say about the dress code?

Elliot sheds his hoodie, revealing an oversized, button-downed dress shirt underneath. He hates it.

GIDEON: All right, now, look over those logs. And be ready this afternoon in case they have any questions. Okay?

ANGELA: Okay

INT. ALLSAFE OFFICES - HALLWAYS
Elliot and Angela walk out. Elliot smells something on her.

ELLIOT: Start smoking again?

ANGELA (ignores his question): Did you not get my texts last night? I sent you exactly 13 of them.

ELLIOT: Yeah, I'm sorry. I couldn't make it.

ANGELA (looks at him): You promised me that you were gonna try this time.

FLASHBACK
Last night, Elliot nervously walks up to the entrance of a packed bar. Through the big windows outside he sees Angela, laughing, smiling, drinking with friends. Elliot’s hand goes for the door, but his hand trembles--

ANGELA: Stop thinking about something else when I'm talking to you. I hate when you do that.

ELLIOT: Sorry, I was thinking about work.

ANGELA: Maybe that's why Gideon loves you so much. He thanks me all the time for bringing you in. But for some reason, I think you secretly hate it here.

ELLIOT (V.O.): She was right. I liked most of the people, but our business--a cyber security firm that protects corporations--I can't think of anything I hate more.

ELLIOT: No, I love it here.

Elliot and Angela both chuckle.

ANGELA: I'm sorry. I'm just in a bad mood. I'm late on my last two student loan payments, and I can't get Gideon to give me a raise.

A slick, good-looking white man named OLLIE (20s) walks up and kisses Angela.

OLLIE (to Angela): Hey.

ANGELA (to Ollie): Hi.

OLLIE (to Elliot): Yo, buddy. Missed you last night. Where were you?

ELLIOT: Gotta go, big meeting today.

Elliot doesn’t wait for a response, he disappears into the maze of cubicles quickly.

OLLIE (to Angela): Did you find out what happened?

ANGELA: Yeah. He said he was working.

OLLIE (not buying it): Oh, come on. You gotta talk to him.

ANGELA (rolls her eyes): We’re gonna be late for the staff meeting.

OLLIE: He can't stand me. And you know why. Angela, I can't have that kind of negativity in my life--

Angela glares at him. Ollie points.

OLLIE: That's exactly what I'm talking about.

EXT. NEW YORK STREETS - DAY
Elliot shiftlessly walks through the streets once again, big bookbag in tow. His eyes wander around in paranoia. He continues to eat his McDonald’s fries from the bag.
INT. PSYCHOLOGIST’S OFFICE - DAY

He sits across from his psychologist, KRISTA (30s-40s), a slender African-American woman who tries too hard at youth with a short dress.

They’re looking at each other in silence.

KRISTA: What are you thinking about?

ELLIOT: Nothing.

KRISTA: Wanna know what I’m thinking about? The first time you came to me.

ELLIOT (V.O.): I didn't exactly come to Krista. I was forced here. But I do like her. Hacking her was simple. Her password: Dylan 2791. Favorite artist and the year in which she was born, backwards. Though she's a psychologist, she's really bad at reading people. But I'm good at reading people. My secret: I look for the worst in them.

INSERT: Krista’s Gmail and Facebook. We land on her eHarmony profile.

ELLIOT (V.O): I know she went through a divorce four years ago. I know she was devastated by it and has been dating losers on eHarmony ever since.

INSERT: A profile pic of a salt and pepper handsome gent. He’s a nice fellow with a middle-aged face and a welcoming smile. His name is listed as Michael Hansen.

ELLIOT (V.O.): Her most recent foray Michael Hansen. I searched for him online, but nothing came up. No LinkedIn, no Facebook, nothing. Something about him bugs me, scratching that part of my mind again. But I'll hack him soon enough. I always do.

Back to the scene. Elliot eyes Krista.

KRISTA: I know you're not yelling like before, which is good. But I can tell you're still holding on to it. And we need to work on your anger issues, Elliot. You're angry at everyone, at society--

ELLIOT (V.O.): Fuck society.

KRISTA: I know you have a lot to be angry about, but keeping it to yourself and staying quiet like you're doing it's not going to help you. There's pain underneath. That's where our work needs to go.

Elliot says nothing. Krista leans forward.

KRISTA: What is it about society that disappoints you so much?

Elliot holds back as his eyes wander to the Apple insignia glowing off of Krista’s laptop on her desk.

ELLIOT (V.O.): Oh, I don't know. Is it that we collectively thought Steve Jobs was a great man, even when we knew he made billions off the backs of children?
His eyes shift to the glass framed Tour De France poster hanging on the wall featuring Lance Armstrong.

ELLIOT (V.O.): Or maybe it’s that it feels like all our heroes are counterfeit, the world itself just one big hoax.
His eyes refocus on the reflection of the glass frame, seeing that Krista’s browser from her laptop is on Twitter.

ELLIOT (V.O.): Spamming each other with our running commentary of bullshit masquerading as insight, our social media faking as intimacy.

Krista still eyes Elliot, waiting for him to respond. He returns his stare back at her, noticing the “I voted” sticker on her blouse.

ELLIOT (V.O.): Or is it that we voted for this? Not with our rigged elections--

His eyes now notice the expensive accessories of Krista. Her earrings, watch, shoes, her Hunger Games book in her bag.

ELLIOT (V.O.): But with our things, our property, our money. I'm not saying anything new. We all know why we do this, not because Hunger Games books makes us happy--

Krista crosses her legs, still waiting on Elliot to respond. That’s when Elliot spots a prescription bottle next to Krista’s purse on her desk chair.

ELLIOT (V.O.): But because we wanna be sedated. Because it’s painful not to pretend, because we’re cowards. Fuck society.

KRISTA (echoing): Elliot. You’re not saying anything, what’s wrong?
He finally responds to Krista.

ELLIOT: Nothing.

Krista collects herself, frustrated she’s getting nowhere.

ELLIOT: Don’t be frustrated.

KRISTA (confused): Why shouldn’t I be?

ELLIOT: You’re different than most. You at least try. You at least understand.

KRISTA (intrigued): Understand what?

ELLIOT: What it's like to feel alone. You understand the pain. You want to protect people from it. You want to protect me from it. I respect that about you.

Long silence.
KRISTA: Why do you think I know what it's like to feel alone?

ELLIOT (V.O.): Shit! From her emails!

KRISTA: Elliot?

ELLIOT: I don’t know.

Krista lets it go.

KRISTA: Let's talk about last night. Did you go to Angela's birthday party?

FLASHBACK: Last night, we pick up where we left off. Elliot’s hand trembles as he reaches for the door to the bar. He sweats as he closes his eyes and tries to force himself to go in, but can’t. The door opens, three people file out. Elliot quickly moves out of the way, avoiding physical contact at all costs. He takes a breath and looks through the windows again. Angela is happy, surrounded by friends, enjoying her birthday. Ollie walks up to her. They kiss. This is enough for Elliot to wrap his head in his hoodie and walk away--

Back to the scene.

ELLIOT: Yeah. It was nice.

KRISTA: Did you try to talk to anyone?

ELLIOT: Sure. I got a girl’s number.

KRISTA (impressed): You did?

ELLIOT (chuckles): She’s cute. She likes the Hunger Games.

KRISTA (back to being suspicious): You're hiding again, Elliot. When you hide, your delusions come back. It's a slippery slope. Let's talk about the men in black you've been seeing. Are they still there?

ELLIOT: No, I told you they're gone. The meds you gave me are working.

INT. ALLSAFE OFFICES - CUBICLE - LATER
Elliot types away at his computer. He glances up and notices Ollie approaching.

OLLIE: Yo man. Do you wanna--

Elliot reluctantly takes off his headphones.

OLLIE: Uh, do you wanna do lunch today?

ELLIOT: Uh yeah, I got other plans--

OLLIE: Other plans. Right. That’s what you said the last three times I asked you.

Ollie looks around.

OLLIE: Look, bud, you and Angela have been close for a long time, and that's even more reason why I want us to be on good terms. I - I just I feel like things have been awkward between us. Don't you?

ELLIOT: I’m okay with it being awkward between us.

OLLIE (awkwardly laughs): Um, yeah. I - I - I’m not okay with that.

OLLIE (more sympathetic tone): Um look, man, I love Angela, and I want us to to get along for her sake. I mean, that's what I'm that's what I'm here for. I just, I - I don't normally do stuff

As Ollie drones on again, Elliot’s stream of consciousness interrupts:

ELLIOT (V.O.): Am I that crazy not to like this guy? Among some of his Facebook likes are--

INSERT: Ollie’s Facebook profile and likes.

ELLIOT (V.O.): George W. Bush’s Decision Points, Transformers 2: Revenge of the Fallen, and the music of Josh Groban. Must I really justify myself any further?
Back to scene.

ELLIOT (V.O.): His was the easiest to hack. Password was 123456Seven.

INSERT: Ollie’s Gmail account.

ELLIOT (V.O.): I witnessed his first ""I love you"" with Angela over Gchat.

INSERT: Profile pic of a trashy woman named Stella B.

ELLIOT (V.O.): Then I witnessed the first of many infidelities with Stella B.

Back to the scene. Ollie’s still in the midst of his phony plea.

OLLIE: ...I've never done anything like this before.

ELLIOT (V.O.): I've thought about telling Angela, but she has shitty taste in men, and I'm not quite ready to see what comes after this just yet.

OLLIE: ...You like music. I like music. Maroon 5.

ELLIOT (V.O.): Plus I can manage Ollie easier than the others. For now, anyway.

OLLIE: And that's all I mean. I just want you to know that. I like you, bro, and I want you to like me too.

ELLIOT: I understand. I’ll try harder.

OLLIE: That's cool, man. Hey, whenever you're ready, I'd love to just...chill--

He puts his arm on Elliot’s shoulder-- but Elliot, not comfortable with the physical contact, shifts his shoulder away.

OLLIE: Oh, forgot about your no touching thing.

ELLIOT (V.O.): Truth is, I shouldn't hate Ollie; he's not that bad a guy. He's too dumb to be bad. In fact, when I think about the really bad people--

As if sensing it, Elliot peeks out of his cubicle. He sees a handful of business SUITS at the front. The SUITS head towards Gideon’s office.

ELLIOT (V.O.): E Corp, the largest conglomerate in the world. They're so big, they're literally everywhere.

E Corp’s logo, which looks like the Enron “E” logo, is shown on all the products inside of the office: desktops, smartphones, laptops.

ELLIOT (V.O.): A perfect monster of modern society. The E might as well stand for Evil.

An advertisement plays on a television and displays some of E Corp’s ventures. Agriculture, electronics, medicine, construction.
ELLIOT (V.O.): In fact, after a thorough, intensive self-reprogramming, that's all my mind hears, sees, or reads when they pop up in my world.

INSERT: E Corp advertisement.

WOMAN: That's what we have to offer. Together, we can change the world with E Corp--

INSERT: Replace E Corp logo with Evil Corp logo

ELLIOT (V.O.):  Krista would have a shit fit if she knew I did that. But that’s what they are...a conglomerate of evil. And now I have to help them.

Gideon and the team of SUITS walk up next to Elliot’s cubicle.

GIDEON: There are six on-site engineers on your account. Plus a few off-site.

Elliot sneaks a peek at the head suit, Steve Ballmer with a full mane of hair.

ELLIOT (V.O.): There he is, Terry Colby, the CTO.

TERRY COLBY looks around with a doofus smile.

ELLIOT (V.O.): Even though he's the head technology guy at one of the biggest companies in the world, he owns a Blackberry.
Elliot’s eyes shift to Terry’s Blackberry on his belt. Terry looks at Elliot’s desktop with confusion.

ELLIOT (V.O.): But also looks like he doesn't see a terminal very often. He's not a techie. He's a moron.

The suits, led by Gideon, keep on walking through the office.

ELLIOT (V.O.): An arrogant moron. The worst kind.

Elliot focuses on his terminal, but a person from the pack walks up to him. He’s good-looking, sharply dressed and has a rock star smile. His name is TYRELL WELLICK (30s). He reaches his hand out to Elliot. Elliot painfully takes it.

TYRELL (thick Swedish accent): Oh, hi. Tyrell Wellick. I'm Senior Vice President, Technology.

ELLIOT: I’m...Elliot. Just a tech.

TYRELL: Don't be so humble. You know, I started out exactly where you are, and to be honest, you know, my heart is still there. [looking at his screen] So I see you're running Gnome. You know, I'm actually on KDE myself. I know this desktop environment is supposed to be better but you know what they say. Old habits they die hard.

ELLIOT (V.O.): An executive running Linux with--

TYRELL: Yeah, I know what you're thinking. I'm an executive. I mean why am I even running Linux? Again old habits. It's gonna be fun working with you. I should join the rest of the group. Bonsoir, Elliot.
He takes off with an earnest smile.
Elliot sits back down in his cubicle with a resigned sigh. He takes in his small three-walled cube universe amidst the thirty other identical cubes.

ELLIOT (V.O.): Sometimes I dream of saving the world.

His eyes look over at Lloyd who is busy paying a Verizon bill online.

ELLIOT(V.O.): Saving everyone from the invisible hand, one that brands us with an employee badge.

Elliot eyes his fellow employees sympathetically, all looking like enslaved serfs with their company badges hanging off them.
EXT. NYC STREETS - NIGHT
Elliot walks through the streets alone as GROUPS OF FRIENDS laugh while walking in and out of bars. Credit cards are swiped, dollar-tips are thrown, a homeless man begs for change.

ELLIOT (V.O.): The one that forces us to work for them. The one that controls us every day without us knowing it. But I can’t stop it. I’m not that special.

INT. ELLIOT’S LOFT - NIGHT

Elliot enters his messy small loft.

ELLIOT (V.O.): I'm just anonymous. I'm just alone.

Elliot makes his way over to a fishbowl, swimming inside is a black fish named QWERTY.

ELLIOT (V.O.): If it weren't for Qwerty, I'd be completely empty.

MOMENTS LATER

ELLIOT (V.O.): I hate when I can't hold in my loneliness. This crying has been happening too often, every other week now. What do normal people do when they get this sad? They reach out to friends or family, I think.

INT. ELLIOT’S HOUSE (FLASHBACK) - DAY
A YOUNG ELLIOT (8) sits at the kitchen table. His MOTHER (30s), pretty but cold. Buttoned up, a short haircut, and expressionless face. She methodically smokes a cigarette. Young Elliot looks like he’s been scolded. His mother grabs his arms and slams them down on the table.

ELLIOT (V.O.) : That’s not an option.

INT. ELLIOT’S LOFT - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
Elliot crushes up morphine pills. He puts the crushed powder on a small glass table and cuts it with a credit card.

ELLIOT (V.O.): I do morphine.

INT. ELLIOT’S LOFT - MOMENTS LATER
Elliot snorts up a line of morphine. He lies back down on the floor as it takes effect. He sprawls out on his couch, staring at Qwerty as it takes effect.

ELLIOT (V.O.): The key to doing morphine without turning into a junkie is to limit yourself to 30 milligrams a day. Anything more just builds up your tolerance. I check every pill I get for purity. I have 8 milligram Suboxone for maintenance in case I go through withdrawals--

Elliot’s eyes shift from Qwerty to an empty prescription bottle.

ELLIOT (V.O.): Shit! I’m out again.

He reaches out for it in disbelief.
MOMENTS LATER
SHAYLA (20s), a hipster girl, steps into the room. She slides an orange bottle full of pills.

ELLIOT: How much?

SHAYLA: On the house.

ELLIOT: No Shayla, not doing that. Okay? This is just a regular drug deal, like it always is.

Elliot offers her cash. Shayla resigns herself and takes it.

SHAYLA: So what are you you to tonight? 'Cause I tried to post something on your Facebook and couldn't find you.

ELLIOT: I’m not on Facebook.

SHAYLA: What? Why not?

ELLIOT: ‘Cause I hate Facebook.

SHAYLA (offended): That’s crazy.

Elliot shoots her a look, “I guess I’m crazy.” Disappointed, Shayla playfully pulls out two white pills from her pocket.

SHAYLA: Well you want to do these together then? Pure Molly.

The last line piques Elliot’s interest, though his look is already regretting the decision.
INT. ELLIOT’S LOFT - LATER
Elliot lies naked in his bed, smoking a joint, while a nude Shayla lies next to him, fast asleep. He wears a dumb look.

ELLIOT (V.O.): Don't ever make decisions when you're on morphine.

His cell beeps. He looks at it.

ELLIOT (V.O.): Instagram check-in for Krista at Pierre Loti. Okay, Michael Hansen. Time to find out who you really are.

EXT. PIERRE LOTI - NIGHT
Elliot, in a hoodie, walks by Pierre Loti across the street. He doesn’t walk towards it, instead he stays put, lurking around the corner.

Elliot looks around the city block he’s standing on. In the distance, a late night diner shows two MEN IN BLACK having coffee. Elliot hides in the shadows, watching them.
EXT. PIERRE LOTI - AWHILE LATER
Elliot’s spies Michael from across the street as he watches him kiss Krista goodbye. They part ways.

Michael hails a cab. Elliot snaps a picture of the number on top of Michael’s cab as it takes off. He quickly pulls out his cell phone and dials.

ELLIOT (into the phone): Uh, hi I just left my keys in one of your cabs. 56Y2. Sure.

Suddenly, the MR. ROBOT bum from the subway walks up to their table, begging for money. Elliot shoots a confused look-- but gets interrupted when the operator returns.

ELLIOT: 306 Hawthorne. Thank you. Thank you.

He hangs up and returns his gaze back to the two MEN IN BLACK. Mr. Robot is nowhere to be seen. He lets it go for now and returns to the task at hand.
EXT. 306 HAWTHORNE AVENUE - LATER
Elliot walks up and sees the cab, waiting by the curb. On the stoop in front of 306 Hawthorne, Michael begrudgingly walks his dog. It’s as if Michael has completely dropped his cheery, nice guy act.

MICHAEL: Come on, asshole, piss already! Come on!

He jerks the dog by his leash, causing him to YELP.

Elliot charges from across the street.

The cowed dog looks up sheepishly at Michael as it nervously paces around the small patch of grass.

MICHAEL: Come on! Will you will you go? - Come on, go, go!

He yanks the dog into the air by the leash, when Elliot finally gets there--

ELLIOT: Hey!

MICHAEL: Go, will ya?

The dog yelps again.

ELLIOT: Hey!

Michael stops and turns. Elliot looks at the dog with sympathy, but then back at Michael.

ELLIOT: May I borrow your phone? Mine's dead. I need to call my mom.

Michael reluctantly nods and pulls out his cell. He slides it unlocked with his passcode and hands it to him.

ELLIOT: Thank you.

Elliot takes it, immediately memorizing all the apps on his homescreen, specifically the E Corp app.

He dials his own number and calls. From within Elliot’s back pocket, we see his phone light up and vibrate.

Elliot gets his own voicemail. He hangs up, quickly deletes his call log and looks back at Michael.

ELLIOT: No answer. Thanks anyway.

Michael takes his phone back with a shrug.
EXT. NYC SUBWAY - LATER
Elliot walks out of the subway station, smoking a joint. His phone immediately vibrates. He looks at it with a question, then answers.

ELLIOT: Angela, is everything okay?

INTERCUT WITH:
INT. ALLSAFE OFFICES - CUBICLE
Angela stands apart from Lloyd, who is desperately trying to tackle a tech issue on his desktop.

ANGELA (into the phone, discreet): I need you to come to AllSafe.

ELLIOT: You're there? It's three in the morning.

ANGELA: They attacked Evil Corp servers again, but it's bad this time. It's a DDoS attack.

ELLIOT: Did you call Lloyd? He's on call.

ANGELA: Yeah, he's here.

ELLIOT: Is he talking to their tech department?

ANGELA: He's online with them, but so far nothing. I don't think that Lloyd can handle this. Look, Gideon just put me on this account. I can't screw up in my first week. I need you. Please.

Elliot looks back into the subway. He tosses his joint.
INT. ALLSAFE OFFICES - NIGHT
Elliot races in. Angela walks up to him, panicking.

ANGELA: Finally!

ELLIOT: Calm down, it’s only been an hour.

ANGELA: Yeah, well, an hour in Evil Corp time is like $13 million in revenue, approximately. Actually, I calculated that. That's exactly how much they lost.

ELLIOT: Don’t worry, I got you.

They approach Lloyd who is sweating bullets in his cubicle.

ELLIOT: Lloyd, what’s up?

No response, Lloyd is locked in on his terminal.

LLOYD: Elliot. This is bad. Worst DDoS attack I've ever seen.

ELLIOT: Did you reconfigure the DNS?

LLOYD: Yes!

ELLIOT: Stop the services.

LLOYD: I already stopped the services, tries to reboot the servers but they're not coming back up. Dude, someone is straight up fingerblasting their entire network right now.

Elliot types furiously on his desktop, navigating Evil Corp’s
servers.
Angela checks her phone.

ANGELA: They just started reporting on the outage.

ELLIOT (V.O.): Shit. This is worse than I thought. They’re in the network.

Elliot types away as Gideon walks in. Even though he’s angry, he keeps his cool. He sees Elliot, then faces Angela.

GIDEON: What's the status update? See here. I thought we set up security protocols - so that this doesn't happen. Where’s the attack coming from?

ELLIOT: Everywhere, obviously. - The USA, Finland, Thailand, Kuwait--

GIDEON: Start restarting the services, load sharing, redirect the traffic--and call Prolexic for help.

ELLIOT: Wait.

GIDEON: What?

ELLIOT: I don't think this is just a DDoS attack. I think they got a rootkit sitting inside the servers.

ANGELA: What’s a rootkit?

LLOYD: It's like a crazy serial rapist with a very big dick.

ANGELA: Jesus, Lloyd!

LLOYD: Sorry. It's malicious code that completely takes over their system. It can delete system files and stop programs. Viruses, worms--

ANGELA: How do we stop it?

LLOYD: That's the thing. It's fundamentally invisible you can't stop it. All of their servers are timing out. None of them are coming back up.

Elliot moves to Lloyd’s terminal to check something.

ELLIOT: That's because every time we restart the server the virus replicates itself during boot up and crashes the host.

LLOYD: How are we supposed to bring up the network if we can't restart the servers?

ELLIOT: We can't. Which is what they wanted. By defending ourselves, we ended up spreading the virus everywhere.

Everyone exchanges tense looks. Gideon tries to contain himself as he already knows what follows.

ELLIOT: Only thing we can do is we've gotta take the whole system offline, wipe the infected servers clean, then bring them back up.

GIDEON: You’re coming with me.

ELLIOT (whispers): Yeah.

GIDEON: Lloyd. Tell everybody to start taking everything offline.

LLOYD: Got it.

GIDEON (on the phone): Uh, the server farm in Dulles. We're gonna need the jet.

EXT. PRIVATE JET - NIGHT

Gideon and Elliot speed walk towards a slick black sedan already waiting for them.
INT. SERVER FARM - NIGHT
Elliot speed-walks into the loud WHIRRING of the large arrays of servers.

GIDEON: They're booting the network back up. Now, you're downloading the logs, right because--

ELLIOT: Stop. Tell him to stop.

GIDEON: What?

ELLIOT: Don't start the boot sequence. You guys missed one. There's an infected server up and running.

Elliot moves to the server display and points out  cs 30.

ELLIOT: What's the ETA before it hits this server? (Elliot)The backup server up and running?

A spectating TECH nervously stares at the display and then Elliot before shrugging.
Elliot returns to the console and starts to furiously type.

ELLIOT: The backup server up and running?

TECH: It's ready, but it's not configured for auto switch.

Elliot races towards the backup server, cs51. He finds it terminals in.

ELLIOT: We need to redirect the traffic, need to switch DNS.

The displays shows that the network is slowly coming back online, approaching the still-infected server, cs30.

GIDEON: This is impossible.

ELLIOT: You got this, you got this, you got this.

As Elliot continues to type, nearly all the servers but cs30 and cs51 have come back online. He manages to switch the DNS to cs51 at the last second.

ELLIOT: We still up?

Gideon holds his breath and watches as the network boots up the backup server and then the remaining ones before letting it all out.

GIDEON: We’re okay.

ELLIOT: Yeah.

Gideon squats down to Elliot with a huge grin on his face. He proudly squeezes Elliot’s shoulder. Elliot shies away from the contact.

ELLIOT: I'm gonna take a look at the infected server, okay? Give me a minute.

GIDEON (put off): Yeah. Uh I'll meet you at the elevators.

The spectators disperse along with Gideon. Elliot continues to furiously type.

ELLIOT (V.O.): They must have left a mark or something. Every hacker loves attention. They don't just do DDoS attacks for no reason.

That’s when Elliot stumbles upon a data file in the terminal that reads simply: fsociety00.

ELLIOT (V.O.): This is it. Fsociety. Is that supposed to be a joke? This was way too easy. They didn't hide it well at all.

He /dir’s it and a flurry of files go flying by, the last one being README.TXT. He opens it. It reads simply: leavemehere.

ELLIOT (V.O.): This note is for me. They're telling me to leave it here. But why? Doesn't matter. Time to shut them down.

Elliot can’t bring himself to delete the rootkit.

ELLIOT (V.O.): Why can't I delete it? I don't want to delete it. I want it to stay. What's wrong with me?

Elliot nervously looks around before he cancels the delete command.

ELLIOT (V.O.): I'll reconfigure the access to the root directory so only I can use it. And no one will know.

INT. PRIVATE JET (MOVING) - DAWN
Exhausted, Elliot and Gideon sit silently together. Though Elliot is used to the all-nighters, Gideon isn’t. He has a glass of wine as he sits back, deep in thought.

GIDEON: Did you know that I'm gay?

ELLIOT: Um...no.

After an awkward pause, Gideon uncomfortably nods.

GIDEON: Consider this me coming out to you then, okay? It's hard because I don't like to talk about my sex life. But my partner, he gets very paranoid. He thinks I'm ashamed of-- he wants me to be more public about it. So. Anyway, I'm gay.

ELLIOT (awkward pause): Thanks.

Gideon: Yeah.

Deep in thought again, Gideon takes a deep breath. Elliot notices the troubled look on his face.

ELLIOT: Hey, man, don't worry about it. Hackers have a short attention span. They'll get bored, harass someone else--

GIDEON: Evil Corp is thinking about leaving us. And I don't know if I can blame them...

Gideon takes another sip of his wine and leans back in his chair. He shakes his head.

ELLIOT: They could have called their other security teams.

GIDEON: Mm.

ELLIOT: They called you.

GIDEON: Well, somebody over there likes us, but Terry Colby, he's getting the pressure. And he calls the shots. Evil Corp is 80% of our business. If we lose them, it's gonna be it for us. It's gonna be it--for me.

They both sit in silence for a moment. Gideon looks over.

GIDEON: I feel like I can talk to you. I mean, more than the others, anyway.

They share a comfortable moment this time.

GIDEON: I'm sure, in a weird way, you'll be happy if we went under. Oh, come on. Come on. I know you hate wearing those stupid shirts.

ELLIOT: Gideon? I promise I'll find them.

INT. NYC SUBWAY (MOVING) - DAY
Elliot’s drained face stares stoically out, trying to piece together the mystery of the recent hacks.

ELLIOT (V.O.): Evil Corp service should be back up soon enough. I'll take a look at the dat file. I'll ask my IRC contacts about fsociety when I get home. I've never seen their name on the boards though. They've gotta be new, but they're good--

Elliot’s train of thought is interrupted when Mr. Robot sits across from him, donning the same gas attendant shirt.

MR. ROBOT: Rough night?

Shocked, Elliot’s eyes grow large.

MR. ROBOT: I'm getting off here. I think you should come with me. But only if you didn't delete it. You deleted it, we got nothing to talk about.

Mr. Robot stands and waits by the doors. Elliot sits there, paralyzed, not knowing what to do at all.

ELLIOT: Are you talking to me?

Mr. Robot says nothing, but the empty car states the obvious. The subway finally screeches to a halt. Elliot reamins seated as it stops. Mr. Robot walks off the subway. Elliot sits there for a moment, wondering if he should follow him as the doors close. He does.
PLATFORM - CONTINUOUS
Mr. Robot sits on the other side of the station. Elliot slowly walks over and sits next to him.

ELLIOT: Who are you?

MR. ROBOT: We gotta wait for the Q.

ELLIOT: Then what?

MR. ROBOT: Then we're going to Brooklyn. Out by Coney Island.

ELLIOT: Why? What’s there.

Mr. Robot is silent for a moment, taking a deep breath as he looks at Elliot.

MR. ROBOT: Obviously you're gonna ask a lot of questions. It's weird what you're doing right now, I get it. I-I can't tell you anything until we get there.

Mr. Robot pulls out a cigarette and lights it.

ELLIOT: Can't smoke in here.

Mr. Robot ignores him.

ELLIOT: You've been following me. Why? What do you want from me?

MR. ROBOT: My dad was a petty thief. Never could hold down a job. So, he just robbed, convenience stores, shops, small-time stuff. One time, he sat me down, he told me something I never forgot. He said, ""Everyone steals. That's how it works. You think people out there are getting exactly what they deserve? No. They're getting paid over or under, but someone in the chain always gets bamboozled. I steal, son, but I don't get caught. That's my contract with society. Now if you can catch me stealing, I'll go to jail. But if you can't, then I've earned the money. "" I respected that, man. I thought that shit was cool as a little kid. A few years after that, they finally caught him. Sent him to jail. Dies five years later. My respect goes with him. I thought he was free doing what he did, but he wasn't. He was in prison. Just like you are now, Elliot. But I'm gonna break you out.

Elliot shoots him a quiet, puzzled look. Mr. Robot puts on a pair of sunglasses, smiles big and then stares ahead.
EXT. CONEY ISLAND - STREETS - DAY
An impoverished, ghetto block. Elliot cautiously follows Mr. Robot down the street. An old Ferris wheel can be seen slowly spinning in the distance.

They finally reach a rundown, closed up arcade. The sign reads: FUN SOCIETY ARCADE (but the U and N are missing/faded). Robot walks up to the back door, gesturing Elliot to follow him.
THE BACK - CONTINUOUS
Mr. Robot opens the backdoor. Blue, green, and gray Ethernet cables run from all sides of the door. The sound of KEYBOARD STROKES emanates from within. ROMERO (50s) - a long, gray-haired hippie with a fanny pack - opens the door. He looks over Elliot before going back inside. Mr. Robot walks in. Elliot follows.
INT. FSOCIETY ARCADE - CONTINUOUS
An arcade with very little working games left. Using fallen games as tables for computers, four hackers type away: MOBLEY (30s) - an obese man with shaggy hair. TRENTON (16) - a Muslim girl hunched over at a terminal. DARLENE (20s) - an aggressive yet striking hipster who chain smokes. She wears a fur coat and blue Ray Bans.

ELLIOT: Why would you guys actually meet IRL?

None of them look up, all of them with earbuds plugged in as they type away. Silence fills the room. Mr. Robot gestures for Elliot to follow him around the corner, into the center of the arcade.

MR. ROBOT: You remember that hacker group O-Megz? They got outed by their own leader to the FBI, and six hackers went to prison for it? You know how they got 'em?

Mr. Robot walks over to the popcorn machine and starts eating straight out of it.

MR. ROBOT: They went on the dude's computer, tracked 'em all down through emails, VPN sessions, chat messages, texts. One guy, and the whole thing comes down. It's what's called--

ELLIOT: A central point of failure.

MR. ROBOT: Right. Because they refused to meet in person, they compromised each other every time they sent so much as a smiley face. The rule here is, it's done here, and only here. It ends when you walk out that door, and begins when you walk in. Our encryption is the real world.

ELLIOT: How do you talk to each other then?

Mr. Robot walks over to the kitchen sink and pours himself water from the tap.

MR. ROBOT: We don't. We come and go, work on the project when we can.

ELLIOT (discreet): How do you trust them?

MR. ROBOT: How do you trust them? - I give them an exercise. If they pass, they join us. If they fail...

ELLIOT: The DDoS attack last night...you were testing me.

Mr. Robot takes off his jacket as he sits down and smiles yes. Elliot peers back to the hackers.

ELLIOT: You said there was a project.

MR. ROBOT (nods):That'll come later. I just wanted you to see the place.

Mr. Robot starts typing away. Elliot stands there, unsure of how to proceed.

MR. ROBOT: There's not much you can do without a CPU.

INT. NYC SUBWAY (MOVING) - MORNING
A visibly unnerved Elliot sits in silence.

ELLIOT (V.O.): I'm crazy. I have to be crazy because that didn't just happen, right? This is a delusion. Is this a delusion? Shit, I'm a schizo.

INT. NYC STREETS - DAY
Elliot doesn’t walk the streets so carefully this time, as his mind swims in the mystery of what he just witnessed.

ELLIOT: Have I really lost it this time? No, no. Last night happened. It was real. Angela called me. I was at AllSafe. Evil Corp's servers were compromised. Those are facts, not delusions. I know. I know, I know I realize I'm saying all of this to an imaginary person, but I created you. I didn't create this.

EXT. ELLIOT’S APARTMENT BUILDING - STEPS - DAY
Elliot walks to his building and sees Angela sitting outside on the steps, waiting for him. She stands when she sees him.

ANGELA: Oh, thank God you're here. I was just about to go wait in the Starbucks. You live in a bad neighborhood. Do you know that?

ELLIOT: I do know that.

She shows him a BACK TO THE FUTURE II DVD.

ANGELA: Do you want to get high and watch your favorite movie? Oh, you saved our asses last night. I thought Gideon was definitely gonna fire me. Where have you been? I thought you'd be sleeping.

ELLIOT: I--yeah, I fell asleep on the train.

ANGELA (skeptical): That sounds like such a lie, but, whatever. I don't want to get into that right now. So you want to do this? I miss Qwerty, I hope she still loves me.

INT. ELLIOT’S LOFT
Elliot unlocks the door and they walk into the apartment. They share an awkward moment as they see Shayla, naked, asleep on Elliot’s bed.

ELLIOT (V.O.): Shit.

ELLIOT: She wasn't supposed to be here, okay? - Give me a minute and I'll get rid of her.

ANGELA: That’s okay. Um...this is great. Elliot, I’m happy for you.

ELLIOT: No, it’s not like that.

ANGELA: Well, maybe it should be, you know? It's good that you're dating.

Elliot reluctantly nods in defeat.

ANGELA: Well, I'll see you on Monday. We can do movie night next time. I promise, okay?

ELLIOT: Yeah.

ANGELA: Have fun.

Elliot nods as she walks out the door. Frustrated, he opens the door and slams it shut to wake Shayla.
Shayla stirs awake as he walks towards the bed.

SHAYLA: Elliot? Oh, shit. Is it Wednesday?

ELLIOT: Shayla--

SHAYLA: I have to move my car.

ELLIOT: Shayla, leave. NOW.

INT. ELLIOT’S LOFT - DAY
INSERT: Google, 4chan, message boards, blogs, news sites, etc.

ELLIOT (V.O.): No mention of Mr. Robot anywhere. No mention of fsociety. Not on any of the hacker boards. Not on IRC, forums, blogs, no one's heard of them.

INSERT: Google maps on the fsociety arcade.

ELLIOT (V.O.): Property was owned by Fun Society Amusement, LLC for 13 years. Owner was shot a killed a year and a half ago. No owner since. And the ownership history before that is sparse to nonexistent. This guy is good. Very good. Doesn't matter. Their arcade network's IP is in the dat file. That'll be enough to turn them in.

Elliot prints out the incriminating pages and files them in a blue manila envelope. Elliot sits back down, looking at the Google Maps picture of the fsociety arcade. The temptation is too strong, he cracks.

ELLIOT (V.O.): What’s your ask, Mr. Robot?

EXT. CONEY ISLAND STREETS - LATER
Elliot, carrying his bulky bookbag, walks through the slums of Coney Island, back to the fsociety arcade.

Outside, Darlene stands outside the back door and smokes. She has the thick fur coat on to protect her from the cold air.

Elliot enters through the metal gate and walks up to her. She doesn’t say anything to him.

ELLIOT: Hey man, where’s your boss?

Darlene shoots him an odd look.

DARLENE: Okay, cut the bullshit. When are you going to give us access to the root directory?

ELLIOT: What?

DARLENE: Dude, come on. I wrote that rootkit. I still have to put Colby's IP in the .dat file.

Darlene shakes her head with disgust and flicks her cigarette.

DARLENE: Dickhead.

She walks towards the back door, leaving Elliot perplexed. Mr. Robot enters from the street, holding a grocery bag full of goodies.

MR. ROBOT: Elliot! Good news. I scored the last bag of Twinkies from Gristedes. You want one?

ELLIOT: She just called me a dickhead.

MR. ROBOT (smiles): Yeah, that's Darlene.

Mr. Robot gestures towards the Ferris wheel.

MR. ROBOT: Hey, you like Ferris wheels?

EXT. CONEY ISLAND - FERRIS WHEEL - DAY
Elliot and Mr. Robot stand in a slow-moving, empty Ferris wheel car as it does its circular motion up. Mr. Robot looks down at the abandoned area with a grin, eating a twinkie.

MR. ROBOT: Ah, it's beautiful. Gets better the higher up you go, you know? Oh, I love it up here. You like it?

ELLIOT: I'm here to tell you I'm turning you in. I'm giving them all the information--

MR. ROBOT: Let me tell you why you're really here.

Confused, Elliot says nothing.

MR. ROBOT: You're here because you sense something wrong with the world. Something you can't explain. But you know it controls you and everyone you care about.

ELLIOT: What are you talking about?

MR. ROBOT: Money. Money hasn't been real since we got off the gold standard. It's become virtual. Software. The operating system of our world. And, Elliot, we are on the verge of taking down this virtual reality. Think about it. What if you could take down one conglomerate? A conglomerate so deeply entrenched in the world's economy, that too big to fail doesn’t even come close to describing it.

ELLIOT: You want to create another financial meltdown like the one we just had, but way worse. Yeah, why would I want that? Everyone would lose their money.

MR. ROBOT: What if I told you that this conglomerate just so happens to own 70% of the global consumer credit industry? Huh? If we hit their data center just right, we could systematically format all the servers, including backup.

ELLIOT: That would erase all--

MR. ROBOT: All the debt we owe them. Every record of every credit card, loan, and mortgage would be wiped clean. It would be impossible to reinforce outdated paper records. It would all be gone. The single biggest incident of wealth redistribution in history.

Elliot realizes what he’s talking about. To underline this, he sees an Evil Corp logo proudly displayed on top of a building in the horizon.

ELLIOT: Evil Corp. The conglomerate. That's why you picked me. Because I work at AllSafe.

Mr. Robot reaches into a pocket and pulls out a slip of paper with an IP address.

MR. ROBOT: Tomorrow, AllSafe is going to get a visit from the FBI and the U. S. Cyber Command. You are going to modify the dat file and put Colby's terminal IP address in there.

ELLIOT: Terry Colby? You're gonna frame him? No one's gonna believe that. I met him, he's a moron.

MR. ROBOT: So are the FBI. Even if they don't believe he did it, they'll believe he gave someone access to it.

ELLIOT: Yeah, he'll just go to jail. What good will that do?

MR. ROBOT: You don't take down a conglomerate by shooting them in the heart. That's the thing about conglomerates, they don't have hearts. You take them down limb by limb. And as they unravel, their illusion of control unravels.

Elliot takes a hard look at Mr. Robot, questioning his seemingly altruistic motives.

ELLIOT: Who are you?

Mr. Robot takes out a cigarette.

MR. ROBOT: That'll come later. Right now, you have a lot to think about. You have to change the dat file and put Colby's IP in there. You do that, you have set in motion the largest revolution the world will ever see.

Elliot’s look of doubt is all but whittled away.
Neil Diamond’s “If You Go Away” plays
”If you go away on this summer day”
INT. NYC SUBWAY STATION (MOVING) - NIGHT
Elliot can’t contain the flurry of emotions as they flash across his face.
Sensing Elliot’s excitement, a CHILD smiles at him. Touched, Elliot smiles back.
Elliot notices an E Corp advertisement on the subway wall about student debt. He stops and stares.
INT. ELLIOT’S LOFT - NIGHT
”And the moon stood still for the nightbird song”
Elliot skips around multiple pages on his computer. He’s on Angela’s Facebook page before looking over her bank statements and private E Corp student loans.  She owes $197,455.64.
Elliot types away on his computer, we see text as he’s skipping around. NY TIMES - Debt Slavery, The New American Dream. BBC - The global gap between rich and poor is at its highest level for 20 years and growing. HuffPost - Mortgage lenders now have more equity in U.S. homes than Americans.
Elliot looks over at Mr. Robot’s slip of paper next to him. He opens a new command-line and begins typing up the report.
MOMENTS LATER
The final pages of the new diagnostic report prints out. He places the report and a CD in a blue manila envelope. He pauses as he places it next to the white envelope he prepared earlier.
INT. NYC STREETS - NEXT MORNING
”If you go away, as I know you must”
The MEN IN BLACK on the sidewalk sneak Elliot looks. Elliot’s excitement from the night before starts a slow descent.

As Elliot walks to the subway, he stares at a poster for a blockbuster movie called VILLAINS, the tagline reads: Evil Always Wins.
INT. ALLSAFE OFFICES - CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER
”Like the empty look I see on your face”
Gideon, Elliot, Lloyd, Angela, AllSafe account executives, FBI, and Evil Corp execs cramp the conference table. He nervously glances around the room, tensing up as Terry Colby and Tyrell Wellick walk in. Disappointedly, he pulls out the white envelope
The song stops playing after “Till your next hello/If you go away...”

TERRY COLBY: So, what do we got?

GIDEON: So, if you'll take a look at the first page of your agenda--

Everyone flips over one page of their packet. Terry looks over at Elliot. Elliot nervously looks back.

TERRY COLBY: You're the one who stopped the hack. You know, the gals in analysis said this was a tough one. All things being equal, it should have shut us down for days. So you did good.

ELLIOT (uncomfortable): Okay.

GIDEON: We should start with our account executive, Angela.

ANGELA: Okay, we first noticed the breach at 2:07 A.M. Eastern Standard on Friday night--

TERRY COLBY: You mean, Saturday?

ANGELA: Sorry, yes, technically, Saturday morning.

TERRY COLBY (condescending): Yeah, okay, Angela, that's what we're here for. The technicals.

Noting the condescension, Angela hides her anger.

ANGELA: Anyway, he arrived at the office at 2:35 and I instruct--

TERRY COLBY: Okay, wait, wait, wait. So that's almost a half hour after the initial breach. Why didn't anyone pipe in from their laptops?

ANGELA: It’s not protocol--

ELLIOT: It wouldn't have been secure if someone terminaled in on this. It was the smarter move to have someone come in - so they can log in on a secure line.

ANGELA (annoyed): Exactly. Then Lloyd was able to--

TERRY COLBY: Just--just actually, just one second.

Terry gestures to Tyrell. Tyrell leans in and Terry whispers something in his ear. Tyrell exchanges a glance with Gideon and they step outside the conference room. From the look on Gideon’s face, it’s not good. Angela looks like she’s gonna flip out.

TERRY COLBY: You know, I, uh, I always loved this view.

After the brief exchange, Gideon returns to Angela’s side, collects her papers, and walks her out of the conference room.

TERRY COLBY (to Elliot): Now that that's taken care of, let's pick it up where we left off.

ELLIOT: What happened to Angela? She knows more about what happened.

TERRY COLBY: She's not going to work out for us, not on this level. We need to stick to the more tech savvy here.

Elliot’s eyes shift back and forth between the embarrassed Angela who is walking down the hallway, the blue manila envelope still in his bag and Terry Colby’s curious look. Elliot instantly gains courage. He swaps the white manila for the blue.

Tyrell notes the envelope exchange.

TERRY COLBY: Now, let's get to the heart of this thing because I can't sit here and look through a packet for the next 20 minutes. All right, just who did this? Is it that hard? Who did this?

ELLIOT: I found the configuration file of the rootkit with a pattern of IP addresses. Once you decrypt it, you'll know where the hack came from.

CUT TO BLACK
FADE IN
INT. ELLIOT’S LOFT - MORNING
Elliot hasn’t slept and it shows. He checks his laptop and quickly searches around news blogs and hacker boards. His face falls. He checks his phone: 0 results.

ELLIOT (V.O.): 19 days. No news, no arrests, no revolution.

EXT. NYC STREETS - LATER
Elliots moves through the crowd, avoiding contact as usual.
INT. ALLSAFE OFFICES - DAY
Elliot looks over the cubicles at work, everything seems to be normal as ever.

ELLIOT (V.O.): No FBI, Colby, Evil Corp.

EXT. CONEY ISLAND - DAY
Elliot walks by the fsociety arcade, but it’s abandoned. No wires, no hackers, no Mr. Robot.

ELLIOT (V.O.): No Mr. Robot. No fsociety.

Elliot walks back to his apartment building.

ELLIOT (V.O.): I need to take my mind off things.

MOMENTS LATER
INT. ELLIOT’S LOFT - DAY
INSERT: Krista’s Facebook, Gmail, eHarmony profile, Michael’s eHarmony profile.

MICHAEL (Off Screen): Hello?

ELLIOT: Hi, this is Sam from Bank of E security fraud department. Unfortunately I have to inform you that your account's been compromised.

MICHAEL (O.S.): What? What happened?

ELLIOT: First before I can answer any questions, I need to verify some information. Are you still at 306 Hawthorne Avenue?

MICHAEL (O.S.): Yes. Apartment 2C.

ELLIOT: Great.

Elliot inputs keywords based on Michael’s responses for his command line program to run password checks with.

ELLIOT: And your security question, favorite baseball team?

MICHAEL (O.S.): Um, Yankees. I don't remember this being a security question--

ELLIOT: And lastly, your pet's name?

MICHAEL (O.S.): Um, Flipper. Who am I speaking to? Can I get your name and number--

Elliot disconnects and focuses on his command line program.

ELLIOT (V.O.): With those details plus a dictionary brute-force attack, it'll take my program maybe two minutes to crack his password.

While he waits, Elliot goes on Facebook and looks up Angela. He scans through the pictures of her and Ollie. Christmas vacations, Halloween, beach parties, barbecues, etc.

ELLIOT (V.O.): What I wouldn't give to be normal. To live in that bubble, the reality of the naive.

He switches Facebook accounts to Krista, his therapist. More happy pictures.

ELLIOT (V.O.): That's how I justify this. To keep their optimism intact. To protect them.

His password program BEEPS. He switches screens hurriedly and discovers the program didn’t come up with a single match.

ELLIOT (V.O.): How? He's too old to have a complicated password. It had to have been a combination of these things.

Elliot puts his head down and thinks.

ELLIOT (V.O.): I'm missing something, I'm missing something, I'm missing something. Michael Hansen isn't his real name.

He slouches as he rocks back and forth in his chair. He looks up, realizing what he missed.

ELLIOT (V.O.): Michael Hansen isn’t his real name.

EXT. 306 HAWTHORNE AVENUE - NIGHT
Michael walks down his street pushing a baby in a stroller. His WIFE walks next to him. They exchange words before she heads into the corner convenience store and he walks towards their apartment building, still pushing the stroller. We now see he’s also walking Flipper, his dog. Elliot sits on his stoop, in his hoodie, smoking a cigarette, waiting for him.

Elliot’s silhouette takes Michael by surprise.

ELLIOT: Lenny Shannon? Michael Hansen? Which one are you playing tonight? You're going to stop seeing Krista.

The sound of her name immediately makes Michael’s eyes grow wide. Elliot stands and faces him.

MICHAEL: What the fu--

ELLIOT: You're going to break up with her. You're never going to see her again.

MICHAEL (recognizing him): You're the guy that used my phone--

ELLIOT: You cheated on your current wife with seven different women. I got digital proof of all of it.

Stunned, Michael remains still. His wife stands in line at the checkout.

ELLIOT: Ashley Madison, online escorts, fake Facebook pages. I own it all. And if you don't stop seeing her, your wife will know everything along with the police.

MICHAEL: The police?

ELLIOT: Yeah, one of the escorts was 15.

Elliot shows Michael a picture of one of the escorts. Michael puts his head down with a wince.

ELLIOT (V.O.): That 15 part I made up, but he did have a proclivity for young escorts that helped the lie.

ELLIOT: But I'm not gonna do any of that as long as you break up with Krista. Tonight.

Michael looks up at him, now out of fear. His wife is putting away her wallet and is about to walk out.

MICHAEL: Done.

ELLIOT: You're also gonna tell her the truth. That you're married, cheat on your wife, you hire hookers. That you never had any intention of being serious with her.

MICHAEL: Why? That would destroy her. She thinks that...we're in love.

ELLIOT (V.O.): Exactly. Krista needs to avoid dickheads like you in the future. Her radar needs fixing.

ELLIOT: I'll know if you skip any detail. So don't.

Michael nods quickly as his wife exits the store.

ELLIOT: And one more thing I’m gonna need something from you.

INT. ELLIOT’S LOFT - NIGHT
Elliot brings Michael’s dog, Flipper, home. He gives Flipper some dog food. The dog chows down happily.

ELLIOT: Hmm. I like you, Flipper. You're cool.

MOMENTS LATER

ELLIOT (V.O.): I never want to be right about my hacks, but people always find a way to disappoint.

Elliot is on his computer burning a CD. The folder he’s copying is called MICHAEL_HANSEN. Once the burn is complete, he pulls out a sharpie and labels it PINK FLOYD - WISH YOU WERE HERE.

ELLIOT (V.O.): Michael Hansen now gets filed away among the others. Forever buried in my digital cemetery.

He grabs a large CD Case from underneath his bed and flips it open. Several other CDs labeled everything from the BEATLES to ZEPPELIN are in there. He files the newly fake-labeled CD and sends the envelope back under his bed. He jumps back on his computer and with a single keystroke deletes the Michael Hansen folder.
INT. PSYCHOLOGIST’S OFFICE - DAY
Elliot sits in his usual chair. He looks at Krista, who looks disheveled and completely out of it.

ELLIOT (V.O.): The look of disillusionment. He told her. She cried all night. Now comes the sadness. I don't like seeing her sad.

ELLIOT: You okay?

KRISTA: Sorry. Sorry. Go on.

ELLIOT: I think Angela blames me for what happened at the Evil Corp meeting. What do I do? I need to talk to her.

KRISTA: I think you just answered your own question. Talk to her.

ELLIOT: She won't respond to any of my texts or emails.

KRISTA (pointed): Then go to her in person. Tell her you need to talk. Communication is key, Elliot. Real human interaction. That's what's important for you right now.

Elliot understands, he can’t meet her eye contact.
INT. ALLSAFE OFFICES - DAY
Elliot quickly walks into the office. Angela sees him and begins to walk away. He tries to catch up.

ELLIOT: Hey. Do you..do you think we can talk?

ANGELA: What?

ELLIOT: You won't talk to me. You haven't talked to me since the meeting.

ANGELA: I don't want to talk to you because I feel embarrassed every time I think about what happened. Okay? It's fine. I'll get over it.

ELLIOT: It’s been three weeks--

ANGELA: I have to get back to work--

ELLIOT: You're just going to ignore me?

ANGELA: You didn't have to stick up for me in there. I know that you were just trying to help, just don't do it again. Even if I'm losing. Let me lose, okay? Don't look confused. Just say it. Okay?

ELLIOT: ...Okay.

Elliot nods. She puts her head down, disappointed in herself. Though this is awkward for him, Elliot slowly hugs her.

ANGELA: Elliot.

A momentary hesitation as they eye each other. The moment quickly feels like it could be a kiss. But then Elliot and Angela realize eyes are looking at them. They slowly turn only to realize the entire office is looking at the television screens past the pair. Gideon steps in and umutes the television.

ON TV:
Terry Colby is arrested by FBI and taken into custody. A MSNBC banner reads:

BREAKING NEWS - TERRY COLBY ARRESTED - CTO of Evil Corp in custody after investigation into hacking scandal.

Elliot’s eyes go wide.
EXT. NEW YORK STREETS - DAY
Elliot walks down the street, no longer in a zombified, shiftless state-- but with life and purpose.

ELLIOT (V.O.) (incredulous): It’s happening. It’s happening. It’s happening. It’s happening.

Elliot stops in Times Square and looks at the TV’s around him announcing news of the disastrous Evil Corp scandal. Pure amazement and joy begin to fill his face as he takes in the sight.

ELLIOT (V.O.) (incredulous): It’s happening. It’s happening. It’s happening. It’s happening.

He stretches his arms out like he’s just won the gold--

A MAN IN BLACK walks up to him. Elliot’s smiles is long gone.

MAN IN BLACK: Sir, step inside the car.

Other MEN IN BLACK stand behind Elliot. Sweating immediately, Elliot even notices POLICE looking the other way.

MAN IN BLACK: Sir. Get inside the vehicle. Now.
Helpless, Elliot slowly climbs in. Their car, a black Escalade, peels out.
EXT. NYC STREETS - DAY
The first MAN IN BLACK opens the door for Elliot to exit the car. They close him on all sides as they march towards a gargantuan skyscraper.
INT. SKY RISE - ELEVATOR (MOVING) - DAY
A nervous wreck, Elliot stands in the high speed elevator as it quickly climbs several stories into the air.

The elevator DINGS when it reaches the top floor. The doors open and Elliot looks out into the hall, pale as if he’s facing the gallows.

MAN IN BLACK: Go ahead.

Nervously, Elliot stares back at the MAN IN BLACK.

MAN IN BLACK: Sir, go on in.

Elliot looks down the hall again, it assumes a dizzingly blurry form as we see silhouettes dance in the room at it’s edge.

MAN IN BLACK: Sir, go on in.

INT. TOP FLOOR - CONTINUOUS
Elliot enters alone. He sees a number of MEN circle around a grand conference table. We only see their silhouettes, as they bicker and argue with one another.
Elliot’s silhouette now joins them, dead center in the mess of black outlines.

Realizing that Elliot has shown up, their loud arguing hushes into an abrupt silence. The dark shadows now face Elliot, who remains catatonic.

What follows is the longest silence of Elliot’s life as he and the dark faces exchange long, tense stares. No one speaks.

One blurred face leans forward, Tyrell Wellick. He’s wearing a thin smile.

TYRELL: Bonsoir, Elliot.
ELLIOT (V.O.): Please tell me you’re seeing this too...

Up for delivery, who can you trust
When you chose the ops
Probably go off with the cop
'Cause niggas sittin' on the clock
I'm paranoid, more power, more problems
More thoughts to follow, my partner switchin'

But half of the time I just feel insignificant
Incapable, intoxicated

As I look at the cards in my hand
The fortune teller of the tarots says terror
I'm sick of artists that chuck up the deuce
When they get the juice when you helped from the roots
And I'm sick of hoes that walk in and seduce
But then talkin' shit once you give 'em the boot, ahem
Clear your throat 'cause you know you a swallower
Up to me? I would kill the whole lot of ya
So it's part two to Hell or High Water, huh?
Test your gangsta but went Law & Order, huh?

Bow down to the wave lord, send them presi and save yours
For my gat imma save yall, but that's back in the day
I'm a black panther activist, had to miss
School for the meetings on Saturn and outta this world
You are outta your mind, I'm so high in grind mode
Jukin' and vibin' thru life, my life is my ice, nice
Feel like I married my wife, so I hit it more than twice
Immortalized I am more than nice
Even way back in the days was known as I got vice
Gotta get put on the lights or get put on the pavement
Better run for your life
Hard times, hard to reminisce
But I know my future bright
I am the future went back to the future twice
Just to save everybody life, with waves nigga

Bitch I got too many waves, bitch I got too many ways
Sometimes I’m stuck in my ways, that’s just the way I was raised
Remember back in the day, rockin’ them Trick Daddy braids
Facing a blunt to the face, gotta escape all the hate
Bitch I got too many waves, bitch I got too many ways
Sometimes I’m stuck in my ways, that’s just the way I was raised
Remember back in the day, rockin’ them Trick Daddy braids

[Verse 2: Denzel Curry]
Too many waves
Too many waves
Using my government name
Stuck in my ways
Sometimes I feel like I'm born a mistake
But you couldn't relate
Cause you can't imitate
Copy dat, you're a clone I'm Jango Fett
Who wanna get it with the murderous set
Kill a motherfucker like a VHS
Cause we don't play so I eject
Going like a free man no Woodcrest
Red light back and infinite access off of my access
Thinking no answers that's an exit
Wait
Nigga that wasn't the exit
There was no message
Flow like a radical leftist
Black as my right and left fist
Bitch uh
[Bridge: Denzel Curry]
People try to change my mind but I’m sorry I decline, got my mind made up, made up hey
Even when the world is fine I sit back and I recline and I never change up, change up, hey

Bitch I got too many waves, bitch I got too many ways
Sometimes I’m stuck in my ways, that’s just the way I was raised

Yeah, still fuckin' 'til six in the morn'
Son, how I flooded out the wrist to reward
Damn, they don't make 'em like this anymore
Don't try to hold that, you can't control that
I bought the 'Rari, the Tesla, then I got the throwback
I used to ride it, the Honda that was black as Kodak
And I recall it, like a picture, that is, really, that's sick
Big screen lyrics, yeah, sixteen nearin', and
""Zay, 'fore you leave, Can you fuck me in the mirror?"" Yeah
Baby, I got too many bitches not to mention them
Hoes, I don't evеn know they names but they bе feelin' it tough
They wanna touch me like under covers and anacondas
Before you fuckin' go purchase your Gary Paytons
I'm really not everybody, sippin' and talkin' bad as yo' daddy
You shouldn't fuck with these niggas, we was the reckless

[Verse 2: REASON]
Yeah, I fuck my bitch when I'm bored, rich from the poor
Drunk, high, stumblin' off the shits and record

Fuck you think they callin' me, ""Him?"" I'm a competitor

Shit, why you think we Top Dawgs? Niggas different, uh
I been that nigga since Hov was Big Pimpin'
Fly nigga, ain't no gravity, damn
Say somethin' slick, we on your line like a family plan
I used to throw up gang signs out my granny new van
Just some young hood niggas with no guidance like Drake and Chris
My latest shit, make niggas elevate they pen
My new chick always say she ain't no basic bitch
Well, tell me why we always argue over basic shit? That's crazy
2020, we can burn one
I done took way too many Ls and I ain't earned some
No more buyin' bags for bitches that can't afford one
No more gettin' brain from bitches that I can't learn from
Look, we done went from H to the Izzo
To now a bunch of niggas and bitches with all gimmicks
Show they ass more than Lizzo, shit (That's my baby, haha)

Lookin' from crumbs in the cracks of a couch in a mad house
I laugh out loud at shit I'm mad 'bout
Cash cow or mad cow if I ever cashed out
Backpedals and tackles just turn into the rap route
Mac robbin' niggas with MACs after he maxed out
Called him again, minimum chance he get back out

Oblivious to the fact the candy lady was a trap house
Slidin' through the city, I'm like Sly and the Stones

And I will not be wrong,"" next stop we home (Yeah)

Don't ask no names, just pray that you not one
I ain't playin' with these niggas but they still is my sons
And fuck your top five if I ain't your top one
These raps written in blood, I got little for buzz
Know how I'm feelin' this bud, I'm the king of my city
Not gon' fiddle with love, but ain't nobody to trust if niggas ain't with the fuss
I see through the poker face, dawg I'm calling the bluff
I shine like a multifaceted gem in the rough
I'm passionate with every pen that I touch
It's like I wrote this shit in cursive
God MC flow, nigga these is Bible verses
The feature feet on the clue to hearses
Same thing you gifted with is what your beat cursed with

[Verse 5: WESTSIDE BOOGIE]
Yeah, yeah, uh
Who left the bricks on the floor, we too big on the boards
Well, smooth nigga off the bench, I'ma score
I could hit a million hoes, that's legit, but I'm sure
They don't make 'em like my bitch anymore, who let these kids in the door
You was 'posed to keep it closed, now they in here throwing stones
And break the window to my soul, ain't no remote chance in hell I ever let 'em get control, uh
I surf the 'Gram and see the wave you niggas rode, go to the board for the lesson
I be transparent with you, just don't be projecting
Who taught you to be armed and use your guard as a weapon?
Who told you, hit your shell every time you feel threatened?
You know that I've been stressed, I smoked a quarter by afternoon
I walk with an attitude, I gave you niggas change and got no token of gratitude
Like what I gotta do to make you tap in?
I might fuck around, start beefin' with my rap friends, fuck you REASON
[Verse 6: Denzel Curry]
Before we roam, let me go back to the start
'Cause art imitates life and life imitates art
Once we start to dive in this knowledge and this wisdom
They gon' always wanna box us in like it's cubism
Knew about Picasso before I was a snot-nose
Before I had a pot to piss in, and for a hot stone
Pressure is like walkin' across hot coal
I'm cooler than a North Face in Norway, Oslo
Everybody on this track is known to slay shit
JID gave me a reason to snap on Zay shit
Toy with my emotions, I am not one to play with
I'm rappin' with these Top Dawgs, to chill with my down bitch
That is no lie, I'm a nice guy and a wise guy
With a bright mind fresh out of Muay Thai
Don't like to beef with niggas 'cause they all pie
Only time they really caught a body was in Far Cry
Try to bring the Grammy to the crib, that's it
Why die to be a legend when I live that shit?
You could talk about my music, I don't give two shits because
Sooner or later you gon' ride my dick
Icarus if I fall off, but Imma soar
Like a sprained ankle when landed on the floor
If you don't like the song, here's the exit door
'Cause they don't really make 'em like- (JetsonMade another one)

Bitch we've been bored, I wish we could tour
Girl you need Christ, not Christian Dior
Why you keep trying to take pics with me for?
Damn, they don't make 'em like this anymore
A white boy broke her heart back in high school
Now she told me she ain't takin' white dick anymore
""Damn, are you sure?"" Cried when she don't get her way
""Damn, are you four?"" Stole her heart, now I'm tryna slide in the getaway
The game chose me, baby I didn't get a say
I done watched a lot of rappers rise and disintegrate
Paid attention to the styles I'm finna demonstrate, this is how you do it mane
World's gettin' too insane, turned a check into a chain
Tuggin' on a new earrher NuvaRing, we are not the same
If you fuckin' with my crew then you got the right brothers like we flew a plane
Don't ask me about it, let your boo explain (Look)

I said as much as it makes you feels sideways
Smokin' up like every day is friday
Rollin' up while I'm smokin' I ain't even leave my fuckin' driveway
Flickin' joints while I'm on the highway

All of my people be blunted, step in this bitch

All of your people be on me, so back up for we start dabbin' nigga whut
I'm alive why of the blunt, hope you not a bum 'cause we finna tear this shit up
Twenty grams that's ten blunts, nigga light it up

Still not content or satisfied
Been through hell don’t you think I deserve to see paradise
Know the forces of heaven got me protected till the afterlife
Always been the family afterthought don’t worry momma through God we gone get what our heart desire
Spoke what I needed into the universe you niggas wrong for hatin’ my dreams
I got strong faith in, so tell me how the fuck it would not appear
Shit it’s RoS bitch, put my heart on the pen before I wrote this
Police killin’ unarmed black men like we ain’t got soul, shit
It’s a lot I’m dealin’ wit?
I keep a lot of my feelings in
So I,  so I write cause it’s too much I be holdin’ in
Pain sendin’ prayers adolescences to those sobbin’
All my nigga wanted to do is stack up the dough till it’s not foldin’
But they noticed, so fuck 12 boy y’all hatin’ phony like I’m not goin’
I know I’m outspoken, watch y’all eat while I’m malnourished
Fuck nigga what you sayin’ boy we will rise above everything and flourish
Like my ex she broke my heart now she
Nonexistent hopin’ I have a malfunction
Wishin’ me bad like, we were Bonnie and Clyde
Money where ya loyalty lies, wasn’t built off nothing but vice
I know so, so I motivate the hustle and grind

I feel so stoned, disconnected and attracted to you

My piss is a blessing to me like a reverend I bless you with bullets
For thinking bout checking in love with my weapon no voice can contest I spit you like liquids I'm leaving you bitches
I have no remorse
I'll take your life like they took mine when I was born
I had no choice I had to move it off the porch I had to get rich
I split you up like it's the divorce
I'm killing you all these clips peel you off like leaves in the fall
Just want marijuana and money that's all

[SDot Brady] Verse 3

But you niggas better get to cripping cause we the pyru
You know you are not b l double o d, fuck that or my family

[Caleb Stone] Verse 4
Black out drunk and i hiccup
Two bad hoes in my pickup
My dogs sick em
You looking like a leg but i've never been a victim
And i put them on a stroll when i pimp them
Jigga
I'm hot
With the money on the green dot
Livin by the g code
Feelin on the g spot
I just put a couple hundred on my brothers books
I just spent a coule bands on some stripper puss
She don't even wanna know my name
She wanna love me like Novacaine
I don't even wanna cure the pain
I just wanna run the coldest game
So she gave me the payment
I gave her the placement
Spread the legs open
Exploring her basement
Straight from the under
Ground for the summer
Chelsea my squad but i know some gunnersEmbed"

Black M,GOATED. (Mixed),"3 ContributorsThe Two Dead Girls, Chapter One LyricsThis happened in 1932, when the state penitentiary was
still at Cold Mountain. And the electric chair was there, too,
of course.
The inmates made jokes about the chair the way people
always make jokes about things that frighten them but
can't be gotten away from. They called it Old Sparky, or the
Big Juicy. They made cracks about the Power bill, and how
Warden Moores would cook his Thanksgiving dinner that
fall, with his wife, Melinda, too sick to cook.

But for the ones who actually had to sit down in that chair,
the humor went out of the situation in a hurry. I presided
over seventy-eight executions during my time at Cold
Mountain (that's one figure I've never been confused
about; I'll remember it on my deathbed), and I think that,
for most of those men, the truth of what was happening to
them finally hit all the way home when their ankles were
being damped to the stout oak of ""Old Sparky's"" legs. The
realization came then (you would see it rising in their eyes,
a kind of cold dismay) that their, own legs had finished
their careers. The blood still ran in them, the muscles were
still strong, but they were finished, all the same; they were
never going to walk another country mile or dance with a
girl at a barn-raising. Old Sparky's clients came to a
knowledge of their deaths from the ankles up. There was a
black silk bag that went over their heads after they had
finished their rambling and mostly disjointed last remarks.
It was supposed to be for them, but I always thought it was
really for us, to keep us from seeing the awful tide of
dismay in their eyes as they realized they were going to
die with their knees bent.
There was no death row at Cold Mountain, only E Block, set
apart from the other four and about a quarter their size,
brick instead of wood, with a horrible bare metal roof that
glared in the summer sun like a delirious eyeball. Six cells
inside, three on each side of a wide center aisle, each
almost twice as big as the cells in the other four blocks.
Singles, too. Great accommodations for a prison (especially
in the thirties), but the inmates would have traded for cells
in any of the other four. Believe me, they would have
traded.

There was never a time during my years as block
superintendent when all six cells were occupied at one time
-- thank God for small favors. Four was the most, mixed
black and white (at Cold Mountain, there was no
segregation among the walking dead), and that was a little
piece of hell. One was a woman, Beverly McCall. She was
black as the ace of spades and as beautiful as the sin you
never had nerve enough to commit. She put up with six
years of her husband beating her, but wouldn't put up with
his creeping around for a single day. On the evening after
she found out he was cheating, she stood waiting for the
unfortunate Lester McCall, known to his pals (and,
presumably, to his extremely short-term mistress) as
Cutter, at the top of the stairs leading to the apartment
over his barber shop. She waited until he got his overcoat
half off, then dropped his cheating guts onto his tu-tone
shoes. Used one of Cutter's own razors to do it. Two nights
before she was due to sit in Old Sparky, she called me to
her cell and said she had been visited by her African
spirit-father in a dream. He told her to discard her
slave-name and to die under her free name, Matuomi.
That was her request, that her deathwarrant should be read
under the name of Beverly Matuomi. I guess her
spirit-father didn't give her any first name, or one she
could make out, anyhow. I said yes, okay, fine. One thing
those years serving as the bull-goose screw taught me was
never to refuse the condemned unless I absolutely had to.
In the case of Beverly Matuomi, it made no difference,
anyway. The governor called the next day around three in
the afternoon, commuting her sentence to life in the
Grassy Valley Penal Facility for Women -- all penal and no
penis, we used to say back then. I was glad to see Bev's
round ass going left instead of right when she got to the
duty desk, let me tell you.
Thirty-five years or so later -- had to be at least thirty-five
-- I saw that name on the obituary page of the paper,
under a picture of a skinny-faced black lady with a cloud of
white hair and glasses with rhinestones at the corners. It
was Beverly. She'd spent the last ten years of her life a
free woman, the obituary said, and had rescued the
small-town library of Raines Falls pretty much
single-handed. She had also taught Sunday school and
had been much loved in that little backwater. LIBRARIAN
DIES OF HEART FAILURE, the headline said, and below
that, in smaller type, almost as an afterthought: Served
Over Two Decades in Prison for Murder. Only the eyes, wide
and blazing behind the glasses with the rhinestones at the
comers, were the same. They were the eyes of a woman
who even at seventy-whatever would not hesitate to pluck a
safety razor from its blue jar of disinfectant, if the urge
seemed pressing. You know murderers, even if they finish
up as old lady librarians in dozey little towns. At least you
do if you've spent as much time minding murderers as I
did. There was only one time I ever had a question about
the nature of my job. That, I reckon, is why I'm writing this.

The wide corridor up the center of E Block was floored with
linoleum the color of tired old limes, and so what was
called the Last Mile at other prisons was called the Green
Mile at Cold Mountain. It ran, I guess, sixty long paces
from south to north, bottom to top. At the bottom was the
restraint room. At the top end was a T-junction. A left turn
meant life -- if you called what went on in the sunbaked
exercise yard life, and many did; many lived it for years,
with no apparent ill effects. Thieves and arsonists and sex
criminals, all talking their talk and walking their walk and
making their little deals.
A right turn, though -- that was different. First you went into
my office (where the carpet was also green, a thing I kept
meaning to change and not getting around to), and
crossed in front of my desk, which was flanked by the
American flag on the left and the state flag on the right.
On the far side were two doors. One led into the small
W.C. that I and the E Block guards (sometimes even
Warden Moores) used; the other opened on a kind of
storage shed. This was where you ended up when you
walked the Green Mile.

It was a small door -- I had to duck my head when I went
through, and John Coffey actually had to sit and scoot. You
came out on a little landing, then went down three cement
steps to a board floor. It was a miserable room without
heat and with a metal roof, just like the one on the block
to which it was an adjunct. It was cold enough in there to
see your breath during the winter, and stifling in the
summer. At the execution of Elmer Manfred -- in July or
August of '30, that one was, I believe -- we had nine
witnesses pass out.

On the left side of the storage shed -- again -- there was
life. Tools (all locked down in frames crisscrossed with
chains, as if they were carbine rifles instead of spades and
pickaxes), dry goods, sacks of seeds for spring planting in
the prison gardens, boxes of toilet paper, pallets
cross-loaded with blanks for the prison plate-shop...even
bags of lime for marking out the baseball diamond and
the football gridiron -- the cons played in what was known
as The Pasture, and fall afternoons were greatly looked
forward to at Cold Mountain.

On the right -- once again -- death. Old Sparky his
ownself, sitting up on a plank platform at the southeast
comer of the storeroom, stout oak legs, broad oak arms
that had absorbed the terrorized sweat of scores of men in
the last few minutes of their lives, and the metal cap,
usually hung jauntily on the back of the chair, like some
robot kid's beanie in a Buck Rogers comic-strip. A cord ran
from it and through a gasket-circled hole in the cinderblock
wall behind the chair. Off to one side was a galvanized tin
bucket. If you looked inside it, you would see a circle of
sponge, cut just right to fit the metal cap. Before
executions, it was soaked in brine to better conduct the
charge of direct-current electricity that ran through the wire,
through the sponge, and into the condemned man's brain.

'Cause these streets ain't safe, at your wait, when I make a statement

Niggas on that duffel shit, too low to the fuckin' key (Yeah)
Reppin' me, I get Aquarius Killa, that nigga like Purrp, rock keep the G

Black M,HARD AF,"1 ContributorKing Kong LyricsVerse 1
Waddup Akwasi ik heb je back
Je moest eens weten ik heb mad love voor wat je zegt
Kom uit de trap en ik kan preachen net als Malcolm X
Open minded dus je weet ik hou never mn back
Voor al die whites chicks die mn dick sucken
My dick aint free je moet dit snappen
Zo niet is het “Hooi” en niks anders
Black men en ga mezelf never witwassen
Lieve schat jij hebt white privilege
Jij weet helemaal niks over van een lijf zoals ik
En heel veel voordelen, want jij blijft gewoon wit
Institutionalized, jij blijft een racist
Rationeel, maar emotioneel is het fucking heavy
Enough is enough, dus we schoppen herrie
Open je bek deze tijd wees niet scary
Black lives matter by any means necessary


Hook
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
Ja mn dick is scary en m'n haar is kroes
Grote lippen, grote neus, zelfs een grote voet
Melanine pigment ja dat zit in mn bloed
Ik ben een king kong, king kong, king kong
Bitch ik ben een king kong, king kong, king kong

Verse 2
400 jaar, generaties lang
Geen scholing en ze namen onze namen af
Hard werken voor niks voor jouw vaderland
Zodat jouw vader kan genieten in babylon
Wij zwarten hebben 10-0 achterstand
Wonen in een achterstandswijk, wat een rattenval
Vind je het gek dat ik onderaan de ladder kwam
Door die erfenis heb jij tonnen op je bank
Zeg me ken jij Willie Lynch
Keep the body, take the mind for hundred years
Eigenlijk heb ik niet eens tijd meer dit
Maar mn zelf uiten is voor mij verplicht


Hook
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
Ja mn dick is scary en m'n haar is kroes

Black M,HEADCRACK INTERLUDE,"7 ContributorsThee Cipher, Part II Lyrics[Verse 1: KUZGUN]
Headless Vegas strippers with blood and cocaine on their asses
I was spawn from rotten condoms, dropped to the earth to cause problems, faggot
Dropping classics, fuck rotten Catholics, you a forgotten dramatic
I got that Benz up waiting, these rappers menstruating, them niggas melodramatic
Only living motherfucker that spawns dulics and makes spondulicks
And makes blood and every other possible fluid start oozing
I’m the official rapping aborted fetus necrophilliac
You just a torn shit-eater we know’s really wack
That’s an 10-syllable rhyme for you ignoramuses
I’m simply aiming this at these lame as shit, aimless tricks
Any life anyone pretends to live, I really live it too
Fuck, I’m lazy, I’ll just let this be a 12-bar interlude

[Verse 2: Didact]
My words speak for they self
When you mentioning wealth
You better be counting your bread
Dead Prez Heads, pussies biting out it like Adam’s apple
Diced Pineapples, running circles round y'all
Game locked like monitor bracelets round niggas ankles
Got rappers in shambles, turn tables ‘round
Aiming, 1 eye closed, leaning back
Wearing some leather sandals
Example, I put trifectas in vandals craniums
Playing the game wicked, 50 tickets at your local Playdium
Wait, seats for 50 at your local Stadium, paining em’
Spitting cursively, purposely like Desiigner brothers
Motherfuckers, verse for a hearse placement, Throne vacant
Taking it like jackets of niggas who lacking
Can’t go easy my nigga what’s bracking
Squad attacking your establishment
Establishing kingdoms, right over top of yours
Art of war, build and build and build
We here to take it down and destroy
Walk in your city like troy, all for the heels of the boys
Something soft, 50 vicodins feeling right
Higher than Houston got a problem
Name's Dwight, flight attendant better land the flight
70 years too far from seeing Heaven’s light
Is it all for spite?
Or do I really kill these artists for better nights
Or for worse days
I swear this pain is a substance that never goes
It Never goes astray
Y'all pseudo-intellectuals gotta go away
You might also like[Verse 3: Murkman]
I'll assault triflely and silently, like a fox, nay to Silento
When blasting in the manner of going H.A.M.,  in a soliloquy of this solo
The same way, Kanye would go ad-lib with a choir loop
Of his ""HAN!""'s,  on BG repeat indefinitely
Until all 6 intros to George's films, scroll long enough to turn you into a Romeiro
Definitely, the right kind of defined criteria, of ""Yeezy the type of nigga""
To do that thing at a specified rate of time, not in any right-angled frame of mind
The only one capable of handling, out of hand situations
So, I traded my mic rapier, for a Darth Knight's light saber
Fuck being flyer than any baller, fool, I don't travel around you court jesters
I write and a kin to Luke, I'm a skywalker, so I don't need to be a dweller
Steal my lines, I'll lop off your left hand, put to the dark side of the path
A cloaked Muslim, with the sithest of intentions, alright?
Transport you to the Pharcyde, with your Candy Land ass, right NOW not LATER
Push my switches, be reduced to a Pomagranite, aged with the fruit face of Palpatine
I'll raise gravitational hell, razing your sensory perception When using warped, concussion grenades
Having a phase rifle here, is to being a pussy, with the weight of a Sabretooth tiger
From these clouded heights view of a vantage point, that's my advantage
Dissing this Windu of a nigga, doesn't add to yours, a disadvantage
Begging for a death wish, bitch?
I'll emit a scourging burst, from this Timesplitters plasma rifle
The star arriving in the form, of falling planets from the galaxy's line
Feel all that heat compressed in one unit, melting through you Jones clones
That group dashing away to the nearest light, to flee from that darkness, if you stay, see?
Black lives may not matter to you, but in science, dark matter does, proof you need?
Princess Leia fighting for good, amidst the swarthiest of astral plains
Yet where was Stacy, when she dashed fast enough,  hoping to diminish her skin color?
Anyways, I'll have your pooped flukes, of scatter-shot, noob Stormtroops
Dancing in dazed circles of radiated rain, to be Duke Nuked
Rest of you? Well, will have been not well resting, seeing celestial stars
Viewing Star's face, while transported into a dead space
Doom, trekking with no direction in a Stargate system cemetery place
Earth is for those lings, who'd choose to linger, stranded on billion old terrain
I'm beyond being a fire sign, born in the scorching core of Mars, mayne
Which is saying, I won't squander my resources when beginning your end
Ionizing these Mars Bars, to celebrity, stalwart stars, who's warring aren't up to par
They're farther, after I intergalactically catapult them, instantly
To the sun's solar flaring surface, by firing my armory at full capacity
Immediately, ASAP ending any chance, for there to spark,  and start war
What problem we have of you? You hail from Houston? I don't recall your lexicon
Either you from the future, or your past due your dated referential base
Because, y'all warbling Auto-Tune, Wall-E tools keep imitating Tony Montana
From the most South down in Cali, never spoke French, dude
There's a regional boundary line, that shouldn't be crossed, you new?
I don't like aliens, let alone being kind to humans, all destroyed too
Cause, judging from your inflection, you sound like ATLien, shapeshifty ones
Take what my subculture has, your burial area's, gravesite 51
[Verse 4: Daemonum]
Can't stand commandments, sorry Lord but I broke all Ten like I detest the testaments
I said my name six times, peering in the mirror and I appeared, still don't know what the lesson is
Habeas Corpus and the rigors of Ex Mortis, my testimony was ""Klaatu Barada Nikto""
Homicide is evil to all but the dead, stiffened up when they caught me, in flagrante delicto
Consulting the hoi polloi for the vox populi, my soul's on fire so I hit em' with the Third Degree
Cruel and unusual punishment, brain stem wrapped in solar flares, I'm burning up those close to me
Rimmed with brimstone, rawer than the god of the sun
Shawshanked seven serpents with irredeemable darkness
Apophis meditating in lotus, levitating in the seventh circle of hell, chakras ensconced with starkness
Erebus needs a therapist, mind hazardous, kinda like nine basilisks
Acrobatic Atticus with an abacus, groggy and stumbling--so you know where the addict is
Herodes remains flyer than a Finch and he knows How To Flip the Mockingbird to you pacifists
Cadence coming harder than meeting a Gorgon’s gaze
Bludgeoned by the back of a blunderbuss and bathed in the blaze
I’m about as one-track-minded as a Mobius Strip
Harpooned her man like I was straight out of Moby Dick
My flintlock-jaw and spoken steel spheres ignite contingencies of Philistines
Psychological simulacrum of my grotesque proclivities
Got a penchant for bagging mementos, kept her pendant and a bag of ten toes
Striding through Ravenholm, tonguing these Deer Haunter distorted demons
Lambda on the amalgam alpha, radiating The Evil Within my mental beacons
Headcrabs and sprouters, Time to Split, hoping your future’s perfect, not redeeming
Hooked appendages and barbed wire wrapped crowbars, combine mind stems for the citadel’s deacons
Dedicated to the premeditated, heavily medicated
You don't know what I am, with a Bic pen--that's the contaminate
Iambic pentameter, dipping the fountain pen in a pool of my blood
More murders than a flock of crows
Heroes disgust me, along with every deuce he throws
Put the turpitude to the paper, leave homicide to the prose
Felt a devil's god inside, gutter for a grave, and that's without a rose
Similarly, my symphony of sinful similes, symbolize my sickening strife for sophrosyne
Sipping some Chardonnay while I somaticize, saturnine and seeking to slaughter a new dream
Brainpan dripping with venom and the art’s in the arsenic
Prideful of penning this hellfire, am I a writer or an arsonist?
It’s all ashes to ashes—and after; I practice happiness—like I’m a pyro-narcissist
Ones and Zeros coalesce in the death row echelon formation
The dark saint paints the portrait of an enslaved encephalon’s damnation
Apothecaries carry the carrion of the seraphim
Voluminous miasmas echo the haunted prayer hymns
Skulking ghoul, wandering the shadows of Golgotha, sipping Propofol
American Gothic prophet, tailed by an angry mob, pitchfork and all
Bury and quarantine your dead, wrapping up the plagued is the protocol
Literary lantern lit leprosy, coughing up blackness from my soul
Ragged quill spilling illness, pathologically transcribed to the vellum whole
The denouement of Babylon’s pantheon, keep speaking your antiphons
Woebegone Athenians ramble on when I impinge upon the deities in the Parthenon
Untethered plane movement, an interplanetary transcendental phenomenon
A cosmic pantechnicon, light-years of breakneck on a cross-dimensional autobahn
Necrotic automaton, practically a hellbound son of Gilgamesh
Necronomicon, spastically scribed in blood and bound in flesh
Love to compute the arithmetic of witchcraft like HP and Buckland completed the rest—
In pieces, your epitaph’s gravely set in stone, bitch1Embed"

I'm somewhere where these playaz hit
Tell 'em I'm on that same shit

So many niggas on my dick it's like a product
King of the streets, stoned up
Everybody want a truce so I owned up
HOLD IT! wait like a nigga who done blown up
It's k on the back of these blood diamonds
Paint on the whip say ""flood timing""
These bright white lights got a thug blinder
Yeah, bitch, I made this thug shine
As always, only way I roll
Fuck a hater, only thing they get told
Heated up, but this wrist so cold
Gonna beat up the block till the block gets swole

Black M,How To Make A Sandwich*,"6 ContributorsFacts Not Fiction Lyrics[Intro]
African-Americans have long been acknowledged for their creativity and genius
In theater, dance, music, art and literature
But there's another kind of creative contribution African-Americans have made
And that's the art of invention
(Helluva made this beat, baby)

[Verse 1: E-40]
My people don't get they props, it's not a mystery
Bet y'all didn't know there was a black man named Nearest Green
That taught Jack Daniels how to make whiskey
They wanna leave us up outta history and keep us hidden
Let me break down a few things that we invented
There was a black nurse named Marie Brittan Brown, listen
She invented the first home security system
There's a long list of winners, not no losers
Otis Boykin developed the IBM computer
George Washington Carver invented peanut butter, that's what they say
Have you ever had a sandwich called PB&J?
There more to us than thuggin', jewelry, twerkin', sports, and entertainment
Sellin' dope and murder, funeral arrangements

[Chorus: Stresmatic & E-40]
Peep game, listen (Listen), I make all decisions
Never play both sides, get money then I'm dippin' (Dippin')
Just stay the same, I don't be switchin' (Switchin', what is it?)

He was also granted a patent for the first traffic signal (Oh)

20/20 vision, see the future from a distance
That's So Raven, Miyagi's a little different
In my premonition, I only picture my infants
Rugrats, skip all the talk about Dr. Lipschitz
Tryna keep the balance, be honorable and sadistic
Lost a lot of homies, but in my dreams they revisit
Lookin' at the world without lookin' forward to Christmas
Should I be a Buddhist, Jehovah's Witness or Christian?
Satan's out the question
With the way the industry ran, you gotta have a fuckin' death wish
Just to get views or to be viewed as a legend
But call a nigga corny when you hear he got a message
Damn, I know a nigga preachin' like a reverend
My head is out the box like Seven
Call me Pandora, martial arts elevate my aura
Fire spit make you tempura
There is no order, I am number one, fuck a top five
Yeah, them other niggas cool, but brodie, they are not live
For the fact, them other niggas are not I
Too fly, compare me to Marty McFly
No Biggie, I'm rappin' like I'm from Bed-Stuy
Bustin' off the top of the dome, my mind is war cry
Truthfully the realest of all and that is no lie
Put me on the track with the best and they'll be no tie

Fightin' demons in holy water to cover my steps
Walk through the fire, I'd rather die than to give my respect
Well protected, a deadly weapon that can't be concealed
On that hunt just like a lion, but I walk through the field
While they was hatin', oh, I was makin' my way up the hill
Huh, and they coulda all followed
Belly of the beast, you always headed to the bottom
It's an unseen problem, got the underscene poppin'
I'm a real show stopper, real proper, real Don Dada
You could call me daddy, just know I will not father
And I will not sponsor anything I make
And anything, I need a hot dollar, I don't need a dumb model
Need a hot scholar, like I'm Van Wilder
Cause anything I do, I'm known to take that shit skyward
Uh, now it's time get up like I was too excited
Successes in my horizon
I'm headed towards where they light is, nobody real can deny this

Black M,​internet triforce,"2 ContributorsThe Marriage Plot LyricsTo start with, look at all the books. There were her Edith Wharton novels, arranged not by title but date of publication; there was the complete Modern Library set of Henry James, a gift from her father on her twenty-first birthday; there were the dog-eared paperbacks assigned in her college courses, a lot of Dickens, a smidgen of Trollope, along with good helpings of Austen, George Eliot, and the redoubtable Brontë sisters.

There were a whole lot of black-and-white New Directions paperbacks, mostly poetry by people like H.D. or Denise Levertov.There were the Colette novels she read on the sly.

There was the first edition of Couples, belonging to her mother, which Madeleine had surreptitiously dipped into back in sixth grade and which she was using now to provide textual support in her English honors thesis on the marriage plot.

There was, in short, this mid-size but still portable library representing pretty much everything Madeleine had read in college, a collection of texts, seemingly chosen at random, whose focus slowly narrowed, like a personality test, a sophisticated one you couldn’t trick by anticipating the implications of its questions and finally got so lost in that your only recourse was to answer the simple truth.

And then you waited for the result, hoping for “Artistic,” or “Passionate,” thinking you could live with “Sensitive,” secretly fearing “Narcissistic” and “Domestic,” but finally being presented with an outcome that cut both ways and made you feel different depending on the day, the hour, or the guy you happened to be dating: “Incurably Romantic.”

These were the books in the room where Madeleine lay, with a pillow over her head, on the morning of her college graduation. She’d read each and every one, often multiple times, frequently underlining passages, but that was no help to her now.

Madeleine was trying to ignore the room and everything in it. She was hoping to drift back down into the oblivion where she’d been safely couched for the last three hours.

Any higher level of wakefulness would force her to come to grips with certain disagreeable facts: for instance, the amount and variety of the alcohol she’d imbibed last night, and the fact that she’d gone to sleep with her contacts in.

Thinking about such specifics would, in turn, call to mind the reasons she’d drunk so much in the first place, which she definitely didn’t want to do. And so Madeleine adjusted her pillow, blocking out the early morning light, and tried to fall back to sleep.

But it was useless. Because right then, at the other end of her apartment, the doorbell began to ring.

Early June, Providence, Rhode Island, the sun up for almost two hours already, lighting up the pale bay and the smokestacks of the Narragansett Electric factory, rising like the sun on the Brown University seal emblazoned on all the pennants and banners draped up over campus, a sun with a sagacious face, representing knowledge.

But this sun—the one over Providence—was doing the metaphorical sun one better, because the founders of the university, in their Baptist pessimism, had chosen to depict the light of knowledge enshrouded by clouds, indicating that ignorance had not yet been dispelled from the human realm, whereas the actual sun was just now fighting its way through cloud cover, sending down splintered beams of light and giving hope to the squadrons of parents, who’d been soaked and frozen all weekend, that the unseasonable weather might not ruin the day’s festivities.

All over College Hill, in the geometric gardens of the Georgian mansions, the magnolia-scented front yards of Victorians, along brick sidewalks running past black iron fences like those in a Charles Addams cartoon or a Lovecraft story; outside the art studios at the Rhode Island School of Design, where one painting major, having stayed up all night to work, was blaring Patti Smith; shining off the instruments (tuba and trumpet, respectively) of the two members of the Brown marching band who had arrived early at the meeting point and were nervously looking around, wondering where everyone else was; brightening the cobblestone side streets that led downhill to the polluted river, the sun was shining on every brass doorknob, insect wing, and blade of grass.
And, in concert with the suddenly flooding light, like a starting gun for all the activity, the doorbell in Madeleine’s fourth-floor apartment began, clamorously, insistently, to ring.

The pulse reached her less as a sound than as a sensation, an electric shock shooting up her spine. In one motion Madeleine tore the pillow off her head and sat up in bed. She knew who was ringing the buzzer.

It was her parents. She’d agreed to meet Alton and Phyllida for breakfast at 7:30. She’d made this plan with them two months ago, in April, and now here they were, at the appointed time, in their eager, dependable way.

That Alton and Phyllida had driven up from New Jersey to see her graduate, that what they were here to celebrate today wasn’t only her achievement but their own as parents, had nothing wrong or unexpected about it.

The problem was that Madeleine, for the first time in her life, wanted no part of it. She wasn’t proud of herself. She was in no mood to celebrate. She’d lost faith in the significance of the day and what the day represented.

She considered not answering. But she knew that if she didn’t answer, one of her roommates would, and then she’d have to explain where she’d disappeared to last night, and with whom. Therefore, Madeleine slid out of the bed and reluctantly stood up.

This seemed to go well for a moment, standing up. Her head felt curiously light, as if hollowed out. But then the blood, draining from her skull like sand from an hourglass, hit a bottleneck, and the back of her head exploded in pain.

In the midst of this barrage, like the furious core from which it emanated, the buzzer erupted again.

She came out of her bedroom and stumbled in bare feet to the intercom in the hall, slapping the SPEAK button to silence the buzzer.

“Hello?”

“What’s the matter? Didn’t you hear the bell?” It was Alton’s voice, as deep and commanding as ever, despite the fact that it was issuing from a tiny speaker.

“Sorry,” Madeleine said. “I was in the shower.”

“Likely story. Will you let us in, please?”
Madeleine didn’t want to. She needed to wash up first.

“I’m coming down,” she said.

This time, she held down the SPEAK button too long, cutting off Alton’s response. She pressed it again and said, “Daddy?” but while she was speaking, Alton must have been speaking, too, because when she pressed LISTEN all that came through was static.

Madeleine took this pause in communications to lean her forehead against the door frame. The wood felt nice and cool.

The thought struck her that, if she could keep her face pressed against the soothing wood, she might be able to cure her headache, and if she could keep her forehead pressed against the door frame for the rest of the day, while somehow still being able to leave the apartment, she might make it through breakfast with her parents, march in the commencement procession, get a diploma, and graduate.

She lifted her face and pressed speak again.

“Daddy?”

But it was Phyllida’s voice that answered. “Maddy? What’s the matter? Let us in.”

“My roommates are still asleep. I’m coming down. Don’t ring the bell anymore.”

“We want to see your apartment!”

“Not now. I’m coming down. Don’t ring.”

She took her hand from the buttons and stood back, glaring at the intercom as if daring it to make a sound. When it didn’t, she started back down the hall. She was halfway to the bathroom when her roommate Abby emerged, blocking the way.

She yawned, running a hand through her big hair, and then, noticing Madeleine, smiled knowingly.
“So,” Abby said, “where did you sneak off to last night?”

“My parents are here,” Madeleine said. “I have to go to breakfast.”

“Come on. Tell me.”

“There’s nothing to tell. I’m late.”

“How come you’re wearing the same clothes, then?”

Instead of replying, Madeleine looked down at herself. Ten hours earlier, when she’d borrowed the black Betsey Johnson dress from Olivia, Madeleine had thought it looked good on her. But now the dress felt hot and sticky, the fat leather belt looked like an S&M restraint, and there was a stain near the hem that she didn’t want to identify.

Abby, meanwhile, had knocked on Olivia’s door and entered. “So much for Maddy’s broken heart,” she said. “Wake up! You’ve got to see this.”

The path to the bathroom was clear. Madeleine’s need for a shower was extreme, almost medical. At a minimum, she had to brush her teeth.

But Olivia’s voice was audible now. Soon Madeleine would have two roommates interrogating her. Her parents were liable to start ringing again any minute. As quietly as possible, she inched back down the hall.

She stepped into a pair of loafers left by the front door, crushing the heels flat as she caught her balance, and escaped into the outer corridor.

The elevator was waiting at the end of the floral runner. Waiting, Madeleine realized, because she’d failed to close the sliding gate when she’d staggered out of the thing a few hours earlier.

Now she shut the gate securely and pressed the button for the lobby, and with a jolt the antique contraption began to descend through the building’s interior gloom.

Madeleine’s building, a Neo-Romanesque castle called the Narragansett that wrapped around the plunging corner of Benefit Street and Church Street, had been built at the turn of the century.

Among its surviving period details—the stained-glass skylight, the brass wall sconces, the marble lobby—was the elevator. Made of curving metal bars like a giant birdcage, the elevator miraculously still functioned, but it moved slowly, and as the car dropped, Madeleine took the opportunity to make herself more presentable.

She ran her hands through her hair, finger-combing it. She polished her front teeth with her index finger. She rubbed mascara crumbs from her eyes and moistened her lips with her tongue. Finally, passing the balustrade on the second floor, she checked her reflection in the small mirror attached to the rear panel.

One of the nice things about being twenty-two, or about being Madeleine Hanna, was that three weeks of romantic anguish, followed by a night of epic drinking, didn’t do much visible damage. Except for puffiness around her eyes, Madeleine looked like the same pretty, dark-haired person as usual.

The symmetries of her face—the straight nose, the Katharine Hepburn–ish cheekbones and jawline—were almost mathematical in their precision. Only the slight furrow in her brow gave evidence of the slightly anxious person that Madeleine felt herself, intrinsically, to be.

She could see her parents waiting below. They were trapped between the lobby door and the door to the street, Alton in a seersucker jacket,

Phyllida in a navy suit and matching gold-buckled purse. For a second, Madeleine had an impulse to stop the elevator and leave her parents stuck in the foyer amid all the college-town clutter—the posters for New Wave bands with names like Wretched Misery or the Clits, the pornographic Egon Schiele drawings by the RISD kid on the second floor, all the clamorous Xeroxes whose subtext conveyed the message that the wholesome, patriotic values of her parents’ generation were now on the ash heap of history, replaced by a nihilistic, post-punk sensibility that Madeleine herself didn’t understand but was perfectly happy to scandalize her parents by pretending that she did—before the elevator stopped in the lobby and she slid open the gate and stepped out to meet them.

Alton was first through the door. “Here she is!” he said avidly. “The college graduate!” In his net-charging way, he surged forward to seize her in a hug. Madeleine stiffened, worried that she smelled of alcohol or, worse, of sex.

“I don’t know why you wouldn’t let us see your apartment,” Phyllida said, coming up next. “I was looking forward to meeting Abby and Olivia. We’d love to treat them to dinner later.”

“We’re not staying for dinner,” Alton reminded her.

“Well, we might. That depends on Maddy’s schedule.”

“No, that’s not the plan. The plan is to see Maddy for breakfast and then leave after the ceremony.”

“Your father and his plans,” Phyllida said to Madeleine. “Are you wearing that dress to the ceremony?”

“I don’t know,” Madeleine said.

“I can’t get used to these shoulder pads all the young women are wearing. They’re so mannish.”

“It’s Olivia’s.”

“You look pretty whacked out, Mad,” Alton said. “Big party last night?”

“Not really.”

“Don’t you have anything of your own to wear?” Phyllida said.

“I’ll have my robe on, Mummy,” Madeleine said, and, to forestall further inspection, headed past them through the foyer.

Outside, the sun had lost its battle with the clouds and vanished. The weather looked not much better than it had all weekend. Campus Dance, on Friday night, had been more or less rained out. The Baccalaureate service on Sunday had proceeded under a steady drizzle.

Now, on Monday, the rain had stopped, but the temperature felt closer to St. Patrick’s than to Memorial Day.

As she waited for her parents to join her on the sidewalk, it occurred to Madeleine that she hadn’t had sex, not really. This was some consolation.

“Your sister sends her regrets,” Phyllida said, coming out.

“She has to take Richard the Lionhearted for an ultrasound today.”

Richard the Lionhearted was Madeleine’s nine-week-old nephew. Everyone else called him Richard.

“What’s the matter with him?” Madeleine asked.

“One of his kidneys is petite, apparently. The doctors want to keep an eye on it. If you ask me, all these ultrasounds do is find things to worry about.”

“Speaking of ultrasounds,” Alton said, “I need to get one on my knee.”

Phyllida paid no attention. “Anyway, Allie’s devastated not to see you graduate. As is Blake. But they’re hoping you and your new beau might visit them this summer, on your way to the Cape.”

You had to stay alert around Phyllida. Here she was, ostensibly talking about Richard the Lionhearted’s petite kidney, and already she’d managed to move the subject to Madeleine’s new boyfriend, Leonard (whom Phyllida and Alton hadn’t met), and to Cape Cod (where Madeleine had announced plans to cohabitate with him). On a normal day, when her brain was working, Madeleine would have been able to keep one step ahead of Phyllida, but this morning the best she could manage was to let the words float past her.

Fortunately, Alton changed the subject. “So, where do you recommend for breakfast?”

Madeleine turned and looked vaguely down Benefit Street. “There’s a place this way.”

She started shuffling along the sidewalk. Walking—moving—seemed like a good idea. She led them past a line of quaint, nicely maintained houses bearing historical placards, and a big apartment building with a gable roof. Providence was a corrupt town, crime-ridden and mob-controlled, but up on College Hill this was hard to see.

The sketchy downtown and dying or dead textile mills lay below, in the grim distance. Here the narrow streets, many of them cobblestone, climbed past mansions or snaked around Puritan graveyards full of headstones as narrow as heaven’s door, streets with names like Prospect, Benevolent, Hope, and Meeting, all of them feeding into the arboreous campus at the top.

The sheer physical elevation suggested an intellectual one.

“Aren’t these slate sidewalks lovely,” Phyllida said as she followed along.

“We used to have slate sidewalks on our street.

They’re much more attractive. But then the borough replaced them with concrete.”

“Assessed us for the bill, too,”

Alton said. He was limping slightly, bringing up the rear. The right leg of his charcoal trousers was swelled from the knee brace he wore on and off the tennis court. Alton had been club champion in his age group for twelve years running, one of those older guys with a sweatband ringing a balding crown, a choppy forehand, and absolute murder in his eyes.

Madeleine had been trying to beat Alton her entire life without success. This was even more infuriating because she was better than he was, at this point. But whenever she took a set from Alton he started intimidating her, acting mean, disputing calls, and her game fell apart.

Madeleine was worried that there was something paradigmatic in this, that she was destined to go through life being cowed by less capable men.

As a result, Madeleine’s tennis matches against Alton had assumed such outsize personal significance for her that she got tight whenever she played him, with predictable results.

And Alton still gloated when he won, still got all rosy and jiggly, as if he’d bested her by sheer talent.

At the corner of Benefit and Waterman, they crossed behind the white steeple of First Baptist Church. In preparation for the ceremony, loudspeakers had been set up on the lawn.

A man wearing a bow tie, a dean-of-students-looking person, was tensely smoking a cigarette and inspecting a raft of balloons tied to the churchyard fence.

By now Phyllida had caught up to Madeleine, taking her arm to negotiate the uneven slate, which was pushed up by the roots of gnarled plane trees that lined the curb. As a little girl, Madeleine had thought her mother pretty, but that was a long time ago. Phyllida’s face had gotten heavier over the years; her cheeks were beginning to sag like those of a camel. The conservative clothes she wore—the clothes of a philanthropist or lady ambassador—had a tendency to conceal her figure. Phyllida’s hair was where her power resided. It was expensively set into a smooth dome, like a band shell for the presentation of that long-running act, her face. For as long as Madeleine could remember, Phyllida had never been at a loss for words or shy about a point of etiquette. Among her friends Madeleine liked to make fun of her mother’s formality, but she often found herself comparing other people’s manners unfavorably with Phyllida’s.

And right now Phyllida was looking at Madeleine with the proper expression for this moment: thrilled by the pomp and ceremony, eager to put intelligent questions to any of Madeleine’s professors she happened to meet, or to trade pleasantries with fellow parents of graduating seniors.

In short, she was available to everyone and everything and in step with the social and academic pageantry, all of which exacerbated Madeleine’s feeling of being out of step, for this day and the rest of her life.

She plunged on, however, across Waterman Street, and up the steps of Carr House, seeking refuge and coffee.

The café had just opened. The guy behind the counter, who was wearing Elvis Costello glasses, was rinsing out the espresso machine.

At a table against the wall, a girl with stiff pink hair was smoking a clove cigarette and reading Invisible Cities. “Tainted Love” played from the stereo on top of the refrigerator.

Phyllida, holding her handbag protectively against her chest, had paused to peruse the student art on the walls: six paintings of small, skin-diseased dogs wearing bleach-bottle collars.

“Isn’t this fun?” she said tolerantly.

“La Bohème,” Alton said.

Madeleine installed her parents at a table near the bay window, as far away from the pink-haired girl as possible, and went up to the counter. The guy took his time coming over. She ordered three coffees—a large for her—and bagels. While the bagels were being toasted, she brought the coffees over to her parents.

Alton, who couldn’t sit at the breakfast table without reading, had taken a discarded Village Voice from a nearby table and was perusing it. Phyllida was staring overtly at the girl with pink hair.

“Do you think that’s comfortable?” she inquired in a low voice.

Madeleine turned to see that the girl’s ragged black jeans were held together by a few hundred safety pins.

“I don’t know, Mummy. Why don’t you go ask her?”

“I’m afraid of getting poked.”

“According to this article,” Alton said, reading the Voice, “homosexuality didn’t exist until the nineteenth century. It was invented. In Germany.”

The coffee was hot, and lifesavingly good. Sipping it, Madeleine began to feel slightly less awful.

After a few minutes, she went up to get the bagels.

They were a little burned, but she didn’t want to wait for new ones, and so brought them back to the table. After examining his with a sour expression, Alton began scraping it punitively with a plastic knife.

Phyllida asked, “So, are we going to meet Leonard today?”

“I’m not sure,” Madeleine said.

“Anything you want us to know about?”

“No.”

“Are you two still planning to live together this summer?”

By this time Madeleine had taken a bite of her bagel. And since the answer to her mother’s question was complicated—strictly speaking, Madeleine and Leonard weren’t planning on living together, because they’d broken up three weeks ago; despite this fact, however, Madeleine hadn’t given up hope of a reconciliation, and seeing as she’d spent so much effort getting her parents used to the idea of her living with a guy, and didn’t want to jeopardize that by admitting that the plan was off—she was relieved to be able to point at her full mouth, which prevented her from replying.

“Well, you’re an adult now,” Phyllida said. “You can do what you like. Though, for the record, I have to say that I don’t approve.”

“You’ve already gone on record about that,” Alton broke in.

“Because it’s still a bad idea!” Phyllida cried. “I don’t mean the propriety of it. I’m talking about the practical problems.

If you move in with Leonard—or any young man—and he’s the one with the job, then you begin at a disadvantage.

What happens if you two don’t get along? Where are you then? You won’t have any place to live. Or anything to do.”

That her mother was correct in her analysis, that the predicament Phyllida warned Madeleine about was exactly the predicament she was already in, didn’t motivate Madeleine to register agreement.

“You quit your job when you met me,” Alton said to Phyllida.

“That’s why I know what I’m talking about.”

“Can we change the subject?” Madeleine said at last, having swallowed her food.

“Of course we can, sweetheart. That’s the last I’ll say about it. If your plans change, you can always come home. Your father and I would love to have you.”

“Not me,” Alton said. “I don’t want her. Moving back home is always a bad idea. Stay away.”

“Don’t worry,” Madeleine said. “I will.”

“The choice is yours,” Phyllida said. “But if you do come home, you could have the loft. That way you can come and go as you like.”

To her surprise, Madeleine found herself contemplating this proposal.

Why not tell her parents everything, curl up in the backseat of the car, and let them take her home? She could move into her old bedroom, with the sleigh bed and the Madeline wallpaper.

She could become a spinster, like Emily Dickinson, writing poems full of dashes and brilliance, and never gaining weight.

Phyllida brought her out of this reverie.

“Maddy?” she said. “Isn’t that your friend Mitchell?”

Madeleine wheeled in her seat. “Where?”

“I think that’s Mitchell. Across the street.”

In the churchyard, sitting Indian-style in the freshly mown grass, Madeleine’s “friend” Mitchell Grammaticus was indeed there. His lips were moving, as if he was talking to himself.

“Why don’t you invite him to join us?” Phyllida said.

“Now?”

“Why not? I’d love to see Mitchell.”

“He’s probably waiting for his parents,” Madeleine said.

Phyllida waved, despite the fact that Mitchell was too far away to notice.

“What’s he doing sitting on the ground?” Alton asked.

The three Hannas stared across the street at Mitchell in his half-lotus.

“Well, if you’re not going to ask him, I will,” Phyllida finally said.

“O.K.,” Madeleine said. “Fine. I’ll go ask him.”

The day was getting warmer, but not by much. Black clouds were massing in the distance as Madeleine came down the steps of Carr House and crossed the street into the churchyard.

Someone inside the church was testing the loudspeakers, fussily repeating, “Sussex, Essex, and Kent. Sussex, Essex, and Kent.” A banner draped over the church entrance read “Class of 1982.” Beneath the banner, in the grass, was Mitchell.

His lips were still moving silently, but when he noticed Madeleine approaching they abruptly stopped.

Madeleine remained a few feet away.

“My parents are here,” she informed him.

“It’s graduation,” Mitchell replied evenly. “Everyone’s parents are here.”

“They want to say hello to you.”

At this Mitchell smiled faintly. “They probably don’t realize you’re not speaking to me.”

“No, they don’t,” Madeleine said. “And, anyway, I am. Now. Speaking to you.”

“Under duress or as a change of policy?”

Madeleine shifted her weight, wrinkling her face unhappily. “Look. I’m really hungover. I barely slept last night. My parents have been here about ten minutes and they’re already driving me crazy. So if you could just come over and say hello, that would be great.”

Mitchell’s large emotional eyes blinked twice. He was wearing a vintage gabardine shirt, dark wool pants, and beat-up wingtips. Madeleine had never seen him in shorts or tennis shoes.

“I’m sorry,” he said. “About what happened.”

“Fine,” Madeleine said, looking away. “It doesn’t matter.”

“I was just being my usual vile self.”

“So was I.”

They were quiet a moment. Madeleine felt Mitchell’s eyes on her, and she crossed her arms over her chest.

What had happened was this: one night the previous December, in a state of anxiety about her romantic life, Madeleine had run into Mitchell on campus and brought him back to her apartment.

She’d needed male attention and had flirted with him, without entirely admitting it to herself. In her bedroom, Mitchell had picked up a jar of deep-heating gel on her desk, asking what it was for.

Madeleine had explained that people who were athletic sometimes got sore muscles. She understood that Mitchell might not have experienced this phenomenon, seeing as all he did was sit in the library, but he should take her word for it.

At that point, Mitchell had come up behind her and wiped a gob of heating gel behind her ear. Madeleine jumped up, shouting at Mitchell, and wiped the gunk off with a T-shirt. Though she was within her rights to be angry,

Madeleine also knew (even at the time) that she was using the incident as a pretext for getting Mitchell out of her bedroom and for covering up the fact that she’d been flirting with him in the first place.

The worst part of the incident was how stricken Mitchell had looked, as if he’d been about to cry. He kept saying he was sorry, he was just joking around, but she ordered him to leave.

In the following days, replaying the incident in her mind, Madeleine had felt worse and worse about it. She’d been on the verge of calling Mitchell to apologize when she’d received a letter from him, a highly detailed, cogently argued, psychologically astute, quietly hostile four-page letter, in which he called her a “cocktease” and claimed that her behavior that night had been “the erotic equivalent of bread and circus, with just the circus.”

The next time they’d run into each other, Madeleine had acted as if she didn’t know him, and they hadn’t spoken since.

Now, in the churchyard of First Baptist, Mitchell looked up at her and said, “O.K. Let’s go say hello to your parents.”

Phyllida was waving as they came up the steps. In the flirtatious voice she reserved for her favorite of Madeleine’s friends, she called out, “I thought that was you on the ground. You looked like a swami!”

“Congratulations, Mitchell!” Alton said, heartily shaking Mitchell’s hand. “Big day today. One of the milestones. A new generation takes the reins.”

They invited Mitchell to sit down and asked him if he wanted anything to eat. Madeleine went back to the counter to get more coffee, glad to have Mitchell keeping her parents occupied. As she watched him, in his old man’s clothes, engaging Alton and Phyllida in conversation, Madeleine thought to herself, as she’d thought many times before, that Mitchell was the kind of smart, sane, parent-pleasing boy she should fall in love with and marry. That she would never fall in love with Mitchell and marry him, precisely because of this eligibility, was yet another indication, in a morning teeming with them, of just how screwed up she was in matters of the heart.

When she returned to the table, no one acknowledged her.

“So, Mitchell,” Phyllida was asking, “what are your plans after graduation?”

“My father’s been asking me the same question,” Mitchell answered. “For some reason he thinks Religious Studies isn’t a marketable degree.”

Madeleine smiled for the first time all day. “See? Mitchell doesn’t have a job lined up, either.”

“Well, I sort of do,” Mitchell said.

“You do not,” Madeleine challenged him.

“I’m serious. I do.” He explained that he and his roommate, Larry Pleshette, had come up with a plan to fight the recession. As liberal-arts degree holders matriculating into the job market at a time when unemployment was at 9.5 percent, they had decided, after much consideration, to leave the country and stay away as long as possible.

At the end of the summer, after they’d saved up enough money, they were going to backpack through Europe. After they’d seen everything in Europe there was to see, they were going to fly to India and stay there as long as their money held out. The whole trip would take eight or nine months, maybe as long as a year.

“You’re going to India?” Madeleine said. “That’s not a job.”

“We’re going to be research assistants,” Mitchell said. “For Prof. Hughes.”

“Prof. Hughes in the theater department?”

“I saw a program about India recently,” Phyllida said. “It was terribly depressing. The poverty!”

“That’s a plus for me, Mrs. Hanna,” Mitchell said. “I thrive in squalor.”

Phyllida, who couldn’t resist this sort of mischief, gave up her solemnity, rippling with amusement. “Then you’re going to the right place!”

“Maybe I’ll take a trip, too,” Madeleine said in a threatening tone.

No one reacted. Instead Alton asked Mitchell, “What sort of immunizations do you need for India?”

“Cholera and typhus. Gamma globulin’s optional.”

Phyllida shook her head. “Your mother must be worried sick.”

“When I was in the service,” Alton said, “they shot us up with a million things. Didn’t even tell us what the shots were for.”

“I think I’ll move to Paris,” Madeleine said in a louder voice. “Instead of getting a job.”

“Mitchell,” Phyllida continued, “with your interest in religious studies, I’d think India would be a perfect fit. They’ve got everything. Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Zoroastrians, Jains, Buddhists.

It’s like Baskin and Robbins! I’ve always been fascinated by religion. Unlike my doubting-Thomas husband.”

Alton winked. “I doubt that doubting Thomas existed.”

“Do you know Paul Moore, Bishop Moore, at the Cathedral of Saint John the Divine?”

Phyllida said, keeping Mitchell’s attention.

“He’s a great friend. You might find it interesting to meet him. We’d be happy to introduce you. When we’re in the city, I always go to services at the cathedral. Have you ever been there? Oh. Well. How can I describe it? It’s simply—well, simply divine!”

Phyllida held a hand to her throat with the pleasure of this bon mot, while Mitchell obligingly, even convincingly, laughed.

“Speaking of religious dignitaries,”

Alton cut in, “did I ever tell you about the time we met the Dalai Lama?

It was at this fund-raiser at the Waldorf. We were in the receiving line. Must have been three hundred people at least. Anyway, when we finally got up to the Dalai Lama, I asked him,

‘Are you any relation to Dolly Parton?’”

“I was mortified!” Phyllida cried. “Absolutely mortified.”

“Daddy,” Madeleine said, “you’re going to be late.”

“What?”

“You should get going if you want to get a good spot.”

Alton looked at his watch. “We’ve still got an hour.”

“It gets really crowded,” Madeleine emphasized. “You should go now.”

Alton and Phyllida looked at Mitchell, as if they trusted him to advise them. Under the table, Madeleine kicked him, and he alertly responded, “It does get pretty crowded.”

“Where’s the best place to stand?” Alton asked, again addressing Mitchell.

“By the Van Wickle Gates. At the top of College Street. That’s where we’ll come through.”

Alton stood up from the table. After shaking Mitchell’s hand, he bent to kiss Madeleine on the cheek.

“We’ll see you later. Miss Baccalaureate, 1982.”

“Congratulations, Mitchell,” Phyllida said. “So nice to see you.

And remember, when you’re on your Grand Tour, be sure to send your mother loads of letters. Otherwise, she’ll be frantic.”

To Madeleine, she said, “You might change that dress before the march. It has a visible stain.”

With that, Alton and Phyllida, in their glaring parental actuality, all seersucker and handbag, cuff links and pearls, crossed the beige-and-brick space of Carr House and went out the door.

As though to signal their departure, a new song came on: Joe Jackson’s high-pitched voice swooping above a synthesized drumbeat. The guy behind the counter cranked up the volume.

Madeleine laid her head on the table, her hair covering her face.

“I’m never drinking again,” she said.

“Famous last words.”

“You have no idea what’s been going on with me.”

“How could I? You haven’t been speaking to me.”

Without lifting her cheek from the table, Madeleine said in a pitiful voice, “I’m homeless. I’m graduating from college and I’m a homeless person.”

“Yeah, sure.”

“I am!” Madeleine insisted. “First I was supposed to move to New York with Abby and Olivia. Then it looked like I was moving to the Cape, though, so I told them to get another roommate. And now I’m not moving to the Cape and I have nowhere to go. My mother wants me to move back home but I’d rather kill myself.”

“I’m moving back home for the summer,”

Mitchell said. “To Detroit. At least you’re near New York.”

“I haven’t heard back from grad school yet and it’s June,” Madeleine continued.

“I was supposed to find out over a month ago! I could call the admissions department, but I don’t because I’m scared to find out that I’ve been rejected. As long as I don’t know, I still have hope.”

There was a moment before Mitchell spoke again. “You can come to India with me,” he said.

Madeleine opened one eye to see, through a whorl in her hair, that Mitchell wasn’t entirely joking.

“It’s not even about grad school,” she said. Taking a deep breath, she confessed, “Leonard and I broke up.”

It felt deeply pleasurable to say this, to name her sadness, and so Madeleine was surprised by the coldness of Mitchell’s reply.

“Why are you telling me this?” he said.

She lifted her head, brushing her hair out of her face. “I don’t know. You wanted to know what was the matter.”

“I didn’t, actually. I didn’t even ask.”

“I thought you might care,” Madeleine said. “Since you’re my friend.”

“Right,” Mitchell said, his voice suddenly sarcastic.

“Our wonderful friendship! Our ‘friendship’ isn’t a real friendship because it only works on your terms.

You set the rules, Madeleine. If you decide you don’t want to talk to me for three months, we don’t talk. Then you decide you do want to talk to me because you need me to entertain your parents—and now we’re talking again. We’re friends when you want to be friends, and we’re never more than friends because you don’t want to be. And I have to go along with that.”

“I’m sorry,” Madeleine said, feeling put-upon and blindsided. “I just don’t like you that way.”

“Exactly!” Mitchell cried. “You’re not attracted to me physically. O.K., fine. But who says I was ever attracted to you mentally?”

Madeleine reacted as if she’d been slapped. She was outraged, hurt, and defiant all at once.

“You’re such a”—she tried to think of the worst thing to say—“you’re such a jerk!”

She was hoping to remain imperious, but her chest was stinging, and, to her dismay, she burst into tears.

Mitchell reached out to touch her arm, but Madeleine shook him off. Getting to her feet, trying not to look like someone angrily weeping, she went out the door and down the steps onto Waterman Street.

Confronted by the festive churchyard, she turned downhill toward the river. She wanted to get away from campus. Her headache had returned, her temples were throbbing, and as she looked up at the storm clouds massing over downtown like more bad things to come, she asked herself why everyone was being so mean to her.



Madeleine’s love troubles had begun at a time when the French theory she was reading deconstructed the very notion of love. Semiotics 211 was an upper-level seminar taught by a former English department renegade.

Michael Zipperstein had come to Brown thirty-two years earlier as a New Critic. He’d inculcated the habits of close reading and biography-free interpretation into three generations of students before taking a Road to Damascus sabbatical, in Paris, in 1975, where he’d met Roland Barthes at a dinner party and been converted, over cassoulet, to the new faith.

Now Zipperstein taught two courses in the newly created Program in Semiotics Studies: Introduction to Semiotic Theory in the fall and, in the spring, Semiotics 211. Hygienically bald, with a seaman’s mustacheless white beard, Zipperstein favored French fisherman’s sweaters and wide-wale corduroys. He buried people with his reading lists: in addition to all the semiotic big hitters—Derrida, Eco, Barthes—the students in Semiotics 211 had to contend with a magpie nest of reserve reading that included everything from Balzac’s Sarrasine to issues of Semiotext(e) to photocopied selections from E. M. Cioran, Robert Walser, Claude Levi-Strauss, Peter Handke, and Carl Van Vechten.

To get into the seminar, you had to submit to a one-on-one interview with Zipperstein during which he asked bland personal questions, such as what your favorite food or dog breed was, and made enigmatic Warholian remarks in response. This esoteric probing, along with Zipperstein’s guru’s dome and beard, gave his students a sense that they’d been spiritually vetted and were now—for two hours on Thursday afternoons, at least—part of a campus lit-crit elite.

Which was exactly what Madeleine wanted. She’d become an English major for the purest and dullest of reasons: because she loved to read.

The university’s “British and American Literature Course Catalog” was, for Madeleine, what its Bergdorf equivalent was for her roommates.

A course listing like “English 274: Lyly’s Euphues” excited Madeleine the way a pair of Fiorucci cowboy boots did Abby. “English 450A:

Hawthorne and James” filled Madeleine with an expectation of sinful hours in bed not unlike what Olivia got from wearing a Lycra skirt and leather blazer to Danceteria. Even as a girl in their house in Prettybrook, Madeleine wandered into the library, with its shelves of books rising higher than she could reach—newly purchased volumes such as Love Story or Myra Breckinridgethat exuded a faintly forbidden air, as well as venerable leather-bound editions of Fielding,

Thackeray, and Dickens—and the magisterial presence of all those potentially readable words stopped her in her tracks. She could scan book spines for as long as an hour. Her cataloging of the family’s holdings rivaled the Dewey decimal system in its comprehensiveness.

Madeleine knew right where everything was. The shelves near the fireplace held Alton’s favorites, biographies of American presidents and British prime ministers, memoirs by warmongering secretaries of state, novels about sailing or espionage by William F. Buckley, Jr. Phyllida’s books filled the left side of the bookcases leading up to the parlor, NYRB-reviewed novels and essay collections, as well as coffee-table volumes about English gardens or chinoiserie.

Even now, at bed-and-breakfasts or seaside hotels, a shelf full of forlorn books always cried out to Madeleine. She ran her fingers over their salt-spotted covers. She peeled apart pages made tacky by ocean air. She had no sympathy for paperback thrillers and detective stories.

It was the abandoned hardback, the jacketless 1931 Dial Press edition ringed with many a coffee cup, that pierced Madeleine’s heart. Her friends might be calling her name on the beach, the clambake already under way, but Madeleine would sit down on the bed and read for a little while to make the sad old book feel better. She had read Longfellow’s “Hiawatha” that way. She’d read James Fenimore Cooper. She’d read H. M. Pulham, Esquire by John P. Marquand.

And yet sometimes she worried about what those musty old books were doing to her. Some people majored in English to prepare for law school. Others became journalists. The smartest guy in the honors program, Adam Vogel, a child of academics, was planning on getting a Ph.D. and becoming an academic himself.

That left a large contingent of people majoring in English by default. Because they weren’t left-brained enough for science, because history was too dry, philosophy too difficult, geology too petroleum-oriented, and math too mathematical—because they weren’t musical, artistic, financially motivated, or really all that smart, these people were pursuing university degrees doing something no different from what they’d done in first grade: reading stories.

English was what people who didn’t know what to major in majored in.

Her junior year, Madeleine had taken an honors seminar called The Marriage Plot: Selected Novels of Austen, Eliot, and James.

The class was taught by K. McCall Saunders. Saunders was a seventy-nine-year-old New Englander. He had a long, horsey face and a moist laugh that exposed his gaudy dental work. His pedagogical method consisted of his reading aloud lectures he’d written twenty or thirty years earlier.

Madeleine stayed in the class because she felt sorry for Professor Saunders and because the reading list was so good. In Saunders’s opinion, the novel had reached its apogee with the marriage plot and had never recovered from its disappearance. In the days when success in life had depended on marriage, and marriage had depended on money, novelists had had a subject to write about. The great epics sang of war, the novel of marriage.

Sexual equality, good for women, had been bad for the novel. And divorce had undone it completely.

What would it matter whom Emma married if she could file for separation later?

How would Isabel Archer’s marriage to Gilbert Osmond have been affected by the existence of a prenup?

As far as Saunders was concerned, marriage didn’t mean much anymore, and neither did the novel. Where could you find the marriage plot nowadays? You couldn’t. You had to read historical fiction. You had to read non-Western novels involving traditional societies. Afghani novels, Indian novels. You had to go, literarily speaking, back in time.

Madeleine’s final paper for the seminar was titled “The Interrogative Mood: Marriage Proposals and the (Strictly Limited) Sphere of the Feminine.”

It had impressed Saunders so much that he’d asked Madeleine to come see him. In his office, which had a grandparental smell, he expressed his opinion that Madeleine might expand her paper into a senior honors thesis, along with his willingness to serve as her advisor.

Madeleine smiled politely. Professor Saunders specialized in the periods she was interested in, the Regency leading into the Victorian era. He was sweet, and learned, and it was clear from his unsubscribed office hours that no one else wanted him as an advisor, and so Madeleine had said yes, she would love to work with him on her senior thesis.

She used a line from Trollope’s Barchester Towers as an epigraph:

“There is no happiness in love, except at the end of an English novel.”

Her plan was to begin with Jane Austen. After a brief examination of Pride and Prejudice, Persuasion, and Sense and Sensibility, all comedies, essentially, that ended with weddings, Madeleine was going to move on to the Victorian novel, where things got more complicated and considerably darker. Middlemarch and The Portrait of a Lady didn’t end with weddings.

They began with the traditional moves of the marriage plot—the suitors, the proposals, the misunderstandings—but after the wedding ceremony they kept on going. These novels followed their spirited, intelligent heroines, Dorothea Brooke and Isabel Archer, into their disappointing married lives, and it was here that the marriage plot reached its greatest artistic expression.

By 1900 the marriage plot was no more. Madeleine planned to end with a brief discussion of its demise.

In Sister Carrie, Dreiser had Carrie live adulterously with Drouet, marry Hurstwood in an invalid ceremony, and then run off to become an actress—and this was only in 1900! For a conclusion, Madeleine thought she might cite the wife-swapping in Updike.

That was the last vestige of the marriage plot: the persistence in calling it “wife-swapping” instead of “husband-swapping.” As if the woman were still a piece of property to be passed around.

Professor Saunders suggested that Madeleine look at historical sources. She’d obediently boned up on the rise of industrialism and the nuclear family, the formation of the middle class, and the Matrimonial Causes Act of 1857. But it wasn’t long before she’d become bored with the thesis. Doubts about the originality of her work nagged at her.

She felt as if she was regurgitating the arguments Saunders had made in his marriage plot seminar. Her meetings with the old professor were dispiriting, consisting of Saunders shuffling the pages she’d given him, pointing out various red marks he’d made in the margins.

Then one Sunday morning, before winter break, Abby’s boyfriend, Whitney, materialized at their kitchen table, reading something called Of Grammatology.

When Madeleine asked what the book was about, she was given to understand by Whitney that the idea of a book being “about” something was exactly what this book was against, and that, if it was “about” anything, then it was about the need to stop thinking of books as being about things.

Madeleine said she was going to make coffee. Whitney asked if she would make him some, too.

College wasn’t like the real world. In the real world people dropped names based on their renown.

In college, people dropped names based on their obscurity. Thus, in the weeks after this exchange with Whitney, Madeleine began hearing people saying “Derrida.” She heard them saying “Lyotard” and “Foucault” and “Deleuze” and “Baudrillard.”

That most of these people were those she instinctually disapproved of—upper-middle-class kids who wore Doc Martens and anarchist symbols—made Madeleine dubious about the value of their enthusiasm. But soon she noticed David Koppel, a smart and talented poet, also reading Derrida.

And Pookie Ames, who read slush for The Paris Review and whom Madeleine liked, was taking a course with Professor Zipperstein.

Madeleine had always been partial to grandiose professors, people like Sears Jayne who hammed it up in the classroom, reciting Hart Crane or

Anne Sexton in a gag voice. Whitney acted as though Professor Jayne was a joke. Madeleine didn’t agree. But after three solid years of taking literature courses, Madeleine had nothing like a firm critical methodology to apply to what she read.

Instead she had a fuzzy, unsystematic way of talking about books. It embarrassed her to hear the things people said in class. And the things she said. I felt that. It was interesting the way Proust. I liked the way Faulkner.

And when Olivia, who was tall and slim, with a long, aristocratic nose like a saluki, came in one day carrying Of Grammatology, Madeleine knew that what had been marginal was now mainstream.

“What’s that book like?”

“You haven’t read it?”

“Would I be asking if I had?”

Olivia sniffed. “Aren’t we a little bitchy today?”

“Sorry.”

“Just kidding. It’s great. Derrida is my absolute god!”

Almost overnight it became laughable to read writers like Cheever or Updike, who wrote about the suburbia Madeleine and most of her friends had grown up in, in favor of reading the Marquis de Sade, who wrote about anally deflowering virgins in eighteenth-century France.

The reason de Sade was preferable was that his shocking sex scenes weren’t about sex but politics. They were therefore anti-imperialist, anti-bourgeois, anti-patriarchal, and anti-everything a smart young feminist should be against. Right up through her third year at college, Madeleine kept wholesomely taking courses like Victorian Fantasy: From Phantastes to The Water-Babies, but by senior year she could no longer ignore the contrast between the hard-up, blinky people in her Beowulf seminar and the hipsters down the hall reading Maurice Blanchot.

Going to college in the moneymaking eighties lacked a certain radicalism. Semiotics was the first thing that smacked of revolution. It drew a line; it created an elect; it was sophisticated and Continental; it dealt with provocative subjects, with torture, sadism, hermaphroditism—with sex and power.

Madeleine had always been popular at school. Years of being popular had left her with the reflexive ability to separate the cool from the uncool, even within subgroups, like the English department, where the concept of cool didn’t appear to obtain.

If Restoration drama was getting you down, if scanning Wordsworth was making you feel dowdy and ink-stained, there was another option. You could flee K. McCall Saunders and the old New Criticism. You could defect to the new imperium of Derrida and Eco. You could sign up for Semiotics 211 and find out what everyone else was talking about.



Semiotics 211 was limited to ten students. Of the ten, eight had taken Introduction to Semiotic Theory. This was visually apparent at the first class meeting.

Lounging around the seminar table, when Madeleine came into the room from the wintry weather outside, were eight people in black T-shirts and ripped black jeans. A few had razored off the necks or sleeves of their T-shirts. There was something creepy about one guy’s face—it was like a baby’s face that had grown whiskers—and it took Madeleine a full minute to realize that he’d shaved off his eyebrows.

Everyone in the room was so spectral-looking that Madeleine’s natural healthiness seemed suspect, like a vote for Reagan. She was relieved, therefore, when a big guy in a down jacket and snowmobile boots showed up and took the empty seat next to her. He had a cup of take-out coffee.

Zipperstein asked the students to introduce themselves and explain why they were taking the seminar.

The boy without eyebrows spoke up first. “Um, let’s see. I’m finding it hard to introduce myself, actually, because the whole idea of social introductions is so problematized.

Like, if I tell you that my name is Thurston Meems and that I grew up in Stamford, Connecticut, will you know who I am? O.K.

My name’s Thurston and I’m from Stamford, Connecticut. I’m taking this course because I read Of Grammatology last summer and it blew my mind.”

When it was the turn of the boy next to Madeleine, he said in a quiet voice that he was a double major (biology and philosophy) and had never taken a semiotics course before, that his parents had named him Leonard, that it had always seemed pretty handy to have a name, especially when you were being called to dinner, and that if anyone wanted to call him Leonard he would answer to it.

Leonard didn’t make another comment. During the rest of the class, he leaned back in his chair, stretching out his long legs. After he finished his coffee, he dug into his right snowmobile boot and, to Madeleine’s surprise, pulled out a tin of chewing tobacco. With two stained fingers, he placed a wad of tobacco in his cheek. For the next two hours, every minute or so, he spat, discreetly but audibly, into the cup.

Every week Zipperstein assigned one daunting book of theory and one literary selection. The pairings were eccentric if not downright arbitrary. (What did Saussure’s Writings in General Linguistics, for instance, have to do with Pynchon’s The Crying of Lot 49?) As for Zipperstein himself, he didn’t run the class so much as observe it from behind the one-way mirror of his opaque personality. He hardly said a word. He asked questions now and then to stimulate discussion, and often went to the window to gaze in the direction of Narragansett Bay, as if thinking about his wooden sloop in dry dock.

Three weeks into the course, on a February day of flurries and gray skies, they read Zipperstein’s own book, The Making of Signs, along with Peter Handke’s A Sorrow Beyond Dreams.

It was always embarrassing when professors assigned their own books. Even Madeleine, who found all the reading hard going, could tell that Zipperstein’s contribution to the field was reformulative and second-tier.

Everyone seemed a little hesitant when talking about The Making of Signs, so it was a relief when, after the break, they turned to the literary selection.

“So,” Zipperstein asked, blinking behind his round wire-rims. “What did you make of the Handke?”

After a short silence, Thurston spoke up. “The Handke was totally dank and depressing,” he said. “I loved it.”

Thurston was a sly-looking boy with short, gelled hair. His eyebrowlessness, along with his pale complexion, gave his face a superintelligent quality, like a floating, disembodied brain.

“Care to elaborate?” Zipperstein said.

“Well, Professor, here’s a subject dear to my heart—offing yourself.” The other students tittered as Thurston warmed to his topic.

“It’s purportedly autobiographical, this book. But I’d contend, with Barthes, that the act of writing is itself a fictionalization, even if you’re treating actual events.”

Bart. So that was how you pronounced it. Madeleine made a note, grateful to be spared humiliation.

Meanwhile Thurston was saying, “So Handke’s mother commits suicide and Handke sits down to write about it. He wants to be as objective as possible, to be totally—remorseless!”

Thurston stifled a smile. He aspired to be a person who would react to his own mother’s suicide with high-literary remorselessness, and his soft, young face lit up with pleasure. “Suicide is a trope,” he announced.

“Especially in German literature. You’ve got The Sorrows of Young Werther. You’ve got Kleist. Hey, I just thought of something.” He held up a finger.

“The Sorrows of Young Werther.” He held up another finger.

“A Sorrow Beyond Dreams. My theory is that Handke felt the weight of all that tradition and this book was his attempt to break free.”

“How do you mean ‘free’?” Zipperstein said.

“From the whole Teutonic, Sturm-und-Drang, suicidal thing.”

The flurries swirling outside the windows looked like either flakes of soap or flash of ash, like something either very clean or very dirty.

“The Sorrows of Young Werther is an apt reference,” Zipperstein said.

“But I think that’s more the translator’s doing than Handke’s. In German the book’s called Wunschloses Unglück.”

Thurston smiled, either because he was pleased to be receiving Zipperstein’s full attention or because he thought German sounded funny.

“It’s a play on a German saying, wunschlos glücklich, which means being happier than you could ever wish for. Only here Handke makes a nice reversal. It’s a serious and strangely wonderful title.”

“So it means being unhappier than you could ever wish for,” Madeleine said.

Zipperstein looked at her for the first time.

“In a sense. As I said, something is lost in translation. What was your take?”

“On the book?” Madeleine asked, and immediately realized how stupid this sounded. She fell silent, the blood beating in her ears.

People blushed in nineteenth-century English novels but never in contemporary Austrian ones.

Before the silence became uncomfortable, Leonard came to her rescue.

“I have a comment,” he said. “If I was going to write about my mother’s suicide, I don’t think I’d be too concerned about being experimental.” He leaned forward, putting his elbows on the table.

“I mean, wasn’t anybody put off by Handke’s so-called remorselessness? Didn’t this book strike anyone as a tad cold?”

“Better cold than sentimental,” Thurston said.

“Do you think? Why?”

“Because we’ve read the sentimental, filial account of a cherished dead parent before. We’ve read it a million times. It doesn’t have any power anymore.”

“I’m doing a little thought experiment here,” Leonard said.

“Say my mother killed herself. And say I wrote a book about it.

Why would I want to do something like that?” He closed his eyes and leaned his head back.

“First, I’d do it to cope with my grief. Second, maybe to paint a portrait of my mother. To keep her alive in my memory.”

“And you think your reaction is universal,” Thurston said.

“That because you’d respond to the death of a parent a certain way, that obligates Handke to do the same.”

“I’m saying that if your mother kills herself it’s not a literary trope.”

Madeleine’s heart had quieted now. She was listening to the discussion with interest.

Thurston was nodding his head in a way that somehow didn’t suggest agreement.

“Yeah, O.K.,” he said. “Handke’s real mother killed herself. She died in a real world and Handke felt real grief or whatever. But that’s not what this book’s about. Books aren’t about ‘real life.’ Books are about other books.” He raised his mouth like a wind instrument and blew out bright notes.

“My theory is that the problem Handke was trying to solve here, from a literary standpoint, was how do you write about something, even something real and painful—like suicide—when all of the writing that’s been done on that subject has robbed you of any originality of expression?”

What Thurston was saying seemed to Madeleine both insightful and horribly wrong. It was maybe true, what he said, but it shouldn’t have been.

“‘Popular literature,’” Zipperstein quipped, proposing an essay title. “‘Or, How to Beat a Dead Horse.’”

A spasm of mirth traveled through the class. Madeleine looked over to see that Leonard was staring at her. When the class ended, he gathered up his books and left.

She started seeing Leonard around after that. She saw him crossing the green one afternoon, hatless in winter drizzle. She saw him at Mutt & Geoff’s, eating a messy Buddy Cianci sandwich. She saw him, one morning, waiting for a bus on South Main. Each time, Leonard was alone, looking forlorn and uncombed like a great big motherless boy. At the same time, he appeared somehow older than most guys at school.

It was Madeleine’s last semester of senior year, a time when she was supposed to have some fun, and she wasn’t having any. She’d never thought of herself as hard up. She preferred to think of her current boyfriendless state as salutary and head-clearing. But when she found herself wondering what it would be like to kiss a guy who chewed tobacco, she began to worry that she was fooling herself.

Looking back, Madeleine realized that her college love life had fallen short of expectations. Her freshman roommate, Jennifer Boomgaard, had rushed off to Health Services the first week of school to be fitted for a diaphragm. Unaccustomed to sharing a room with anybody, much less a stranger, Madeleine felt that Jenny was a little too quick with her intimacies. She didn’t want to be shown Jennifer’s diaphragm, which reminded her of an uncooked ravioli, and she certainly didn’t want to feel the spermicidal jelly that Jenny offered to squirt into her palm. Madeleine was shocked when Jennifer started going to parties with the diaphragm already in place, when she wore it to the Harvard-Brown game, and when she left it one morning on top of their miniature fridge. That winter, when the Rev. Desmond Tutu came to campus for an anti-apartheid rally, Madeleine asked Jennifer on their way to see the great cleric, “Did you put your diaphragm in?” They lived the next four months in an eighteen-by-fifteen room without speaking to each other.

Though Madeleine hadn’t arrived at college sexually inexperienced, her freshman learning curve resembled a flat line. Aside from one make-out session with a Uruguayan named Carlos, a sandal-wearing engineering student who in low light looked like Che Guevara, the only boy she’d fooled around with was a high school senior visiting campus for Early Action weekend. She found Tim standing in line at the Ratty, pushing his cafeteria tray along the metal track, and visibly quivering. His blue blazer was too big for him. He’d spent the entire day wandering around campus with no one speaking to him. Now he was starving and wasn’t sure if he was allowed to eat in the cafeteria or not. Tim seemed to be the only person at Brown more lost than Madeleine. She helped him negotiate the Ratty and, afterward, took him on a tour of the university. Finally, around ten-thirty that night, they ended up back in Madeleine’s dorm room. Tim had the long-lashed eyes and pretty features of an expensive Bavarian doll, a little prince or yodeling shepherd boy. His blue blazer was on the floor and Madeleine’s shirt unbuttoned when Jennifer Boomgaard came through the door. “Oh,” she said, “sorry,” and proceeded to stand there, smiling at the floor as if already relishing how this juicy bit of gossip would play along the hall. When she finally did leave, Madeleine sat up and readjusted her clothes, and Tim picked up his blazer and went back to high school.

At Christmas, when Madeleine went home for vacation, she thought the scale in her parents’ bathroom was broken. She got off to recalibrate the dial and got back on, whereupon the scale again registered the same weight. Stepping in front of the mirror, Madeleine encountered a worried chipmunk staring back.

“Am I not getting asked out because I’m fat,” the chipmunk said, “or am I fat because I’m not getting asked out?”

“I never got the freshman fifteen,” her sister gloated when Madeleine came down to breakfast.

“But I didn’t pig out like all my friends did.” Accustomed to Alwyn’s teasing, Madeleine paid no attention, quietly slicing and eating the first of the fifty-seven grapefruits she subsisted on until New Year’s.

Dieting fooled you into thinking you could control your life. By January, Madeleine was down five pounds, and by the time squash season ended she was back in great shape, and still she didn’t meet anyone she liked. The boys at college seemed either incredibly immature or prematurely middle-aged, bearded like therapists, warming brandy snifters over candles while listening to Coltrane’s A Love Supreme. It wasn’t until her junior year that Madeleine had a serious boyfriend. Billy Bainbridge was the son of Dorothy Bainbridge, whose uncle owned a third of the newspapers in the United States. Billy had flushed cheeks, blond curls, and a scar on his right temple that made him even more adorable than he already was. He was soft-spoken and nice-smelling, like Ivory soap. Naked, his body was nearly hairless.

Billy didn’t like to talk about his family. Madeleine took this as a sign of good breeding. Billy was a legacy at Brown and sometimes worried that he wouldn’t have gotten in on his own. Sex with Billy was cozy, it was snuggly, it was perfectly fine. He wanted to be a filmmaker. The one film he made for Advanced Filmmaking, however, was a violent, unbroken twelve minutes of Billy throwing fecal-looking brownie mix at the camera. Madeleine began to wonder if there was a reason he never talked about his family.

One thing he did talk about, however, with increasing intensity, was circumcision. Billy had read an article in an alternative health magazine that argued against the practice, and it made a big impression on him.

“If you think about it, it’s a pretty weird thing to do to a baby,” he said. “Cut off part of its dick? What’s so different about a tribe in, like, Papua New Guinea putting bones through their noses and cutting off a baby’s foreskin? A bone through the nose is a lot less invasive.” Madeleine listened, trying to look sympathetic, and hoped Billy would drop the subject. But as the weeks passed he kept returning to it.

“The doctors just do it automatically in this country,” he said.

“They didn’t ask my parents. It’s not like I’m Jewish or anything.” He derided justifications on the basis of health or hygiene. “Maybe that made sense three thousand years ago, out in the desert, when you couldn’t take a shower. But now?”

One night, as they were lying in bed, naked, Madeleine noticed Billy examining his penis, stretching it.

“What are you doing?” she asked.

“I’m looking for the scar,” he said somberly.

He interrogated his European friends, Henrik the Intact, Olivier the Foreskinned, asking,

“But does it feel supersensitive?” Billy was convinced that he’d been deprived of sensation. Madeleine tried not to take this personally. Plus there were other problems with their relationship by then. Billy had a habit of staring deeply into Madeleine’s eyes in a way that was somehow controlling. His roommate situation was odd. He lived off campus with an attractive, muscular girl named Kyle who was sleeping with at least three people, including Fatima Shirazi, a niece of the shah of Iran. On the wall of his living room Billy had painted the words Kill the Father. Killing the father was what, in Billy’s opinion, college was all about.

“Who’s your father?” he asked Madeleine. “Is it Virginia Woolf? Is it Sontag?”

“In my case,” Madeleine said, “my father really is my father.”

“Then you have to kill him.”

“Who’s your father?”

“Godard,” he said.

Billy talked about renting a house in Guanajuato with Madeleine over the summer. He said she could write a novel while he made a film. His faith in her, in her writing (even though she hardly wrote any fiction), made Madeleine feel so good that she started going along with the idea. And then one day she came up onto Billy’s front porch and was about to rap on his window when something told her to look in the window instead. In the storm-tossed bed, Billy lay curled, John Lennon–style, against the spread-eagled Kyle. Both were naked. A second later, in a puff of smoke, Fatima materialized, also naked, shaking baby powder over her gleaming Persian skin. She smiled at her bedmates, her teeth seed-like in purple, royal gums.

Maddy’s next boyfriend wasn’t strictly her fault. She would never have met Dabney Carlisle if she hadn’t taken an acting class, and she would never have taken an acting class if it hadn’t been for her mother. As a young woman, Phyllida had wanted to be an actress. Her parents had been opposed, however.

“Acting wasn’t what people in our family, especially the ladies, did,” was the way Phyllida put it. Every so often, in reflective moods, she told her daughters the story of her one great disobedience. After graduating from college, Phyllida had “run away” to Hollywood. Without telling her parents, she’d flown out to Los Angeles, staying with a friend from Smith. She’d found a job as a secretary in an insurance company. She and the friend, a girl named Sally Peyton, moved into a bungalow in Santa Monica. In six months Phyllida had three auditions, one screen test, and “loads of invitations.” She’d once seen Jackie Gleason carrying a chihuahua into a restaurant. She’d developed a lustrous suntan she described as “Egyptian.” Whenever Phyllida spoke about this period in her life, it seemed as if she was talking about another person. As for Alton, he became quiet, fully aware that Phyllida’s loss had been his gain. It was on the train back to New York, the next Christmas, that she’d met the straight-backed lieutenant colonel, recently returned from Berlin. Phyllida never went back to L.A. She got married instead. “And had you two,” she told her daughters.

Phyllida’s inability to realize her dreams had given Madeleine her own. Her mother’s life was the great counterexample. It represented the injustice Madeleine’s life would rectify. To come of age simultaneously with a great social movement, to grow up in the age of Betty Friedan and ERA marches and Bella Abzug’s indomitable hats, to define your identity when it was being redefined, this was a freedom as great as any of the American freedoms Madeleine had read about in school. She could remember the night, in 1973, when her family gathered before the television in the den to watch the tennis match between Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs. How she, Alwyn, and Phyllida had rooted for Billie Jean, while Alton had pulled for Bobby Riggs. How, as King ran Riggs back and forth across the court, outserving him, hitting winners he was too slow to return, Alton began to grumble.

“It’s not a fair fight! Riggs is too old.

If they want a real test, she should play Smith or Newcombe.”

But it didn’t matter what Alton said.

It didn’t matter that Bobby Riggs was fifty-five and King twenty-nine, or that Riggs hadn’t been an especially great player even in his prime. What mattered was that this tennis match was on national television, during prime time, billed for weeks as “The Battle of the Sexes,” and that the woman was winning. If any single moment defined Madeleine’s generation of girls, dramatized their aspirations, put into clear focus what they expected from themselves and from life, it was those two hours and fifteen minutes when the country watched a man in white shorts get thrashed by a woman, pummeled repeatedly until all he could do, after match point, was to jump feebly over the net. And even that was telling: you were supposed to jump the net when you won, not lost. So how male was that, to act like a winner when you’d just been creamed?

At the first meeting of Acting Workshop, Professor Churchill, a bald bullfrog of a man, asked the students to say something about themselves. Half the people in the class were theater majors, serious about acting or directing. Madeleine mumbled something about loving Shakespeare and Eugene O’Neill.

Dabney Carlisle stood up and said, “I’ve done a little modeling work, down in New York. My agent suggested I should take some acting lessons. So here I am.”

The modeling he’d done consisted of a single magazine ad, showing a group of Leni Riefenstahl–ish athletes in boxer briefs, standing in a receding line on a beach whose black volcanic sand steamed around their marble feet. Madeleine didn’t see the photograph until she and Dabney were already going out, when Dabney gingerly took it out of the bartending manual where he kept it safely pressed. She was inclined to make fun of it but something reverential in Dabney’s expression stopped her. And so she asked where the beach had been (Montauk) and why it was so black (it wasn’t) and how much he’d gotten paid (“four figures”) and what the other guys were like (“total a-holes”) and if he was wearing the underpants right now. It was sometimes difficult, with boys, to take an interest in the things that interested them. But with Dabney she wished it had been curling, she longed for it to be the model UN, anything but male modeling. This, anyway, was the authentic emotion she now identified herself as having felt. At the time—Dabney cautioned her against touching the ad before he got it laminated—Madeleine had rehearsed in her mind the standard arguments: that though objectification was de facto bad, the emergence of the idealized male form in the mass media scored a point for equality; that if men started getting objectified and started worrying about their looks and their bodies, they might begin to understand the burden women had been living with since forever, and might therefore be sensitized to these issues of the body. She even went so far as to admire Dabney for his courage in allowing himself to be photographed in snug little gray underpants.

Looking the way Madeleine and Dabney did, it was inevitable that they would be cast as romantic leads in the scenes the workshop performed. Madeleine was Rosalind to Dabney’s wooden Orlando, Maggie to his brick-like Brick in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof. To rehearse the first time, they met at Dabney’s fraternity house. Merely stepping through the front door reinforced Madeleine’s aversion to places like Sigma Chi. It was around ten on a Sunday morning. The vestiges of the previous evening’s “Hawaiian Night” were still there to see—the lei hanging from the antlers of the moose head on the wall, the plastic “grass” skirt trampled on the beer-sodden floor, a skirt that, should Madeleine succumb to the outrageous good looks of Dabney Carlisle, she might, at a minimum, have to watch some drunken slut hula in to the baying of the brothers, or, at a maximum (for mai tais made you do crazy things), might even don herself, up in Dabney’s room, for his pleasure alone. On the low-slung couch two Sigma Chi members were watching TV. At Madeleine’s appearance, they stirred, rising out of the gloom like openmouthed carp. She hurried to the back stairs, thinking the things she always thought when it came to frats and frat guys: that their appeal stemmed from a primitive need for protection (one thought of Neanderthal clans banding together against other Neanderthal clans); that the hazing the pledges underwent (being stripped and blindfolded and left in the lobby of the Biltmore Hotel with bus fare taped to their genitals) enacted the very fears of male rape and emasculation that membership in the fraternity promised protection against; that any guy who longed to join a frat suffered from insecurities that poisoned his relationships with women; that there was something seriously wrong with homophobic guys who centered their lives around a homoerotic bond; that the stately mansions maintained by generations of dues-paying fraternity members were in reality sites for date rape and problem drinking; that frats always smelled bad; that you didn’t ever want to shower in one; that only freshman girls were stupid enough to go to frat parties; that Kelly Traub had slept with a Sigma Delt guy who kept saying,

“Now you see it, now you don’t, now you see it, now you don’t”; that such a thing wasn’t going to happen to her, to Madeleine, ever.

What she hadn’t expected when it came to a fraternity was a sunny-haired silent type like Dabney, learning his lines in a folding chair, in parachute pants, shoeless. Looking back on their relationship, Madeleine figured she’d had no choice. Dabney and she had been selected for each other in a Royal Wedding kind of way. She was Prince Charles to his Princess Di. She knew he couldn’t act. Dabney had the artistic soul of a third-string tight end. In life Dabney moved and said little. Onstage he moved not at all but had to say a lot. His best dramatic moments came when the strain on his face from remembering his lines resembled the emotion he was trying to simulate.

Acting opposite Dabney made Madeleine more stiff and nervous than she already was. She wanted to do scenes with the talented kids in the workshop. She suggested interesting bits from The Vietnamization of New Jersey and Mamet’s Sexual Perversity in Chicago, but got no takers. Nobody wanted to lower his or her average by acting with her.

Dabney didn’t let it bother him. “Bunch of little shits in that class,” he said. “They’ll never get any print work, much less movies.”

He was more laconic than she liked her boyfriends to be. He had the wit of a store mannequin. But Dabney’s physical perfection pushed these realities out of her mind. She’d never been in a relationship where she wasn’t the more attractive partner. It was slightly intimidating. But she could handle it. At three a.m., while Dabney lay sleeping beside her, Madeleine found she was up to the task of inventorying each abdominal cord, every hard lump of muscle. She enjoyed applying calipers to Dabney’s waist to measure his body fat. Underwear modeling was all about the abs, Dabney said, and the abs were all about sit-ups and diet. The pleasure Madeleine got from looking at Dabney was reminiscent of the pleasure she’d gotten as a girl from looking at sleek hunting dogs. Underneath this pleasure, like the coals that fed it, was a fierce need to enfold Dabney and siphon off his strength and beauty. It was all very primitive and evolutionary and felt fantastic. The problem was that she hadn’t been able to allow herself to enjoy Dabney or even to exploit him a little, but had had to go and be a total girl about it and convince herself that she was in love with him. Madeleine required emotion, apparently. She disapproved of the idea of meaningless, extremely satisfying sex.

And so she began to tell herself that Dabney’s acting was “restrained” or “economical.” She appreciated that Dabney was “secure about himself” and “didn’t need to prove anything” and wasn’t a “showoff.” Instead of worrying that he was dull, Madeleine decided he was gentle. Instead of thinking he was poorly read, she called him intuitive. She exaggerated Dabney’s mental abilities in order not to feel shallow for wanting his body. To this end she helped Dabney write—O.K., she wrote—English and anthro papers for him and, when he got A’s, felt confirmed of his intelligence. She sent him off to modeling auditions in New York with good-luck kisses and listened to him complain bitterly about the “faggots” who hadn’t hired his services. It turned out that Dabney wasn’t so beautiful. Among the truly beautiful he was only so-so. He couldn’t even smile right.

At the end of the semester, the acting students met separately with the professor for a critical review. Churchill welcomed Madeleine with a wolfish yellow grin, then sat back jowly and deliberate in his chair.

“I’ve enjoyed having you in the class, Madeleine,” he said. “But you can’t act.”

“Don’t hold back,” Madeleine said, chastened but laughing. “Give it to me straight.”

“You have a good feel for language, for Shakespeare especially. But your voice is reedy and you look worried onstage. Your forehead has a perpetual crease. A vocal coach could go a long way toward helping your instrument. But I worry about your worrying. You’ve got it right now. The crease.”

“It’s called thinking.”

“Which is fine.

If you’re playing Eleanor Roosevelt. Or Golda Meir. But those parts don’t come around very often.”

Churchill, steepling his fingers, continued, “I’d be more diplomatic if I thought this meant a lot to you. But I get the feeling you don’t want to be a professional actress, do you?”

“No,” Madeleine said.

“Good. You’re lovely. You’re bright. The world is your oyster. Go with my blessings.”

When Dabney returned from his review with Churchill, he looked even more self-contented than usual.

“So?” Madeleine asked. “How did it go?”

“He says I’m perfect for soaps.”

“Soap commercials?”

Dabney looked peeved. “Days of Our Lives. General Hospital. Ever heard of those?”

“Did he mean that as a compliment?”

“How else could he mean it? Soap actors have it made! They work every day, make great money, and never have to travel. I’ve been wasting my time trying to get all this advertising work. Screw that. I’m going to tell my agent to start lining up some auditions for soaps.”

Madeleine was silent at this news. She’d assumed Dabney’s enthusiasm for modeling was temporary, a tuition-earning scheme. Now she realized he was in earnest. She was, in fact, dating a model.

“What are you thinking?” Dabney asked her.

“Nothing.”

“Tell me.”

“Just that—I don’t know—but I doubt Prof. Churchill has that high of an opinion of the acting on Days of Our Lives.”

“What did he tell us the first class? He said he was giving a workshop in acting. For people who wanted to work in the theater.”

“In the theater doesn’t mean …”

“What did he tellyou? Did he say you were going to be a movie star?”

“He told me I couldn’t act,” Madeleine said.

“He did, huh?” Dabney put his hands in his pockets, leaning back on his heels as if relieved not to have to deliver this verdict himself. “Is that why you’re so pissed off? And have to tear down my crit?”

“I’m not tearing down your crit. I’m just not sure you got Churchill’s meaning, exactly.”

Dabney let out a bitter laugh. “I wouldn’t get it right, would I? I’m too dumb. I’m just some dumb jock you have to write English papers for.”

“I don’t know. You seem to have a pretty good grasp of sarcasm.”

“Man, am I ever lucky,” Dabney said.

“What would I do if you weren’t around?

You have to catch all the subtleties for me, don’t you? You and your flair for catching subtleties. It must be nice to be rich and sit around all day catching subtleties.

What do you know about needing to make a living?

It’s fine for you to make fun of my ad. You didn’t get into college on a football scholarship. And now you have to come in here and run me down.

You know what? This is bullshit. This is total bullshit. I’m sick of your condescension and your superiority complex. And Churchill’s right. You can’t act.”

In the end Madeleine had to admit that Dabney was far more fluent than she’d ever expected. He was capable of portraying a range of emotions, too, anger, disgust, wounded pride, and of simulating others, including affection, passion, and love. He had a great career in the soaps ahead of him.



Madeleine and Dabney had broken up in May, right before summer, and there was no better time than summer to forget about somebody. She’d gone straight down to Prettybrook the day she finished her last exam. For once she was glad to have such sociable parents. With all the cocktail parties and convivial dinners on Wilson Lane there was little time to dwell on herself. In July, she got an internship at a nonprofit poetry organization on the Upper East Side and began riding the train into the city. Madeleine’s job was to oversee submissions for the annual New Voices award, which involved making sure that the submissions were complete before sending them off to the judge (Howard Nemerov, that year). Madeleine wasn’t particularly technical, but because everyone else in the office was even less so, she ended up being the go-to person whenever the copier or the dot-matrix printer malfunctioned. Her coworker Brenda would come up to Madeleine’s desk at least once a week and ask in a babyish voice,

“Can you help me? The printer’s not being nice.” The only part of the day Madeleine enjoyed was her lunch hour, when she got to walk around the muggy, stinking, thrilling streets, eat quiche in a French bistro as narrow as a bowling alley, and stare at the styles women her age or a little older were wearing. When the one straight guy at the nonprofit asked her to have a drink after work,

Madeleine cooly answered, “Sorry, I can’t,” trying not to feel bad about hurting his feelings, trying to think about her own feelings for a change.

She arrived back at college for her senior year, then, intent on being studious, career-oriented, and aggressively celibate. Casting a wide net, Madeleine sent away for applications to Yale grad school (English Language and Literature), an organization for teaching English in China, and an advertising internship at Foote, Cone & Belding, in Chicago. She studied for the GRE using a sample booklet. The verbal section was easy. The math required brushing up on her high school algebra. The logic problems, however, were a defeat to the spirit. “At the annual dancers’ ball a number of dancers performed their favorite dance with their favorite partners. Alan danced the tango, while Becky watched the waltz. James and Charlotte were fantastic together. Keith was magnificent during his foxtrot and Simon excelled at the rumba. Jessica danced with Alan. But Laura did not dance with Simon. Can you determine who danced with whom and which dance they each enjoyed?” Logic wasn’t something Madeleine had been expressly taught. It seemed unfair to be asked about it. She did as the book suggested, diagramming the problems, placing Alan, Becky, James, Charlotte, Keith, Simon, Jessica, and Laura on the dance floor of her scrap paper, and pairing them according to the instructions. But their complicated transit wasn’t a subject Madeleine’s mind naturally followed. She wanted to know why James and Charlotte were fantastic together, and if Jessica and Alan were going out, and why Laura wouldn’t dance with Simon, and if Becky was upset, watching.

One afternoon, on the bulletin board outside Hillel House, Madeleine noticed a flyer announcing the Melvin and Hetty Greenberg Fellowship for summer study at Hebrew University in Jerusalem, and she applied for that. Using contacts of Alton’s in the publishing world, she put on a business suit and went down to New York for an informational interview with an editor at Simon and Schuster. The editor, Terry Wirth, had once been a bright, idealistic English major just like Madeleine, but she found him that afternoon, in his tiny, manuscript-piled office looking onto the gloomy canyon of Sixth Avenue, a middle-aged father of two with a salary far below the median of his former classmates and a nasty, hour-and-fifteen-minute commute to his split-level in Montclair, New Jersey. On the prospects of a book he was publishing that month, the memoir of a migrant farmer,

Wirth said, “Now’s the calm before the calm.” He gave Madeleine a stack of manuscripts from the slush pile to critique, offering to pay her fifty bucks a pop.

Instead of reading the manuscripts, Madeleine took the subway down to the East Village. After buying a bag of pignoli cookies at De Robertis, she plunged into a hair salon, where, on a whim, she allowed a butch woman with a short, rat-tailed haircut to go to work on her.

“Cut it close on the sides, higher on top,” Madeleine said.

“You sure?” the woman said.

“I’m sure,” Madeleine answered. To show her resolve, she took off her glasses. Forty-five minutes later, she put her glasses back on, horror-struck and elated at the transformation. Her head was really quite enormous. She had never fathomed its true size. She looked like Annie Lennox, or David Bowie. Like someone the hairdresser might be dating.

The Annie Lennox look was O.K., however. Androgyny was just the thing. Once she was back at school, Madeleine’s haircut proclaimed her serious frame of mind, and by the end of the year, when her bangs had grown out to a maddening length she didn’t know what to do with, she remained firm in her renunciations. (Her only slip-up had been the night in her bedroom with Mitchell, but nothing had happened.) Madeleine had her thesis to write. She had her future to figure out. The last thing she needed was a boy to distract her from her work and disturb her equilibrium. But then, during spring semester, she met Leonard Bankhead and her resolve went out the window.

He shaved irregularly. His Skoal had a menthol scent, cleaner, more pleasant than Madeleine expected. Whenever she looked up to find Leonard staring at her with his St. Bernard’s eyes (the eyes of a drooler, maybe, but also of a loyal brute who could dig you out of an avalanche), Madeleine couldn’t help staring back a significant moment longer.

One evening in early March, when she went to the Rockefeller Library to pick up the reserve reading for Semiotics 211, she found Leonard there as well. He was leaning against the counter, speaking animatedly to the girl on duty, who was unfortunately rather cute in a busty Bettie Page way.

“Think about it, though,” Leonard was saying to the girl. “Think about it from the point of view of the fly.”

“O.K., I’m a fly,” the girl said with a throaty laugh.

“We move in slow motion to them. They can see the swatter coming from a million miles away. The flies are like, ‘Wake me when the swatter gets close.’”

Noticing Madeleine, the girl told Leonard, “Just a sec.”

Madeleine held out her call order slip, and the girl took it and went off into the stacks.

“Picking up the Balzac?” Leonard said.

“Yes.”

“Balzac to the rescue.”

Normally, Madeleine would have had many things to say to this, many comments about Balzac to make. But her mind was a blank. She didn’t even remember to smile until he’d looked away.

Bettie Page came back with Madeleine’s order, sliding it toward her and immediately turning back to Leonard. He seemed different than he did in class, more exuberant, supercharged. He raised his eyebrows in a crazed, Jack Nicholson way and said,

“My house fly theory is related to my theory about why time seems to go faster as you get older.”

“Why’s that?” the girl asked.

“It’s proportional,” Leonard explained. “When you’re five, you’ve only been alive a couple thousand days. But by the time you’re fifty, you’ve lived around twenty thousand days. So a day when you’re five seems longer because it’s a greater percentage of the whole.”

“Yeah, sure,” the girl teased, “that follows.”

But Madeleine had understood. “That makes sense,” she said. “I always wondered why that was.”

“It’s just a theory,” Leonard said.

Bettie Page tapped Leonard’s hand to get his attention.

“Flies aren’t always so fast,” she said.

“I’ve caught flies in my bare hands before.”

“Especially in winter,” Leonard said.

“That’s probably the kind of fly I’d be. One of those knucklehead winter flies.”

There was no good excuse for Madeleine to hang around the reserve reading room, and so she put the Balzac into her bag and headed out.

She began to dress differently on the days she had semiotics. She took out her diamond studs, leaving her ears bare. She stood in front of the mirror wondering if her Annie Hall glasses might possibly project a New Wave look. She decided not and wore her contacts. She unearthed a pair of Beatle boots she’d bought at a church basement sale in Vinalhaven. She put up her collar, and wore more black.

In Week Four, Zipperstein assigned Umberto Eco’s The Role of the Reader. It hadn’t done much for Madeleine. She wasn’t all that interested, as a reader, in the reader. She was still partial to that increasingly eclipsed entity: the writer. Madeleine had a feeling that most semiotic theorists had been unpopular as children, often bullied or overlooked, and so had directed their lingering rage onto literature. They wanted to demote the author. They wanted a book, that hard-won, transcendent thing, to be a text, contingent, indeterminate, and open for suggestions. They wanted the reader to be the main thing. Because they were readers.

Whereas Madeleine was perfectly happy with the idea of genius. She wanted a book to take her places she couldn’t get to herself. She thought a writer should work harder writing a book than she did reading it. When it came to letters and literature, Madeleine championed a virtue that had fallen out of esteem: namely, clarity. The week after they read Eco, they read portions of Derrida’s Writing and Difference. The week after that, they read Jonathan Culler’s On Deconstruction, and Madeleine came to class ready to contribute to the discussion for the first time. Before she could do so, however, Thurston beat her to it.

“The Culler was passable at best,” Thurston said.

“What didn’t you like about it?” the professor asked him.

Thurston had his knee up against the edge of the seminar table. He pushed his chair up on its back legs, scrunching up his face. “It’s readable and everything,” he said. “And well argued and all that. But it’s just a question of whether you can use a discredited discourse—like, say, reason—to explicate something as paradigmatically revolutionary as deconstruction.”

Madeleine searched along the table for mutual eye-rolling but the other students seemed eager to hear what Thurston had to say.

“Care to elaborate?” Zipperstein said.

“Well, what I mean is, first off, reason is just a discourse like any other, right? It’s only been imbued with a sense of absolute truth because it’s the privileged discourse of the West. What Derrida’s saying is that you have to use reason because, you know, reason is all there is. But at the same time you have to be aware that language is by its very nature unreasonable. You have to reason yourself out of reasonableness.” He pulled up the sleeve of his T-shirt and scratched his bony shoulder. “Culler, on the other hand, is still operating in the old mode. Mono as opposed to stereo. So from that point of view, I found the book, yeah, a little bit disappointing.”

A silence ensued. And deepened.

“I don’t know,” Madeleine said, glancing at Leonard for support.

“Maybe it’s just me, but wasn’t it a relief to read a logical argument for once? Culler boils down everything Eco and Derrida are saying into a digestible form.”

Thurston turned his head slowly to gaze across the seminar table at her.

“I’m not saying it’s bad,” he said. “It’s fine. But Culler’s work is of a different order than Derrida. Every genius needs an explainer. That’s what Culler is for Derrida.”

Madeleine shrugged this off. “I got a lot better idea of what deconstruction is from reading Culler than from reading Derrida.”

Thurston took pains to give her point of view full consideration. “It’s the nature of a simplification to be simple,” he said.

Class ended shortly after that, leaving Madeleine fuming. As she was coming out of Sayles Hall, she saw Leonard standing on the steps, holding a Coke can. She went right up to him and said, “Thanks for the help.”

“Excuse me?”

“I thought you were on my side. Why didn’t you say anything in class?”

“First Law of Thermodynamics,” Leonard said. “Conservation of energy.”

“Didn’t you agree with me?”

“I did and I didn’t,” Leonard said.

“You didn’t like the Culler?”

“The Culler’s good. But Derrida’s a heavyweight. You can’t just write him off.”

Madeleine looked dubious, but Derrida wasn’t who she was mad at. “Considering how Thurston’s always going on about how much he worships language, you’d think he wouldn’t parrot so much jargon. He used the word phallus three times today.”

Leonard smiled. “Figures if he says it it’ll be like having one.”

“He drives me crazy.”

“You want to get some coffee?”

“And fascist. That’s another of his favorites. You know the dry cleaners on Thayer Street? He called them fascist.”

“Must have gone extra heavy on the starch.”

“Yes,” Madeleine said.

“Yes, what?”

“You just invited me for coffee.”

“I did?” Leonard said. “Yes, I did. O.K. Let’s go get coffee.”

Leonard didn’t want to go to the Blue Room. He said he didn’t like to be around college students. They headed through Wayland Arch up to Hope Street, in the direction of Fox Point.

As they walked, Leonard spat into his Coke can every so often.

“Pardon my disgusting habit,” he said.

Madeleine wrinkled up her nose. “Are you going to keep doing that?”

“No,” Leonard said. “I don’t even know why I do it. It’s just something I picked up from my rodeo days.”

At the next trash can they came to, he tossed the Coke and spat out his wad of tobacco.

Within a few blocks pretty campus plantings of tulip and daffodil gave way to treeless streets lined by working-class houses painted in cheerful hues. They passed a Portuguese bakery and a Portuguese fish store selling sardines and cuttlefish. The kids here had no yards to play in but seemed happy enough, wheeling back and forth along the blank sidewalks. Nearer the highway, there were a few warehouses and, on the corner of Wickenden, a local diner.

Leonard wanted to sit at the counter. “I need to be close to the pies,” he said. “I need to see which one is talking to me.”

As Madeleine took a stool next to him, Leonard stared at the dessert case.

“Do you remember when they used to serve slices of cheese with apple pie?” he asked.

“Vaguely,” Madeleine said.

“They don’t seem to do that anymore. You and I are probably the only two people in this place who remember it.”

“Actually, I don’t remember it,” Madeleine said.

“You don’t? Never had a little slice of Wisconsin cheddar with your apple pie? I’m sorry to hear that.”

“Maybe they’ll put a slice of cheese on a piece if you ask them.”

“I didn’t say I liked it. I’m just mourning its passage.”

The conversation lapsed. And suddenly, to her surprise, Madeleine was flooded with panic. She felt the silence like a judgment against her. At the same time, her anxiety about the silence made it even harder to speak.

Though it didn’t feel nice to be so nervous, it did feel nice, in a way. It had been a while since Madeleine had been that way around a guy.

The waitress was down at the end of the counter talking to another customer.

“So why are you taking Zipperstein’s class?” she asked.

“Philosophical interest,” Leonard said. “Literally. Philosophy’s all about theory of language right now. It’s all linguistics. So I figured I’d check it out.”

“Aren’t you a biology major, too?”

“That’s what I really am,” Leonard said. “The philosophy’s just a sideline.”

Madeleine realized that she’d never dated a science major.

“Do you want to be a doctor?”

“Right now all I want to do is get the waitress’s attention.”

Leonard waved his arm a few times to no avail. Suddenly he said, “Is it hot in here?”

Without waiting for an answer, he reached into the back pocket of his jeans and pulled out a blue bandanna, which he proceeded to put over his head, tying it in back and making a number of small, precise adjustments until he was satisfied. Madeleine watched this with a slight feeling of disappointment. She associated bandannas with hacky sack, the Grateful Dead, and alfalfa sprouts, all of which she could do without. Still, she was impressed with Leonard’s sheer size on the stool next to her. His largeness, coupled with the softness—the delicacy, almost—of his voice, gave Madeleine a strange fairytale feeling, as if she were a princess sitting beside a gentle giant.

“The thing is, though,” Leonard said, still staring in the waitress’s direction,

“I didn’t get interested in philosophy because of linguistics. I got interested for the eternal verities. To learn how to die, et cetera. Now it’s more like, ‘What do we mean when we say we die?’

‘What do we mean we mean when we say we die?’”

Finally, the waitress came over. Madeleine ordered the cottage cheese plate and coffee. Leonard ordered apple pie and coffee. When the waitress left, he spun his stool rightward, so that their knees briefly touched.

“How very female of you,” he said.

“Sorry?”

“Cottage cheese.”

“I like cottage cheese.”

“Are you on a diet? You don’t look like someone on a diet.”

“Why do you want to know?” Madeleine said.

And here, for the first time, Leonard appeared rattled. Beneath the line of the bandanna, his face colored, and he spun away, breaking eye contact. “Just curious,” he said.

In the next second, he spun back, resuming the previous conversation. “Derrida’s supposed to be a lot clearer in French,” he said. “Rumor has it his prose in French is limpid.”

“Maybe I should read it in French, then.”

“You know French?” Leonard said, sounding impressed.

“I’m not great. I can read Flaubert.”

It was then that Madeleine made a big mistake. Things were going so well with Leonard, the mood was so promising—even the weather lending a hand because, after they finished their food and left the diner, walking back to campus, a March drizzle forced them to share Madeleine’s collapsible umbrella—that a feeling came over her like those she’d had as a girl when treated to a pastry or a dessert, a happiness so fraught by an awareness of its brevity that she took the tiniest bites, making the cream puff or éclair last as long as possible. In this same way, instead of seeing where the afternoon led, Madeleine decided to check its progress, to save some for later, and she told Leonard she had to go home and study.

They didn’t kiss goodbye. They didn’t come close to it.

Leonard, hunching under the umbrella, abruptly said “Bye” and hurried off through the rain, keeping his head down. Madeleine went back to the Narragansett. She lay down on her bed, and didn’t move for a long time.

The days dragged until the next meeting of Sem 211. Madeleine arrived early, choosing a seat at the seminar table next to Leonard’s usual spot. But when he showed up, ten minutes late, he took an available chair next to the professor. He didn’t say anything in class or glance in Madeleine’s direction even once. His face looked swollen and there was a line of blemishes running down one cheek. When the class ended, Leonard was the first one out the door.

The next week he missed class entirely.

And so Madeleine was left to contend with semiotics, and with Zipperstein and his disciples, all by herself.

By now they had moved on to Derrida’s Of Grammatology. The Derrida went like this: “In that sense, it is the Aufhebung of other writings, particularly of hieroglyphic script and of the Leibnizian characteristic that had been criticized previously through one and the same gesture.” In poetic moods, the Derrida went like this: “What writing itself, in its nonphonetic moment, betrays, is life. It menaces at once the breath, the spirit, and history as the spirit’s relationship with itself. It is their end, their finitude, their paralysis.”

Since Derrida claimed that language, by its very nature, undermined any meaning it attempted to promote, Madeleine wondered how Derrida expected her to get his meaning. Maybe he didn’t. That was why he deployed so much arcane terminology, so many loop-de-looping clauses. That was why he said what he said in sentences it took a minute to identify the subjects of. (Could “the access to pluridimensionality and to a delinearized temporality” really be a subject?)

Reading a novel after reading semiotic theory was like jogging empty-handed after jogging with hand weights. After getting out of Semiotics 211, Madeleine fled to the Rockefeller Library, down to B Level, where the stacks exuded a vivifying smell of mold, and grabbed something—anything, The House of Mirth, Daniel Deronda—to restore herself to sanity. How wonderful it was when one sentence followed logically from the sentence before! What exquisite guilt she felt, wickedly enjoying narrative! Madeleine felt safe with a nineteenth-century novel. There were going to be people in it. Something was going to happen to them in a place resembling the world.

Then, too, there were lots of weddings in Wharton and Austen. There were all kinds of irresistible gloomy men.

The next Thursday, Madeleine came to class wearing a Norwegian sweater with a snowflake design. She’d gone back to her glasses. For the second week in a row, Leonard didn’t show up. Madeleine worried that he’d dropped the class, but it was too late in the semester to do that. Zipperstein said,

“Has anybody seen Mr. Bankhead? Is he sick?” Nobody knew. Thurston arrived with a girl named Cassandra Hart, both of them sniffly and heroin-pale. Taking out a black Flair pen, Thurston wrote on Cassandra’s bare shoulder,

“Not Real Skin.”

Zipperstein was in a lively mood. He’d just returned from a conference in New York, dressed differently than usual. Listening to him talk about the paper he’d given at the New School, Madeleine suddenly understood. Semiotics was the form Zipperstein’s midlife crisis had taken. Becoming a semiotician allowed Zipperstein to wear a leather jacket, to fly off to Douglas Sirk retrospectives in Vancouver, and to get all the sexy waifs in his classes. Instead of leaving his wife, Zipperstein had left the English department. Instead of buying a sports car, he’d bought deconstruction.

He sat at the seminar table now and started speaking:

“I hope you read the Semiotext(e) for this week. Apropos of Lyotard, and in homage to Gertrude Stein, let me suggest the following: the thing about desire is that there is no there there.”

That was it. That was Zipperstein’s prompt. He sat before them, blinking, waiting for somebody to reply. He appeared to have all the patience in the world.

Madeleine had wanted to know what semiotics was. She’d wanted to know what the fuss was about. Well, now she felt she knew.

But then, in Week Ten, for reasons that were entirely extracurricular, semiotics began making sense.

It was a Friday night in April, just past eleven, and Madeleine was in bed, reading. The assigned text for that week was Roland Barthes’ A Lover’s Discourse. For a book purportedly about love, it didn’t look very romantic. The cover was a somber chocolate brown, the title turquoise. There was no author photograph and only a sketchy bio, listing Barthes’ other works.

Madeleine had the book in her lap. With her right hand she was eating peanut butter straight from the jar. The spoon fit perfectly against the curve of her upper palate, allowing the peanut butter to dissolve creamily against her tongue.

Opening to the introduction, she began to read:

The necessity for this book is to be found in the following consideration: that the lover’s discourse is today of an extreme solitude.

Outside, the temperature, which had remained cold through March, had shot up into the fifties. The resulting thaw was alarming in its suddenness, drainpipes and gutters dripping, sidewalks puddling, streets flooded, a constant sound of water rushing downhill.

Madeleine had her windows open on the liquid darkness. She sucked the spoon and read on:

What we have been able to say below about waiting, anxiety, memory is no more than a modest supplement offered to the reader to be made free with, to be added to, subtracted from, and passed on to others: around the figure, the players pass the handkerchief which sometimes, by a final parenthesis, is held a second longer before handing it on. (Ideally, the book would be a cooperative: “To the United Readers and Lovers.”)

It wasn’t only that this writing seemed beautiful to Madeleine. It wasn’t only that these opening sentences of Barthes’ made immediate sense. It wasn’t only the relief at recognizing that here, finally, was a book she might write her final paper on. What made Madeleine sit up in bed was something closer to the reason she read books in the first place and had always loved them. Here was a sign that she wasn’t alone. Here was an articulation of what she had been so far mutely feeling. In bed on a Friday night, wearing sweatpants, her hair tied back, her glasses smudged, and eating peanut butter from the jar, Madeleine was in a state of extreme solitude.

It had to do with Leonard. With how she felt about him and how she couldn’t tell anyone. With how much she liked him and how little she knew about him. With how desperately she wanted to see him and how hard it was to do so.

In recent days, from her solitude, Madeleine had sent out feelers. She talked about Semiotics 211 with her roommates, mentioning Thurston, Cassandra, and Leonard. It turned out that Abby knew Leonard from her freshman year.

“What was he like?” Madeleine asked.

“Sort of intense. Really smart, but intense. He used to call me all the time. Like every day.”

“Did he like you?”

“No, he just wanted to talk. He’d keep me on the phone for an hour.”

“What did you guys talk about?”

“Everything! His relationship. My relationship. His parents, my parents. Jimmy Carter getting attacked by that swamp rabbit, which he was obsessed about. He’d go on and on.”

“Who was he going out with?”

“Some girl named Mindy. But then they broke up. That’s when he really started calling me. He’d call like six times a day. He was always going on about how good Mindy smelled. She had this smell that was supposedly perfectly compatible to Leonard, chemically. He was worried no girl would ever smell right to him again. I told him it was probably her moisturizer. He said no, it was her skin. It was chemically perfect. That’s what he’s like.” She paused and gave Madeleine a searching look. “Why are you asking? Do you like him?”

“I just know him from class,” Madeleine said.

“Do you want me to invite him for dinner?”

“I didn’t say that.”

“I’ll invite him to dinner,” Abby said.

The dinner had been on Tuesday night, three days ago. Leonard had come politely bearing a gift, a set of dish towels. He’d dressed up, wearing a white shirt with a skinny necktie, his long hair gathered in a masculine ponytail like a Scottish warrior. He was touchingly sincere, saying hello to Abby, handing her the wrapped gift and thanking her for the invitation.

Madeleine tried not to seem overeager. At dinner, she paid attention to Brian Weeger, whose breath had a dog-food smell. A couple of times, when she looked over at Leonard, he stared back, fixedly, appearing almost upset. Later, when Madeleine was in the kitchen, rinsing dishes, Leonard came in. She turned to find him inspecting a bump on the wall.

“This must be an old gas main,” he said.

Madeleine looked at the bump, which had been painted over many times.

“They used to have gas lamps in these old places,” Leonard went on.

“They probably used to pump the gas up from the basement. If anybody’s pilot blew out, on any floor, you’d have a leak. Gas didn’t have an odor back then, either. They didn’t start adding methyl mercaptan until later.”

“Good to know,” Madeleine said.

“This place must have been a powder keg.” Leonard tapped the jutting object with his fingernail, turned, and looked Madeleine meaningfully in the face.

“I haven’t been going to class,” he said.

“I know.”

Leonard’s head was way up above her, but then he bent down, in a peaceful, leaf-eater motion, and said, “I haven’t been feeling well.”

“Were you sick?”

“I’m better now.”

In the living room Olivia called out, “Who wants some Delamain? It’s yummy!”

“I want some,” Brian Weeger said. “That stuff’s killer.”

Leonard said, “Were the dish towels all right?”

“What?”

“The dish towels. I bought you some dish towels.”

“Oh, they’re great,” Madeleine said. “They’re perfect. We’ll use them! Thank you.”

“I would have brought wine, or scotch, but that’s the kind of thing my father would do.”

“You don’t want to do anything your father would do?”

Leonard’s face and voice remained solemn as he replied, “My father is a depressive who self-medicates with alcohol. My mother is more or less the same.”

“Where do they live?”

“They’re divorced. My mother still lives in Portland, where I’m from. My dad’s in Europe. He lives in Antwerp. Last time I heard.”

This interchange was encouraging, in a way. Leonard was sharing personal information. On the other hand, the information indicated that he had a troubled relationship with his parents, who were themselves troubled, and Madeleine made a point of going out only with guys who liked their parents.

“What does your father do?” Leonard asked.

Caught off guard, Madeleine hesitated. “He used to work at a college,” she said. “He’s retired.”

“What was he? Professor?”

“He was the president.”

Leonard’s face twitched. “Oh.”

“It’s just a small college. In New Jersey. It’s called Baxter.”

Abby came in to get some glasses. Leonard helped her get them off the top shelf. When she was gone, he turned back to Madeleine and said, as if in pain, “There’s a Fellini film playing at the Cable Car this weekend. Amarcord.”

Madeleine gazed encouragingly up at him. There were all kinds of outmoded, novelistic words to describe how she was feeling, words like aflutter. But she had her rules. One rule was that the guy had to ask her out, not the other way around.

“I think it’s playing on Saturday,” Leonard said.

“This Saturday?”

“Do you like Fellini?”

To reply to this question did not, in Madeleine’s view, compromise her rule.

“You want to know something embarrassing?” she said.

“I’ve never seen a Fellini film.”

“You should see one,” Leonard said.

“I’ll call you.”

“All right.”

“Do I have your number? Oh, right, I have it. It’s the same as Abby’s number.”

“Do you want me to write it down?” Madeleine asked.

“No,” Leonard said.

“I have it.”

And he rose, brontosaurus-like, to his place among the treetops.

For the rest of the week, Madeleine stayed in every night, waiting for Leonard to call. When she came back from classes in the afternoon she interrogated her roommates to find out if he had called while she was out.

“Some guy called yesterday,” Olivia said, on Thursday. “When I was in the shower.”

“Why didn’t you tell me?”

“Sorry, I forgot.”

“Who was it?”

“He didn’t say.”

“Did it sound like Leonard?”

“I didn’t notice. I was dripping wet.”

“Thanks for taking a message!”

“Sorree,” Olivia said.

“God. It was just a two-second call. He said he’d call back later.”

And so now it was Friday night—Friday night!—and Madeleine had declined to go out with Abby and Olivia in order to stay in and wait by the phone. She was reading A Lover’s Discourse and marveling at its relevance to her life.



Waiting
attente / waiting
Tumult of anxiety provoked by waiting for the loved being, subject to trivial delays (rendezvous, letters, telephone calls, returns).
… Waiting is an enchantment: I have received orders not to move. Waiting for a telephone is thereby woven out of tiny, unavowable interdictions to infinity: I forbid myself to leave the room, to go to the toilet, even to telephone (to keep the line from being busy) …

She could hear the television going in the apartment below. Madeleine’s bedroom faced the State Capitol dome, brightly lit against the dark sky. The heat, which they couldn’t control, was still on, the radiator wastefully knocking and hissing.

The more she thought about it, the more Madeleine understood that extreme solitude didn’t just describe the way she was feeling about Leonard. It explained how she’d always felt when she was in love. It explained what love was like and, just maybe, what was wrong with it.

The telephone rang.

Madeleine sat up in bed. She dog-eared the page she was reading. She waited as long as she could (three rings) before answering.

“Hello?”

“Maddy?”

It was Alton, calling from Prettybrook.

“Oh. Hi, Daddy.”

“Don’t sound so excited.”

“I’m studying.”

In his usual way, without niceties, he got to the matter at hand. “Your mother and I were just discussing graduation plans.”

For a moment, Madeleine thought Alton meant that they were discussing her future. But then she realized it was just logistics.

“It’s April,” she said. “Graduation’s not until June.”

“My experience with college towns is that the hotels get booked up months in advance. So we have to decide what we’re doing. Now, here are the options. Are you listening?”

“Yes,” Madeleine said, and began, at that instant, to tune out. She stuck the spoon back into the peanut butter jar and brought it to her mouth, this time just licking it.

In the phone Alton’s voice was saying,

“Option one: Your mother and I come up the night before the ceremony, stay in a hotel, and we see you for dinner the night of graduation. Option two: We come up the morning of the ceremony, have breakfast with you, and then leave after the ceremony. Both proposals are acceptable to us. It’s your choice. But let me explain the pros and cons of each scenario.”

Madeleine was about to answer when Phyllida spoke up on another extension.

“Hi, dear. I hope we didn’t wake you.”

“We didn’t wake her,” Alton barked. “Eleven o’clock’s not late at college. Especially on a Friday night. Hey, what are you doing in on a Friday night? Got a pimple?”

“Hi, Mummy,” Madeleine said, ignoring him.

“Maddy, sweetie, we’re redoing your bedroom and I wanted to ask you—”

“You’re redoing my bedroom?”

“Yes, it needs freshening up. I—”

“My room?”

“Yes. I was thinking about recarpeting it in green. You know, a good green.”

“No!” Madeleine cried.

“Maddy, we’ve kept your room the way it is for four years now—you’d think it was a shrine! I’d like to be able to use it as a guest room, occasionally, because of the en suite bathroom. You can still have it when you come home, don’t worry. It’ll always be your room.”

“What about my wallpaper?”

“It’s old. It’s peeling.”

“You can’t change my wallpaper!”

“Oh, all right. I’ll leave the wallpaper alone. But the carpet—”

“Excuse me,” Alton said in a peremptory tone. “This call is about graduation. Phyl, you’re hijacking my agenda. You two sort out the redecorating some other time. Now, Maddy, let me go over the pros and cons. When your cousin graduated from Williams, we all had dinner after the ceremony. And, if you’ll remember, Doats complained the whole time that he was missing all the parties—and he left halfway through the meal. Now, your mother and I are willing to stay the night—or two nights—if we’re going to see you. But if you’re going to be busy, maybe the breakfast option makes more sense.”

“Graduation’s two months away. I don’t even know what’s happening yet.”

“That’s what I told your father,” Phyllida said.

It occurred to Madeleine that she was tying up the line.

“Let me think about it,” she said abruptly. “I have to go. I’m studying.”

“If we’re going to stay the night,” Alton repeated, “I’d like to make reservations soon.”

“Call me later. Let me think about it. Call me Sunday.”

Alton was still speaking when she hung up, so when the phone rang again, twenty seconds later,

Madeleine picked up and said,

“Daddy, stop it. We don’t have to decide tonight.”

There was silence on the line. And then a male voice said, “You don’t have to call me Daddy.”

“Oh, God. Leonard? Sorry! I thought you were my father. He’s freaking out about graduation plans already.”

“I was just having a little freak-out myself.”

“About what?”

“About calling you.”

This was good. Madeleine ran a finger along her lower lip. She said, “Have you calmed down or do you want to call back later?”

“I’m resting comfortably now, thank you.”

Madeleine waited for more. None came. “Are you calling for a reason?” she asked.

“Yes. That Fellini film? I was hoping you might, if you’re not too, I know it’s bad manners calling so late, but I was at the lab.”

Leonard did sound a little nervous. That wasn’t good. Madeleine didn’t like nervous guys. Nervous guys were nervous for a reason. Up until now Leonard had seemed more the tortured type than the nervous type. Tortured was better.

“I don’t think that was a complete sentence,” she said.

“What did I leave out?” Leonard asked.

“How about, ‘Would you like to come with me?’”

“I’d be happy to,” Leonard said.

Madeleine frowned into the receiver. She had a feeling that Leonard had set up this exchange, like a chess player thinking eight moves ahead. She was going to complain when Leonard said, “Sorry. Not funny.” He comically cleared his throat. “Listen, would you like to go to the movies with me?”

She didn’t answer right away. He deserved a little punishment. And so she put the screws to him—for another three seconds.

“I’d love to.”

And there it was already, that word. She wondered if Leonard had noticed. She wondered what it meant that she had noticed. It was just a word, after all. A way of speaking.

The next night, Saturday, the fickle weather turned cold again. Madeleine was chilled in her brown suede jacket as she walked to the restaurant where they’d agreed to meet. Afterward, they made their way to the Cable Car and found a sagging couch among the other mismatched sofas and armchairs that furnished the art-house cinema.

She had a hard time following the movie. The narrative cues weren’t as crisp as those of Hollywood, and the film had a dream-like quality, lush but discontinuous. The audience, being a college audience, laughed knowingly during the risqué European moments: when the huge-titted woman stuffed her huge tit into the young hero’s mouth; or when the old man up in the tree cried out, “I want a woman!” Fellini’s theme appeared to be the same as Roland Barthes’—love—but here it was Italian and all about the body instead of French and all about the mind. She wondered if Leonard had known what Amarcord was going to be about. She wondered if it was his way of getting her in the mood. As it so happened, she was in the mood, but no thanks to the movie. The movie was pretty to look at but confused her and made her feel naïve and suburban. It seemed both overly indulgent and overly male.

After it was over, they made their way out onto South Main. They had no stated destination. Madeleine was pleased to realize that Leonard, though tall, wasn’t too tall. If she wore heels, the top of her head came up higher than his shoulders, almost to his chin.

“What did you think?” he said.

“Well, at least now I know what Felliniesque is.”

The downtown skyline was on their left, across the river, the spire of the Superman building visible against the unnaturally pink city sky. The streets were empty except for other people leaving the cinema.

“My goal in life is to become an adjective,” Leonard said. “People would go around saying, ‘That was so Bankheadian.’ Or, ‘A little too Bankheadian for my taste.’”

“Bankheadian has a ring,” Madeleine said.

“It’s better than Bankheadesque.”

“Or Bankheadish.”

“Ish is terrible all around. There’s Joycean, Shakespearean, Faulknerian. But ish? Who is there who’s an ish?”

“Thomas Mannish?”

“Kafkaesque,” Leonard said. “Pynchonesque! See, Pynchon’s already an adjective. Gaddis. What would Gaddis be? Gaddisesque? Gaddisy?”

“You can’t really do it with Gaddis,” Madeleine said.

“Yeah,” Leonard said. “Tough luck for Gaddis. Do you like him?”

“I read a little of The Recognitions,” Madeleine said.

They turned up Planet Street, climbing the slope.

“Bellovian,” Leonard said. “It’s extra nice when they change the spelling slightly. Nabokovian already has the v. So does Chekhovian. The Russians have it made. Tolstoyan! That guy was an adjective waiting to happen.”

“Don’t forget Tolstoyanism,” Madeleine said.

“My God!” Leonard said. “A noun! I’ve never even dreamed of being a noun.”

“What would Bankheadian mean?”

Leonard thought for a second. “‘Of or related to Leonard Bankhead (American, born 1959), characterized by excessive introspection or worry. Gloomy, depressive. See basket case.’”

Madeleine was laughing. Leonard stopped walking and took hold of her arm, looking at her seriously.

“I’m taking you to my place,” he said.

“What?”

“All this time we’ve been walking? I’ve been leading you back to my place. This is how I do it, apparently. It’s shameful. Shameful. I don’t want it to be like that. Not with you. So I’m telling you.”

“I figured we were going back to your place.”

“You did?”

“I was going to call you on it. When we got closer.”

“We’re already close.”

“I can’t come up.”

“Please.”

“No. Not tonight.”

“Hannaesque,” Leonard said. “Stubborn. Given to ironclad positions.”

“Hannarian,” Madeleine said. “Dangerous. Not to be messed with.”

“I stand warned.”

They stood looking at each other on cold, dark Planet Street. Leonard took his hands out of his pockets to tuck his long hair behind his ears.

“Maybe I’ll come up just for a minute,” Madeleine said.



“Special Days”
fête / festivity
The amorous subject experiences every meeting
with the loved being as a festival.
1. The Festivity is what is waited for, what is expected. What I expect of the promised presence is an unheard-of totality of pleasures, a banquet; I rejoice like the child laughing at the sight of the mother whose mere presence heralds and signifies a plenitude of satisfactions: I am about to have before me, and for myself, the “source of all good things.”
“I am living through days as happy as those God keeps for his chosen people; and whatever becomes of me, I can never say that I have not tasted the purest joys of life.”

It was debatable whether or not Madeleine had fallen in love with Leonard the first moment she’d seen him. She hadn’t even known him then, and so what she’d felt was only sexual attraction, not love. Even after they’d gone out for coffee, she couldn’t say that what she was feeling was anything more than infatuation. But ever since the night when they went back to Leonard’s place after watching Amarcordand started fooling around, when Madeleine found that instead of being turned off by physical stuff, the way she often was with boys, instead of putting up with that or trying to overlook it, she’d spent the entire night worrying that she was turning Leonard off, worrying that her body wasn’t good enough, or that her breath was bad from the Caesar salad she’d unwisely ordered at dinner; worrying, too, about having suggested they order martinis because of the way Leonard had sarcastically said,

“Sure. Martinis. We can pretend we’re Salinger characters”; after having had, as a consequence of all this anxiety, pretty much no sexual pleasure, despite the perfectly respectable session they’d put together; and after Leonard (like every guy) had immediately fallen asleep, leaving her to lie awake stroking his head and vaguely hoping she didn’t get a urinary tract infection, Madeleine asked herself if the fact that she’d just spent the whole night worrying wasn’t, in fact, a surefire sign that she was falling in love. And certainly after they’d spent the next three days at Leonard’s place having sex and eating pizza, after she’d relaxed enough to be able to come at least once in a while and finally to stop worrying so much about having an orgasm because her hunger for Leonard was in some way satisfied by his satisfaction, after she’d allowed herself to sit naked on his gross couch and to walk to the bathroom knowing he was staring at her (imperfect) ass, to root for food in his disgusting refrigerator, to read the brilliant half-page of philosophy paper sticking up out of his typewriter, and to hear him pee with taurine force into the toilet bowl, certainly, by the end of those three days, Madeleine knew she was in love.

But that didn’t mean she had to tell anyone. Especially Leonard.

Leonard Bankhead had a studio apartment on the third floor of a low-rent student building. The halls were full of bikes and junk mail. Stickers decorated the other tenants’ doors: a fluorescent marijuana leaf, a silk-screen Blondie. Leonard’s door, however, was as blank as the apartment inside. In the middle of the room, a twin mattress lay beside a plastic milk crate supporting a reading lamp. There was no desk, no bookcase, not even a table, only the nasty couch, with a typewriter on another milk crate in front of it. There was nothing on the walls but bits of masking tape and, in one corner, a small portrait of Leonard, done in pencil. The drawing showed Leonard as George Washington, wearing a tricorne hat and sheltering under a blanket at Valley Forge. The caption read:

“You go. I like it here.”

Madeleine thought the handwriting looked feminine.

A ficus tree endured in the corner. Leonard moved it into the sun whenever he remembered to. Madeleine, taking pity on the tree, began to water it, until she caught Leonard looking at her one day, his eyes narrowed with suspicion.

“What?” she said.

“Nothing.”

“Come on. What?”

“You’re watering my tree.”

“The soil’s dry.”

“You’re taking care of my tree.”

She stopped doing it after that.

There was a tiny kitchen where Leonard brewed and reheated the gallon of coffee he drank every day. A big greasy wok sat on the stove. The most Leonard did in the way of preparing a meal, however, was to pour Grape Nuts into the wok. With raisins. Raisins satisfied his fruit requirement.

The apartment had a message. The message said: I am an orphan. Abby and Olivia asked Madeleine what she and Leonard did together and she never had an answer. They didn’t do<!--?i--> anything. She came to his apartment and they lay down on the mattress and Leonard asked her how she was doing, really wanting to know.

What did they do? She talked; he listened; then he talked and she listened. She’d never met anyone, and certainly not a guy, who was so receptive, who took everything in. She guessed that Leonard’s shrink-like manner came from years of seeing shrinks himself, and though another of her rules was to never date guys who went to shrinks, Madeleine began to reconsider this prohibition. Back home, she and her sister had a phrase for serious emotional talks. They called it “having a heavy.” If a boy approached during one, the girls would look up and give warning:

“We’re having a heavy.” And the boy would retreat. Until it was over. Until the heavy had passed.

Going out with Leonard was like having a heavy all the time. Whenever she was with him, Leonard gave her his full attention. He didn’t stare into her eyes or smother her the way Billy had, but he made it clear he was available. He offered little advice. Only listened, and murmured, reassuringly.

People often fell in love with their shrinks, didn’t they? That was called transference and was to be avoided. But what if you were already sleeping with your shrink? What if your shrink’s couch was already a bed?

And plus it wasn’t all heavy, the heavies. Leonard was funny. He told hilarious stories in a deadpan voice. His head sank into his shoulders, his eyes filled with rue, as his sentences drawled on. “Did I ever tell you I play an instrument? The summer my parents got divorced, they sent me to live with my grandparents in Buffalo. The people next door were Latvian, the Bruverises. And they both played the kokle.

Do you know what a kokle is?

It’s sort of like a zither, but Latvian.

“Anyway, I used to hear Mr. and Mrs. Bruveris playing their kokles over in the next yard. It was an amazing sound. Sort of wild and over-stimulated on the one hand, but melancholy on the other. The kokle is the manic-depressive of the string family. Anyway, I was bored to death that summer. I was sixteen. Six foot one. One hundred and thirty-eight pounds. A major reefer smoker. I used to get high in my bedroom and blow the smoke out the window, and then I’d go out to the porch and listen to the Bruverises playing next door. Sometimes other people came over. Other kokle players. They set up lawn chairs in the backyard and they’d all sit there playing together. It was an orchestra! A kokle orchestra. Then one day they saw me watching and invited me over. They gave me potato salad and a grape Popsicle and I asked Mr. Bruveris how you played a kokle and he started giving me lessons. I used to go over there every day. They had an old kokle they let me borrow. I used to practice five, six hours a day. I was into it.

“At the end of that summer, when I had to leave, the Bruverises gave me the kokle. To keep. I took it on the plane with me. I got a separate seat for it, like I was Rostropovich. My father had moved out of the house by then. So it was just me, my sister, and my mother. And I kept on practicing. I got good enough that I joined this band. We used to play at ethnic festivals and Orthodox weddings. We had these traditional costumes, embroidered vests, puffy sleeves, knee-high boots. Me and all the adults. Most of them were Latvian, some Russians, too. Our big number was ‘Otchi Tchornyia.’ That’s the only thing that saved me in high school. The kokle.”

“Do you still play?”

“Hell no. Are you kidding? The kokle?”

Listening to Leonard, Madeleine felt impoverished by her happy childhood. She never wondered why she acted the way she did, or what effect her parents had had on her personality. Being fortunate had dulled her powers of observation. Whereas Leonard noticed every little thing. For instance, they spent a weekend on Cape Cod (partly to visit Pilgrim Lake Laboratory, where Leonard was applying for a research fellowship), and as they were driving back, Leonard said, “What do you do? Just hold it?”

“What?”

“You just hold it. For two days. Until you get back home.”

As his meaning seeped in, she said, “I can’t believe you!”

“You have never, ever, taken a dump in my presence.”

“In your presence?”

“When I am present. Or nearby.”

“What’s wrong with that?”

“What’s wrong with it? Nothing. If you’re talking about I-sleep-over-and-go-off-to-class-the-next-morning and then you go and take a dump, that’s understandable. But when we spend two, almost three days together, eating surf and turf, and you do not take a dump the entire time, I can only conclude that you are more than a little anal.”

“So what? It’s embarrassing!” Madeleine said.

“O.K.? I find it embarrassing.”

Leonard stared at her without expression and said, “Do you mind when I take a dump?”

“Do we have to talk about this? It’s sort of gross.”

“I think we do need to talk about it. Because you’re obviously not very relaxed around me, and I am—or thought I was—your boyfriend, and that means—or should mean—that I’m the person you’re most relaxed around. Leonard equals maximum relaxation.”

Guys weren’t supposed to be the talkers. Guys weren’t supposed to get you to open up. But this guy was; this guy did. He’d said he was her “boyfriend,” too. He’d made it official.

“I’ll try to be more relaxed,” Madeleine said, “if it’ll make you happy. But in terms of—excretion—don’t get your hopes up.”

“This isn’t for me,” Leonard said. “This is for Mr. Lower Intestine. This is for Mr. Duodenum.”

Even though this kind of amateur therapy didn’t exactly work (after that last conversation, for instance, Madeleine had more, not less, trouble going Number 2 if Leonard was within a mile), it affected Madeleine deeply. Leonard was examining her closely. She felt handled in the right way, like something precious or immensely fascinating. It made her happy to think about how much he thought about her.

By the end of April, Madeleine and Leonard had gotten into a routine of spending every night together. On weeknights, after Madeleine finished studying, she headed over to the biology lab, where she’d find Leonard staring at slides with two Chinese grad students. After she finally got Leonard to leave the lab, Madeleine then had to cajole him into sleeping at her place. At first, Leonard had liked staying at the Narragansett. He liked the ornate moldings and the view from her bedroom. He charmed Olivia and Abby by making pancakes on Sunday mornings. But soon Leonard began to complain that they always stayed at Madeleine’s place and that he never got to wake up in his own bed. Staying at Leonard’s place, however, required Madeleine to bring a fresh set of clothes each night, and since he didn’t like her to leave clothes at his place (and, to be honest, she didn’t like to, either, because whatever she left picked up a fusty smell), Madeleine had to carry her dirty clothes around to classes all day. She preferred sleeping at her own apartment, where she could use her own shampoo, conditioner, and loofah, and where it was “clean-sheet day” every Wednesday. Leonard never changed his sheets. They were a disturbing gray color. Dust balls clung to the edges of the mattress. One morning, Madeleine was horrified to see a calligraphic smear of blood that had leaked from her three weeks earlier, a stain she’d attacked with a kitchen sponge while Leonard was sleeping.

“You never wash your sheets!” she complained.

“I wash them,” Leonard said evenly.

“How often?”

“When they get dirty.”

“They’re always dirty.”

“Not everyone can drop off their laundry at the cleaners every week. Not everybody grew up with ‘clean-sheet day.’”

“You don’t have to drop them off,” Madeleine said, undeterred. “You’ve got a washer in the basement.”

“I use the washer,” Leonard said. “Just not every Wednesday. I don’t equate dirt with death and decay.”

“Oh, and I do? I’m obsessed with death because I wash my sheets?”

“People’s attitudes to cleanliness have a lot to do with their fear of death.”

“This isn’t about death, Leonard. This is about crumbs in the bed. This is about the fact that your pillow smells like a liverwurst sandwich.”

“Wrong.”

“It does!”

“Wrong.”

“Smell it, Leonard!”

“It’s salami. I don’t like liverwurst.”

To a certain extent, this kind of arguing was fun. But then came nights when Madeleine forgot to pack a change of clothes and Leonard accused her of doing this on purpose in order to force him to sleep at her place. Next, more worryingly, came nights when Leonard said he was going home to study and would see her tomorrow. He began pulling all-nighters. One of his philosophy professors offered Leonard the use of his cabin in the Berkshires and, for an entire rainy weekend, Leonard went there, alone, to write a paper on Fichte, returning with a typescript 123 pages long and wearing a bright orange hunter’s vest. The vest became his favorite item of clothing. He wore it all the time.

He started finishing Madeleine’s sentences. As if her mind was too slow. As if he couldn’t wait for her to gather her thoughts. He riffed on the things she said, going off on strange tangents, making puns. Whenever she told him he needed to get some sleep, he got angry and didn’t call her for days. And it was during this period that Madeleine fully understood how the lover’s discourse was of an extreme solitude. The solitude was extreme because it wasn’t physical. It was extreme because you felt it while in the company of the person you loved. It was extreme because it was in your head, that most solitary of places.

The more Leonard pulled away, the more anxious Madeleine became. The more desperate she became, the more Leonard pulled away. She told herself to act cool. She went to the library to work on her marriage-plot thesis, but the sex-fantasy atmosphere—the reading-room eye contact, the beckoning stacks—made her desperate to see Leonard. And so against her will her feet began leading her back across campus through the darkness to the biology department. Up to the last moment, Madeleine had the crazy hope that this expression of weakness might in fact be strength. It was a brilliant strategy because it lacked all strategy. It involved no games, only sincerity. Seeing such sincerity, how could Leonard fail to respond? She was almost happy as she came up behind the lab table and tapped Leonard on the shoulder, and her happiness lasted until he turned around with a look not of love but of annoyance.

It didn’t help that it was spring. Every day, people seemed more and more unclothed. The magnolia trees, budding on the green, looked positively enflamed. They sent out a perfume that drifted through the windows of Semiotics 211. The magnolia trees hadn’t read Roland Barthes. They didn’t think love was a mental state; the magnolias insisted it was natural, perennial.

On a beautiful warm May day, Madeleine showered, shaved her legs with extra care, and put on her first spring dress: an apple-green baby-doll dress with a bib collar and a high hem. With this, she wore Buster Browns, cream and rust, and went sockless. Her bare legs, toned from a winter of squash-playing, were pale but smooth. She kept her glasses on, left her hair loose, and walked over to Leonard’s apartment on Planet Street. On the way, she stopped at a market to buy a hunk of cheese, some Stoned Wheat Thins, and a bottle of Valpolicella. Coming down the hill from Benefit toward South Main, she felt the warm breeze between her thighs. The front door of Leonard’s building was propped open with a brick, so she went up to his apartment and knocked. Leonard opened the door. He looked like he’d been napping.

“Niiiiice dress,” he said.

They never made it to the park. They picnicked on each other. As Leonard pulled her toward the mattress, Madeleine dropped her packages, hoping the wine bottle didn’t break. She slipped her dress over her head. Soon they were naked, raiding, it felt like, a huge basket of goodies. Madeleine lay on her stomach, her side, her back, nibbling all the treats, the nice-smelling fruit candies, the meaty drumsticks, as well as more sophisticated offerings, the biscotti flavored with anise, the wrinkly truffles, the salty spoonfuls of olive tapenade. She’d never been so busy in her life. At the same time, she felt strangely displaced, not quite her usual tidy ego but merged with Leonard into a great big protoplasmic, ecstatic thing. She thought she’d been in love before. She knew she’d had sex before. But all those torrid adolescent gropings, all those awkward backseat romps, the meaningful, performative summer nights with her high school boyfriend Jim McManus, even the tender sessions with Billy where he insisted they look into each other’s eyes as they came—none of that prepared her for the wallop, the all-consuming pleasure, of this.

Leonard was kissing her. When she could bear no more, Madeleine grabbed him savagely by his ears. She pulled Leonard’s head away and held it still to show him the evidence of how she felt (she was crying now). In a hoarse voice edged with something else, a sense of peril, Madeleine said, “I love you.”

Leonard stared back at her. His eyebrows twitched. Suddenly, he rolled sideways off the mattress. He stood up and walked, naked, across the room. Crouching, he reached into her bag and pulled out A Lover’s Discourse, from the pocket where she always kept it. He flipped the pages until he found the one he wanted. Then he returned to the bed and handed the book to her.

I Love You
je-t’aime / I-love-you

As she read these words, Madeleine was flooded with happiness. She glanced up at Leonard, smiling. With his finger he motioned for her to keep going. The figure refers not to the declaration of love, to the avowal, but to the repeated utterance of the love cry.<!--?i--> Suddenly Madeleine’s happiness diminished, usurped by the feeling of peril. She wished she weren’t naked. She narrowed her shoulders and covered herself with the bedsheet as she obediently read on.

Once the first avowal has been made, “I love you"" has no meaning whatever …

Leonard, squatting, had a smirk on his face.

It was then that Madeleine threw the book at his head.Embed"

Up on the Three Two Ave
I wake up every morning tryna figure how to start my day
I go to the bathroom then take me a piss
Brush my teeth now it's time to parlé
I call up B Money to open the crib
So it's time to go jet so I skate (open the door nigga)
I'm rolling and blousing and coughing these ounces
These money roll a whole 28
Took 8 grams
Bumping 99' jams reminiscing on the town last week
Talk about a cop cherry tops run a block
In a baja saying that the youngin' had heat
Spur of the moment
The youngin' was dumb as he died from a fatal attack
On the 207 called 9-11
Hit 15 bullets to his back
Shit got whack
Everybody really on that but you just got to embrace it
Keep it on the churches like it’s braces
Murder Gardens Carol City unsolved cases
Face it, you get wasted like it's GTA
But this ain't no Grove Street and you ain't CJ, nigga

Gem golds in my mouth and my dreads lookin' like a palm-tree
Plus you know what a nigga's skin tone is, so that's why they fuck with me

Get the product then we out the door
Mama I've been twistin' weed
And now it's time to lock the fro, blowin' dro
Call me knotty head cause I don't give a fuck
I was raised off in the projects, know this life ain't meant for us
Bitch I can't be touched
Get the product then we out the door
Mama I've been twistin' weed
And now it's time to lock the fro, let it go
Call me knotty head and if I ever go
Tell my mama that I love her cause tomorrow not for sure
I would never know

Tote a 4 and pour some liq'
I'ma tote that stick until they send me to the pen
This the way it is, I gotta get it how I live

Do you know what love is?
Do you know that love got a thin line?
When the hate comes in, do you switch sides?
When you separate yourself, do you need time
To think it over? Who genuine or who usin' you
What you first instinct?
Number two, what would you do?
If I was you, I don't know
I guess, at the end of the day
I'ma say what I say at the price of being friendless
It's hard to show love at times
When I see that the same bullshit is endless
No love when that person is envious
And for the insecure remaining impotent
I always been in the midst of it
And, from the gist of it, I do not give a shit
(I, I) I fight with the bros sometimes
I fight with the hoes sometimes
I fight with my girl sometimes
I fight with the world sometimes
At the top, but some can't climb
On the move, still on my grind
'Cause love can make you blind
But you gotta show love sometimes

Black M,LAVÏ$H HABiTS (Gothika),"1 ContributorDear White People Screenplay Lyrics1 NEWS BROADCAST - VARIOUS SCREENS, VARIOUS PLACES 1
ANCHOR
A “race war” has erupted at one of
the nation’s oldest and most
prestigious institutions.
Glued to this are our story’s subjects, who we meet in...
2 A SERIES OF SHOTS 2
TROY FAIRBANKS, 21, Black. He drags a brush through his
finger waves anxiously. The look of guilt is the only mark
of imperfection in his privileged and chiseled demeanor.
ANCHOR (O.S.)
Outrage over an “African American
Themed” party organized by
predominately white students of
Manchester University has resulted
in rioting and property damages.
2A KURT FLETCHER, 21, white. No sympathy in his jaded blue 2A
eyes as he watches on an iPad in a lavish parlor room.
ANCHOR (O.S.) (CONT’D)
Guests were invited to “liberate
their inner Negro, fry up chicken,
enjoy a sugar water concoction
known as Purple drank and wear
oversized Barack Obama T-shirts.”
2B COLANDREA CONNERS (COCO), 20, Black with blue contacts 2B
adjusts the straight bangs of her weave to better see the
small TV in her dorm. A smirk on her glossy pink lips. *
ANCHOR (CONT’D)
Officials claim an investigation is
underway to find those responsible
for the event and subsequent riot.
2C SAMANTHA WHITE (SAM) 21, records the broadcast in an 2C
edit bay. Despite her light skin, the Afro pick in her fro
pompadour leaves little doubt she identifies as Black.
ANCHOR (CONT’D)
In an effort to address diversity
issues, the school appointed
African American scholar Dr. Walter
Fairbanks as Dean of Students.
2D LIONEL HIGGINS, 20, Black, watches through dark rimmed 2D
glasses in a bustling indifferent Dining Hall. A guilt pains
his otherwise boyish face.
ANCHOR (CONT’D)
Last year the Dean’s office
celebrated slight gains in diverse
applicants but with many now
calling for Fairbanks' resignation,
that may have been pre-mature.
2E DEAN WALTER FAIRBANKS, a well adorned Black man in his 2E
50’s fights a panic as he watches in a stately office.
ANCHOR (CONT’D)
Up next, a cat that loves to water
ski? That and more after the break.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
How could this happen?

4 INT. STUDIO BOOTH - DAY 4

Sorry, but your weed man Tyrone

her autograph on the books.

Disheveled caffeinated writers of the MANCHESTER BUGLE.

insecure nature as plain as the unkempt fro on his head.
SUPERIMPOSE: LIONEL HIGGINS, JUNIOR, PHILOSOPHY UNDECLARED
STUDENTS shove past him - one even slaps a flyer into his
already full hands. Lionel’s a guppy. The kind that gets
eaten alive in a tank of sharks.
As Lionel gets to the door of a large Colonial style home he
checks his pockets. He’s missing something. Shit.
LIONEL
(knocking)
Kurt! You home?
Lionel dials on his cell and we hear the PHONE RING from
inside. Voicemail pops on with a voice other than Lionel’s.
ANSWERING MACHINE
Hey boyssss, you’ve reached Lionel
Higginsss, the only bitch on
campussss who’ll give you a
dickssscount. That’s right hunty,
the bigger the dick the less you’ll
have to pay me to ssssuck it.
The beep sounds. Lionel’s in shock. Should he hang up? Or...
LIONEL
Kurt. It’s Lionel. I’m locked out.
As Lionel slides down the length of the door into a sit he
unfolds the flyer he was just handed. It’s a rendering of Sam
White on a carton of milk with the caption:
“MISSING BLACK CULTURE - SAM WHITE TO BRING IT BLACK”
3.
6 EXT. MANCHESTER ROW - DAY 6
Signs scream out “ORIENTATION” as jazz music wafts from the
laptops of a group of NEO BEATNIKS. As the music fades...
SAM (O.S.)
Dear White People, apparently
Morgan Freeman in “Deep Impact”
wasn’t enough. Despite two terms
Obama could cure Cancer and
somewhere White folks will be
embroiled in protest. And he’s only
half Black.
GABE, 24, white and ruggedly handsome in spite of his shaggy
hair and “laundry day” flip flop clad ensemble, catches the
end of this as he passes - grabs his cell phone and dials...
7 INT. STUDIO BOOTH - DAY 7

INTERCUT with Gabe walking about on campus.
GABE
What would you say if someone

11 INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 11
Colandrea Conners (Coco) trains her unnaturally blue eyes
right at us from a Youtube page pulled up on an iPad. She’s
got an entitled air about her. Even her cusses sound erudite.
COCO (YOUTUBE)
...I am! The whole point of
randomized housing is to mix shit
up. I’m out here trying to find the
Olivier to my Halle Berry, and
they’ve got me looking like an
extra on a Different World...
The video ends with a click. Looking up is HELMUT WEST, a
30’s something Black man in dark rimmed glasses and trendy
everything. Too stylish for this place. If he’s impressed,
it’s barely perceptible.
HELMUT

Coco gets up to leave. Tries to recover.
COCO
So what’s this show about anyway?
HELMUT
Here’s the way reality works
sweetheart, I’m the producer. I ask
the questions. Be in touch.
And with that Helmut hustles Coco out. He sits and ponders
before unmuting his iPad.

Yes Oprah may have her own network,
but Ann Coulter is still writing
best sellers, Black kids are still

and even here the few vestiges of
Black culture are under attack by
conservative groups, trustees and

Helmut double checks his app fighting a genuine grin.
HELMUT
This is the school radio?
13 INT. ARMSTRONG / PARKER HALL - DAY 13
A pristine pair of Retro Jordans make their way through the
halls of Armstrong / Parker where Black students have lively
debates, flirt and bump the student radio.
SAM (O.S.)
Dear White People, thanks to the

TROY

Coco and SOFIA FLETCHER, a dewy-eyed, pink lipped brunette
who exudes a kind of sexy boredom saunter down the halls.
SOFIA
Your hair is so cute B. T. Dubs.
COCO
You’re so cute.
SOFIA
Is it weaved?
Coco’s face is a battle between fury and polite surprise.
SOFIA (CONT’D)
I saw “Good Hair” in Afro studies.
COCO

Hey what house did you get?
SOFIA
Huh? Oh Bechet bitch.
COCO
Of course. The mere thought of a

SOFIA
Easy, it was the luck of the draw.

Coco rolls her eyes behind a smile.

Sofia eyes the delicious morsels of chocolate boys about.

They turn the corner to spot Troy greeting more new
Sophomores. Coco’s caught off guard by his looks.
COCO
Cute...

glance)
...for a Black boy.
Troy sees Sofia and flashes his trademark grin. They kiss.
SOFIA
Hey boo. This is my friend Coco.
She’s new to the house.
TROY
Hey I’m Troy. Welcome to Armstrong

SOFIA
-- Are we on duty?
TROY
Head of House is always on duty.
COCO
Nice to meet you. I should get
settled. Thanks Sof!
Sofia and Troy smile as Coco turns to go - and continue down
the hallway. Coco sneaks one last glance at Troy’s ass.
TROY
Think I got time for a quick cut?
SOFIA
You got it cut last week.
TROY

...Kurt Fletcher - flanked by guys who share his cynical
knowing glare. We recognize them from the “Pastiche” portrait
from before.
As they chow down on Mac & Cheese in the Dining Hall - Kurt’s
glare burns particularly hot towards Troy who waves at him.
KURT
Sis.
Sofia smiles at her brother Kurt. Troy covers the sting of
his dismissal.
They both spot Sam’s “Missing: Black culture” flyers.
TROY
Is she kidding with this?
SOFIA
You don’t have to run again. Just
because it’s her doesn’t mean --
TROY
-- I can’t let Sam and her wannabe
Black Panthers take the House. The
House needs me. This is who I am.
SOFIA
It’s who he wants you to be.
Troy smiles over his irritation. This is an old fight.
TROY
Oh so you pick up a Psych class you
think you Freud or something? Huh?
SOFIA
A Freud reference. Sophisticated.

Troy gets a kiss out of her as they pass a booth featuring
stacks of Sam’s “EBONY & IVY.” The booth is manned by REGGIE,
21, Black - his fro top and preppy punk attire is both
bohemian and radical.
Troy glares at Sam’s picture on the book. It’s on. There’s a
history between Sam and Troy. Off Reggie’s laptop we hear...
SAM (O.S.)
Dear White People, this just in.
Dating a Black person to piss off
your parents is a form of racism.
Sofia walks off as Troy hears snickers from around him.
REGGIE
Yo Troy I forget. Is your major in
shucking or was it jiving?
TROY
My major’s in Jive. Minoring in
Shuck. You’re still majoring in
trying to fuck my left overs right?
Troy walks off as Reggie and Kurt watch him join Sofia.
SOFIA
You need a shower.
15 INT. TROY’S BATHROOM - DAY 15
Water runs while Troy takes a hit of weed from a pipe over
the toilet. He blows the smoke out an open window through a
paper towel tube with a dryer sheet attached to its end. He
jots something down on a notepad as he whispers...
TROY

The audience is in STITCHES at this last line. Everyone
except Sam, Reggie and their crew of afro’d bohemian
disciples (who we’ll call the BOFROS). Sam records the
proceedings with a vintage Super 8 camera.
REGGIE
That’s his platform? Haircuts?
SAM
Oofta is as Oofta does.
Coco, sneaks through the door. She’s got the eyes of Helmut
on her. What is he doing here? As Coco breaks eye contact she
sits in the only open spot next to...
SAM (CONT’D)
Just because we’re colored don’t
mean we run on colored people time.
COCO
Boycotting hot combs don’t make you

Coco wafts her silky hair over her shoulders and sits.
TROY
No but seriously, I care about you
guys. I care about this house. We
had a great year last year and if
it ain’t broke...
Troy basks in his applause. Coco eats him up with her eyes.
Sam doesn’t want to get up - her breathing gets heavier.
REGGIE
Just pretend like you’re in the
booth. Just you and the mic.
SAM
Hate this shit.
As Sam gets up and passes Troy --
TROY
You really think you can take this
from me?
SAM
Troy we live in a world where
there’s a Big Momma’s House 3. I
don’t have a chance in hell. Thank

Sam grabs the mic. Her voice shakes before the silent crowd.
SAM (CONT’D)
Troy my brother, it’s broke.
The BoFros cheer and make noise on each line.
SAM (CONT’D)
Troy’s a legacy kid. And yet it’s
under his watch that Armstrong /
Parker, the bastion of Black
culture here was gutted. By the
Randomization of Housing Act.
Second years of color no longer
have a say in where they go. The
culture that’s been fostered in
this house for two decades will be
wiped out in two years.
Troy looks to see if the speech is working. As Sam warms up --
SAM (CONT’D)
This wasn’t motivated by a desire
to mix things up. Bring about
racial and socioeconomic harmony.
No, the Black kids are sitting
together in the proverbial
cafeteria and they must be up to no
good.
Coco’s eyes are in the back of her head.
SAM (CONT’D)
We sit together to protect
ourselves. Over a century of houses
grouped by sports affiliations,
political leanings, majors, you
name it. Black folks get their own
house, suddenly we got a problem?
Students look at each other stunned. Are they turning? Sam
delivers the next one directly at Sofia and Troy.
SAM (CONT’D)
This Act doesn’t affect the other
houses like it does ours. There are
plenty of trustees, former coaches,
and presidents watching out for the
others. All we have is a Dean who’d
rather please his massa --
TROY
-- Yo that’s enough of that Sam --
13.
SAM
-- then stand up for his own. Look,
I know ya’ll ain’t voting for me.
Ya’ll ain’t ready and I didn’t come
here for that. The Black Student
Union and I have brought a petition
to repeal the Randomization of
Housing Act. I plan on bringing it
to the President and together we
can bring Black back to Manchester.
It’ll be by the door.
Sam sits as claps trickle from the crowd. The BoFros go crazy
- give her daps and all sorts of praise.
MARTIN, 20, a gentle erudite giant of a football player with
neat braids tucked under a Fedora raises a hand.
MARTIN
I assume everyone has the app I
created by now?
REGGIE
(aside)
It’s a child’s app...
MARTIN
Good. Voting may commence.
Everyone takes out smart phones. Reggie hides his from view
as he punches something in.
Troy spots the white Sophomores he greeted from before who
give him a head nod. Troy’s got this. After a moment...
MARTIN (CONT’D)
Okay. Looks like we’ve got
ourselves a winner.
(devastated)
Sam White?
The blood drains from Sam’s face and Troy’s smile plummets
into the floor as the two turn to look at each other.
TROY & SAM
Oh shit.
Reggie’s grin is from ear to ear as Helmut walks over and
slips a card to a still stunned Sam. Coco watches him go.
17 INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT 17
Right on the heels of Helmut’s exit is...
14.
COCO
So that’s what you’re looking for?
HELMUT
I’m looking for good TV sister.
COCO
I think I’d be good TV.
HELMUT
You’re at a great school, getting a
great education. Be good at that.
COCO
I am. And when I graduate early
with an Economics degree from
Manchester it will be the crowning
achievement of my Black middle
class parents’ ambitions.
HELMUT
Conflict is a commodity in my
industry. Sam’s got it. Do you?
COCO
So you want me to start a fight.
HELMUT
(exactly)
I don’t want you to do anything you
wouldn’t otherwise do.
Helmut hands her his card. A fire sparks in Coco as he exits.
He contemplates her. Fights a growing smile.
18 INT. DEAN’S OFFICE - DAY 18
A fireplace rages behind Lionel who stares at the floor while
the message plays over speaker phone.
SPEAKER
...bigger the dick the less you’ll
have to pay me to ssssuck it.
Dean Fairbank’s mind ticks away behind a concerned glare.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
Most everything’s locked up, but
we’ll find another residence to
move you to. Third time’s a charm.
(off Lionel’s sigh)
What about Armstrong / Parker?
15.
LIONEL
I don’t know...
DEAN FAIRBANKS
I might have an opening. Maybe it’d
be good to be around...you know.
LIONEL
Dean. The worst thing about high
school, and believe me it was a
long list, were the Black kids.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
Maybe it’s in your head. Sure,
sometimes our folks can be
intolerant around people like you.
Homo --
LIONEL
-- I don’t believe in labels.
Fairbanks just smiles. This is a sore spot and he backs off.
Lionel glares up at a poster above Fairbank’s desk: Students
of all races on the steps of Ellington Library including Troy
with the phrase “MANCHESTER: WHERE YOU BELONG” printed below.
Troy’s huge smile seems to mock him.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
You like jazz Lionel? Manchester’s
like jazz you know.
LIONEL
This is a research school.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
And jazz is tension. The interplay
of improvised solos all creating
one song. Your problem is you’ve
got no instrument. No major, no
affiliations, no solo son.
LIONEL
I submit articles to the
Independent Observer.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
No one reads the Independent
Observer, my point is are you
playing swing or bebop?
LIONEL
You’re mixing metaphors.
16.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
Are you a sax or are you a trumpet?
LIONEL
I hate jazz.
Fairbanks checks his watch. All out of ideas.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
I’ll do what I can. Not a word of
this in the Observer okay?
LIONEL
What’s it matter? No one reads it.
19 EXT. MANCHESTER - DAY 19
Lionel walks alone through the buzzing campus. He looks out
to..
...a group of BLACK KIDS. He sees a version of himself
amongst them - his hair a finger waved Ceasar fade, as he
trades “No Homo’s” with the others.
Lionel shakes it off. Peers over to a group of out and proud
gay kids and sees a version of himself amongst them - his
hair straightened and coifed in a fitted shirt laughing.
Not right either. Where does he fit? By surprise...
GEORGE
Lionel right?
GEORGE PIERCE, 24, an intellectual whose tattooed quotes from
Nietzsche peek out seductively from under his button up.
GEORGE (CONT’D)
George. We had Civ last semester?
How you doing?
LIONEL
Grood...Gate...I’m ah..
GEORGE
Fan of your stuff. In the Observer?
LIONEL
No one reads the Observer.
GEORGE
You seen this?
George hands Lionel Sam’s “Missing Black Culture” flyer.
17.
GEORGE (CONT’D)
The residents of Armstrong / Parker
just made her head of house. Am I
crazy or is there a there there?
LIONEL
What made you come over here?
George holds up Sam’s “Ebony & Ivy.” Lionel takes it.
LIONEL (CONT’D)
I mean I’m glad you came --
GEORGE
-- My staff? God bless them.
They’re whiter than Michael
Jackson’s kids. We’re fucked if
anyone of them writes this story
and I will not let the transfers at
the Gazette do it first.
LIONEL
The oldest one has his face.
GEORGE
You’re in the Black Student Union.
You probably know Sam.
Lionel shakes his head “yes” and “no” at the same time.
GEORGE (CONT’D)
You come up with a good angle? I
want it in the Bugle.
Lionel eyes the bold “Bugle” logo on George’s shirt.
LIONEL
(aside)
Trumpet...
GEORGE
Bugle. Focus. The only paper on
campus with a national subscription
base and an Advisor from the New
York Times? Only so many ways a
person can distinguish themselves
at a place like this Lionel. You’re
good. You belong with us.
The way Lionel fights the smile creeping up his face - we
know he’s never heard these words. Never belonged any place.
Doesn’t hurt there’s a handsome boy smiling at him either.
18.
20 INT. ARMSTRONG/PARKER DINING HALL - DAY 20
Troy and Sam sit across from each other at a table. Their
opposite facing laptops and a world of tension put a wall
between them.
TROY
Get it yet?
Sam shakes her head yes.
TROY (CONT’D)
Good. You’ve now got the shared
calendar, contacts, and official
email.
Troy throws a smirk her way before pulling out a thick stack
of papers.
TROY (CONT’D)
Oh and before I forget.
SAM
Event requests for the year?
TROY
Just this month. They need your
approval. Also don’t forget to pick
your office hours. At least 20 per
week.
SAM
That’s absurd.
TROY
You’re in charge of a hundred
residents now. And they need time
to complain to your face. About
noise. Leaky pipes. Gluten free
options in the cafeteria. Etcetera.
SAM
Troy. I didn’t think I was going to
win.
TROY
And by the way petitioning the
President on the Randomization of
Housing Act isn’t gonna do shit.
None of the other houses are
concerned.
19.
SAM
Because they all have a legacy of
rich and powerful allies on the
board who will make sure that
“random” works out to their
advantage.
TROY
And you think a petition is going
to change that?
Troy gets up to leave as Reggie sits - suspicious. Sam’s
phone buzzes: “MOM.” The letters chill Sam to the core.
21 INT. ARMSTRONG / PARKER - DAY 21
Lionel steps his way through the hall, a deer in headlights
with a notepad. He flips through Sam’s “EBONY & IVY” book...
SAM (V.O.)
The Armstrong / Parker dining hall
is the epicenter of Black culture
as it stands at Manchester. Only
here can you commiserate, celebrate
and discuss everything from Kanye
West lyrics to theoretical
relativism all in one sitting. Not
to mention find someone who can
actually do your hair.
ARMSTRONG / PARKER DINING HALL - CONTINUOUS
Lionel enters and takes a place in a line. He absorbs this
lively and somewhat alien dining hall.
Troy now holds court near the windows at a table of eight or
so friends including Martin and SUNGMI, a lip ringed Korean
art major.
MARTIN
“We wuz robbed.” That election was
suspect man.
Martin glares at Reggie and his giant souped-up Laptop. Sam
breaks this by sitting back down - her phone call ending.
SAM
You call me the minute there’s an
update. Love you too mom.
Sam hangs up. The call’s really put her in a bad place. She
sits at a table of her Bofros - who we’ll name by their hair.
20.
CURLS
There is one other sister in my
Relativity class, I’ll be damned if
our professor doesn’t call me
Laretta every God damn time.
DREADS
We all look the same.
REGGIE
Programming professor gets me and
Martin here mixed up constantly.
MARTIN
You should be so lucky.
Reggie glances over at Martin’s Mac Air.
REGGIE
Cute. You get that at Toys R Us?
Sam pulls out her Mac and her student ID card.
REGGIE (CONT’D)
You still using your ID number?
SAM
I always forget passwords.
REGGIE
You are begging to get hacked.
SAM
Good thing the one evil technogenius
thinking like that is on my
side.
Sam pushes aside all the paperwork on her table.
SAM (CONT’D)
So this is what the revolution
looks like? Office hours and
paperwork.
Sam pulls her camera out - starts to shoot the room.
REGGIE
Winning was a happy accident. We
want the reform repealed right?
CURLS
Means to an end, sister.
21.
Sam feels the heat of her disciples’ eyes on her as the topic
of the day rages on with the entrance of Coco, who sits with
a group of well manicured hot-ironed group of girls, white
and Black.
COCO
The talented tenth always has to
bust its ass a little bit harder,
but I don’t see the benefit in
blaming white folks for everything.
CURLS
Who’s blaming?
TROY
I don’t see the issue. I never had
one. Never ran into any lynch mobs.
Lionel takes a seat alone facing the action.
Kurt and crew enter with plates of mac and cheese and sit in
the heart of the conversation. Lionel avoids eye contact.
SAM
Lynch mob is still there. Just rebranded
itself.
TROY
As what pray tell?
REGGIE
The Republican party.
SAM
Want to know how this world sees
you? Go to a Young Republican’s
meeting and bring up Welfare.
SUNGMI
Or Immigration.
LIONEL
(aside)
Or gay equality.
KURT
Bullshit.
MARTIN
I agree. Got something to add?
KURT
The biggest athletes, movie stars,
hell your president is Black.
22.
(MORE)
Sometimes I think the hardest thing
to be in the American work force
right now is an educated white guy.
SUNGMI
You’re not serious.
KURT
You guys still got affirmative
action, you’re set.
REGGIE
This shit.
SAM
What are you doing in here?
KURT
Obama. Leader of the free world got
into Harvard on affirmative action.
Know who’s not president right now?
The guy that didn’t get in.
SAM
On behalf of the colored folks in
the room, let me apologize for all
the better qualified white students
whose place we’re taking up.
Kurt chuckles - a bit turned on by the argument.
SAM (CONT’D)
You get lost? Bechet is that way.
KURT
Yeah but what other dining hall
gives you chicken and waffles? Dear
White People right? Funny stuff.
How haven’t we staffed you yet?
SAM
On Pastiche? Your uninspired humor
magazine?
KURT
We’re a lot more than a magazine
sweetie. SNL staff is basically
half Lampoon, half Pastiche. Just
like the network comedies.
A flash of envy comes over Troy and Coco.
23.
KURT (CONT'D)
SAM
What gives you Clubhouse kids the
right to come to our Dining Hall?
Kurt eats an exaggerated scoop of mac and cheese.
SAM (CONT’D)
You don’t live here.
MARTIN
Sam? What are you doing?
SAM
You can’t eat here.
Kurt eyes this new adversary. Enjoys a good challenge.
TROY
Chill Sam damn. Let the man--
KURT & SAM
-- I got this.
KURT
Who are you to put me out?
SAM
(realizing)
I’m the Head of this house. And I’m
doing things my way.
Sam shoots this last one to Martin. Kurt rolls his eyes to
which Sam slams his tray to the ground.
Lionel scribbles down notes furiously on a notepad.
KURT
You got any idea who you’re --
SAM
-- Yeah, I know who your daddy is.
The same one who’s been pushing to
break up this House for a decade.
What’s wrong? Is he scared letting
the Negroes gather in groups might
start a rebellion on the
plantation? You tell him from
me...he should be.
Kurt looks into Sam’s eyes and then his crew. They want out.
KURT
Bad move.
24.
Kurt leads his crew out of the dining hall drawing a slight
snicker from Lionel which draws Sam’s eyes right to him.
Something sparks in Lionel. He takes out his phone and texts
to GEORGE: “I’ve got the angle. I’m in.”
SAM
You too.
LIONEL
Me?
SAM
Is this your house?
Lionel sinks - the eyes of everyone in the room on him.
Sam sits back down as a trickle of claps grow to a steady
applause. Troy and his table look around baffled.
By the caution on Sam’s face it seems the first time she’s
ever heard this sound directed at her.
A slight envy boils in Coco.
One last look to the room from Lionel before he slips out.
Locked out again.
23 INT. COCO’S ROOM - DAY 23
Coco scrolls Sam’s “Dear White People” Youtube page. 75K
Subscribers. She presses play on the latest video.
SAM (O.S.)
Dear White People, stop dancing.
Two seconds. 600K views.
COCO
The fuck?
Coco exits and opens her own “TIME AT AN IVY LEAGUE” page. 2K
subscribers. Her latest video is at 10K views. Alright... She
presses record. Let’s the camera rest on her briefly...
COCO (CONT’D)
Muffins. I hate to do it, but Imma
have to get real Black with you.
(comes to mind)
So the other day, a girl had the
nerve to fix her mouth and ask me
if my hair was weaved.
(after a moment)
Weaved. Weaved bitch?
25.
(MORE)
First of all if you’re going to fix
your mouth to ask me something like
that, say it right please? It’s
weave. Noun. Present tense. Second
of all don’t assume just because
you see a sister with some hair
it’s a weave. Is it? Clearly. If a
bitch could grow straight Indian
hair directly out her own head I
wouldn’t have just overdrafted my
account paying for this shit but
that ain’t your business. Are those
your lips sweetie? Sweet heart is
that really your skin? These white
girls and these tans I swear to
God, they’re starting to look
darker than me.
Coco pauses it. Her mouse hovers over the check box next to
“private.” Instead she plays it back...and hits “publish.”
She clicks back through to Sam’s last video and hits “reply.”
As the red light on her computer’s web cam turns green...
COCO (CONT’D)
Dear White People. What do I think
about it?
24 INT. SCREENING ROOM - DAY 24
Sam with arms folded watches as Gabe (Sam’s caller from
earlier) presses play on a DVD. Horrified students watch...
...a Black and white 1920’s style silent movie, complete with
Dialogue Cards and dramatic PIANO MUSIC.
SERIES OF SHOTS - ON THE SCREEN
A) OBAMA speaks at a debate
B) DIALOGUE CARD: “We are the change that we seek.”
C) A FAMILY in white-face go ape-shit
D) DIALOGUE CARD: “HE’S READING OFF A TELEPROMPTER!!!!!!”
E) More intercut footage of Obama speaking with actors in
white-face reacting. Until...
F) DIALOGUE CARD: OBAMA WINS A SECOND TERM!
G) A WHITE-FACE CROWD goes nuts in the streets - scream into
camera - loot buildings and shoot themselves in the head.
26.
COCO (CONT’D)
H) Dialogue Card: “FIN”
PROFESSOR BODKIN, late 40s, with a “seen it all before”
demeanor hides a grin and lets the room settle.
PROFESSOR BODKIN
Okay. Does anyone have any comments
for Sam’s “Rebirth of a Nation?”
All of the kids are too scared to comment. Except...
PROFESSOR BODKIN (CONT’D)
Gabe, go ahead.
GABE
I dig the “silent movie” thing, but
it’s a little self-congratulatory.
Light on story and frankly
thematically dubious.
PROFESSOR BODKIN
Okay. Anybody else?
SAM
What?
SAME PLACE - MOMENTS LATER
As students filter out of the class...
PROFESSOR BODKIN
Sam?
SAM
Before you say anything might I
remind you that I sat through Birth
of A Nation, Gone With The Wind,
and Tarantino week without protest.
PROFESSOR BODKIN
And might I remind you that I read
all fifteen pages of your
unsolicited essay on why Gremlins
is actually about suburban white
fear of Black culture.
SAM
The Gremlins are loud, talk in
slang, are addicted to fried
chicken and freak out when you get
their hair wet.
27.
PRESIDENT BODKIN
My only problem with your movie is
that it was late. The silent
projects were last semester Sam.
You were supposed to have emailed
your sound treatment over Summer.
SAM
I’ve been getting footage.
PROFESSOR BODKIN
This is your senior thesis Sam,
where the hell is your head at?
SAM
I’ve got Radio, BSU, this Head of
House thing --
PROFESSOR BODKIN
-- Do you want this? Cause if not,
don’t waste my time here --
Sam pulls out the Super 8 camera from her satchel.
SAM
-- Look this thing might as well be
my right hand Professor. I was busy
this summer that’s all.
PROFESSOR BODKIN
With everything but your major?
While your peers are taking
internships, making short films...
SAM
My dad. He’s sick. Had to go home.
PROFESSOR BODKIN
If you need some time off, take it.
But if you want to make it to next
semester --
SAM
-- I do --
PROFESSOR BODKIN
-- Pull it together. This is
Manchester.
Sam wants this. It’s in her eyes as she holds her tongue.
25 EXT. MANCHESTER UNIVERSITY - DAY 25
Sam exits the theater and spots Gabe talking to some guys.
28.
SAM
Thematically dubious?
GABE
Well what was that supposed to be
about exactly?
SAM
You’re thematically dubious!
Gabe rolls his eyes and catches up with her.
SAM (CONT’D)
Since when do TA’s give critiques?
GABE
You invoke Minstrelsy for shock
value, but to what end?
SAM
To invoke the same feeling I get
when I turn on the TV and see some
so-called reality star shuck and
jive for ratings egged on by no
doubt white producers. Or the sassy
Black secretary with no backstory
or character development aside from
their skin color.
GABE
So it’s a tit for tat? *
EXT. GOODMAN MEDIA SCHOOL 2 - DAY *
SAM *
You’re honestly saying that art *
can’t be reactionary? *
GABE *
You’re reacting to a work made *
almost a hundred years ago. *
SAM *
Yes because fear of Black men being *
involved in the United States *
Government is a completely *
antiquated concept. No social *
relevance whatsoever today. *
GABE *
Frankly I just think sometimes its *
better to hold a mirror up to your *
audience than to drop an *
ideological piano over their head. *
29.
SAM *
Frankly I just think works that *
deal with the African Diaspora *
through a post-modern lens are *
outright rejected unless they’re *
handled by a white artist. *
GABE *
African Diaspora? Really? *
26 INT. DAVIS HOUSE - DAY 26
The war rages as the two continue up a fleet of stairs.
SAM
Blackface is alive and well in our
culture. Who primarily buys hip
hop? Watches Housewives of Atlanta?
The same homogenized images of
Black people over and over again?
White people Gabe.
GABE
Who goes to see Tyler Perry movies?
SAM
We’re an underfed community. None
of this changes the fact that the
vibrancy, the complexity of Black
culture has been distilled into
commodities and marketing schemes
to be bought and sold--
GABE
--to the detriment of the so called
“real thing.” Got it.
And into a room...
INT. GABE’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Gabe slams the door.
SAM
I am indistinguishable from the so
called “urban” images used to amuse
and market to white America.
GABE
And the commodification of culture
is uniquely oppressive to Black
people?
30.
Sam nods fervently as Gabe grabs and unbuttons her jeans.
GABE (CONT’D)
So when Kanye raps about Louis V
and Rolexes and Classical Art,
exactly what exploited pocket of
Black America are those references
being mined from?
Sam can’t get her shirt off fast enough.
SAM
On your knees.
Gabe kneels below frame as Sam closes her eyes in ecstacy.
CUT TO BLACK.
27A INT. GABE’S ROOM - EVENING 27A
Sam’s eyes pop open - a startled scream escapes her lips.
She’s surprised at first to see Gabe beside her in bed, the
outside spoon. They’re both naked. Her pompadour frayed.
GABE
What? You dream in “Cosby” again?
SAM
My hair was so straight. My sweater
so big. I told you about that?
Sam’s phone buzzes. Gabe grabs it and sees Reggie’s photo pop
up. He swallows his envy and hands it to Sam. She doesn’t
answer. Silence as it hits her voicemail.
GABE
Hey so...this whole “Head of House”
thing. Congrats?
SAM
Yeah, it's…it's.
GABE
Weird, right? Never took you as a
student politician...
Reggie’s photo again - New Voicemail. A regret in Sam’s eyes.
SAM
Yeah, well...
Sam rolls out of bed. Gabe thinks twice before he asks it.
31.
GABE
Sam? What are we doing?
She badly wants to give him the answer he wants. Instead...
SAM
Fucking.
28 INT. STUDIO BOOTH - DAY 28
Reggie stares at Sam with stars in his eyes as she
effortlessly addresses the campus in between bits of jazz.
SAM (V.O.)
Dear White People. Please stop
touching my hair.
29 INT. GARMIN CLUB HOUSE - DAY 29
Lionel at an ancient oak dining room table listens to the
broadcast over his laptop. Makes studious notations...
SAM (V.O.)
Does this look like a petting zoo
to you?
Lionel gets an IM: “George: Hey handsome, how’s the story?”
To which Lionel writes: “Going great sexy.” Lionel deletes
“sexy” and replaces it with “:)” before hitting send.
29A BAR DIVIDE 29A
Across from Lionel is Kurt flanked by his eager but self
conscious right hand GORDON - and MITCH, swagged out varsity
crew captain and connoisseur of all things Black culture.
They wear “PASTICHE” gear, hunch over a glowing iPad and
scroll through a series of student group photos in the
Yearbook. Kurt stares off into space, turns up the GANGSTA
RAP playing from a nearby blue tooth speaker.
Kurt pours shots of Jack which Gordon eyes with caution.
GORDON
Kurt it’s three.
MITCH
Y.O.L.O. my nigga!
Everyone takes the shot.
32.
GORDON
We don’t even have our new staff
yet. Why are we planning this?
KURT
Everyone wants to be on our staff
that’s the easy part.
MITCH
We’re going to make staff bids on
Game Night, and the RSVP’s are
through the roof for that.
KURT
Yeah but Halloween is our premiere
party. The waitlist is already a
hundred deep and it’s going to take
a lot to outdo this summer.
MITCH
Cinco de Mayo was epic.
INSERT:
A black and white photo of Kurt and crew dressed in Sombreros
and Mexican stereotypes at a wild pool party. The title
reads... PASTICHE PRESENTS “WETBACK”
GORDON
How about the Young Republicans?
KURT
Too close to the Tea-Party.
INSERT:
Photo of Kurt and crew dressed as famous female political
conservatives - brandishing rally signs with misspellings and
cups of tea. The title reads... “PASTICHE’S TEA PARTY”
MITCH
Yo we need an East vs West hip hop
party. Get the honeys in here.
GORDON
“The honeys?” You’re from Vermont.
KURT
Guys what’s the Pastiche motto?
GORDON
“Sharpen thy sword.”
33.
MITCH
Our motto is a euphemism for
masturbation?
GORDON
It’s a reminder that satire is the
weapon of reason. So who on campus
is being unreasonable?
MITCH
Sounds like a reminder of how gay
you are.
GORDON
Was that even a reasonable attempt
at a quip Mitch?
MITCH
Hey Gordon, say reasonable again.
SAM (O.S.)
Dear White People, knowing Lil’
Wayne lyrics no longer earns you an
Honorary Black Card. It just
reminds me how often you say the
word “nigga” when no one Black is
around as is required in reciting
said lyrics.
Kurt turns up his music and shoots Lionel a look, who plugs
headphones into his computer and looks down.
KURT
The hell does Sam think she is?
MITCH
Like Spike Lee and Oprah had a
pissed off baby.
Kurt shares a glance with Mitch and Gordon - they’re leaning
towards the same idea.
KURT
Could we?
GORDON
How?
Kurt turns his heat towards Lionel - has a bone to pick.
KURT
Hey Lionel. Talked to the Dean
today.
34.
(MORE)
We had a very enlightening
conversation. I just want to say...
I’m sorry about the voice message.
29B DINING ROOM 29B
Kurt and his crew cross over to Lionel’s table. Kurt unzips
his pants silently.
KURT (CONT’D)
Do you accept?
Lionel removes the headphones and turns to Kurt, just as he
starts flopping his dick around off screen. Lionel quickly
looks in the other direction. Kurt’s friends crack up.
GORDON
Please put that away.
KURT
You got to talk to these people in
a language they’ll understand.
Lionel shoves his headphones back on over his fro.
LIONEL
Pathetic.
KURT
(yelling)
Wherever he ships you off to, be
sure to pack a sense of humor with
you, kay bro?
Lionel drowns them out. He flips through Sam’s “Ebony & Ivy”
book to a section called...
SAM (V.O.)
The Paper Bag Tests.
As Lionel reads we swish pan to...
30 DREAM DINER 30
...an abstract Diner set. Sam at the counter addresses us.
SUPERIMPOSE: THE TIP TEST
SAM
The Tip Test. You hit up Jelly’s
for a snack. Your waitress mistakes
you for someone who looks like you
(Black) who once ran up a thirty
dollar bill and left a dollar tip.
35.
KURT (CONT'D)
WAITRESS, over it, crosses frame and glares coldly at us.
Lionel takes a seat at a booth with Sam across from him.
SAM (CONT’D)
You watch all the other customers
order before you do...
Waitress huffs her way over to Lionel.
LIONEL
Pastrami sandwich on rye.
SAM
...then proceed to wait no less
than forty minutes for your food.
A wall-clock advances forty, before the food and check come.
SAM (CONT’D)
How do you tip? A...
LIONEL
Forty minutes? Man she’s lucky I
leave her forty cents. You do a
good job, maybe you’ll see a tip.
SAM
B...
LIONEL
Doris was tripping, but fifteen
percent is the least I can do.
SAM
Or C...
LIONEL
I reject the stereotype that
African American’s don’t tip. I’m
leaving her twenty, no twenty five,
just to prove I can!
CUT TO:
Lionel’s back in reality. He ponders the scenario.
LIONEL (CONT’D)
C?
He turns the book upside down and reads the small print on
the bottom of the page. “A) ONE HUNDRED” “B) OOFTA” and his
answer “C) NOSE-JOB.”
36.
LIONEL (CONT’D)
Nose-job?
31 EXT. MANCHESTER UNIVERSITY - DAY 31
The campus has settled into the semester as students trudge
back and forth to class.
SAM (V.O.)
Dear White People in a shocking
reversal using the term “African
American” is borderline racist now.
32 INT. DEAN FAIRBANKS OFFICE - DAY 32
Dean Fairbanks and PRESIDENT HERBERT FLETCHER, 50’s in an
even better suit than Fairbanks listen to the radio.
Fairbanks eyeballs Fletcher - tension between the two.
SAM (O.S.)
Turns out if you’re too worried
about Political Correctness to say
“Black”, odds are you secretly just
want to call us niggers anyway and
truth be told I’d rather you just
be honest about it.
PRESIDENT FLETCHER
Free speech my ass.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
Stalin quotes for two hundred?
PRESIDENT FLETCHER
You’re joking about this?
DEAN FAIRBANKS
I’m sorry, was I supposed to take
“Free speech my ass” as a
legitimate suggestion?
PRESIDENT FLETCHER
This is your office’s issue Walter.
Especially after that episode with
Kurt in the dining hall.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
Every race issue is my issue.
PRESIDENT FLETCHER
It’s a student issue. You are the
Dean of students aren’t you?
The two share an old and heated glare.
37.
PRESIDENT FLETCHER (CONT’D)
The Times has been watching us like
a hawk. Last thing we need is some
“race war” on newspapers across the
country. How do you think our donor
base will feel about that? Our fundraiser
is four weeks away.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
How bad is this deficit of yours?
PRESIDENT FLETCHER
Worse. But let me tell you
something. If this blows up any
further? It’s on you Walter. Racism
is over in America. And if anyone’s
still dealing with it, it’s the --
I don’t know Mexicans probably.
Troy pokes his head in. Fairbanks cuts the radio off.
PRESIDENT FLETCHER (CONT’D)
Come on in.
TROY
President Fletcher.
PRESIDENT FLETCHER
Son, call me Herb.
Fairbanks grits his teeth as Fletcher exits and Troy sits.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
President Fletcher tells me his son
got his ass handed to him.
Troy hates this game.
DEAN FAIRBANKS (CONT’D)
Bout time. Can’t tell you how many
instances I had to defend Armstrong
/ Parker when I was Head of House.
TROY
Sam’s out of line. Kurt’s alright.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
But you’re supposed to be better
than alright. Since when do we lose
elections Troy?
TROY
The Housing Act passing without a
fight didn’t help.
38.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
What have I told you about excuses?
TROY
Pops my course load is full anyway.
I’m head of Econ Board, I’m
thinking about Pastiche.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
Pastiche? On Kurt Fletcher’s staff?
TROY
You know to round out the res?
DEAN FAIRBANKS
I’ll be God damned if twenty years
from now you have to end up working
for that dumb asses son.
TROY
(put in his place)
Yes sir.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
Fletcher and I graduated a year
apart. He barely made it through. I
graduated Summa cum Laude. Now look
who’s President and who’s Dean.
TROY
What’s the difference?
DEAN FAIRBANKS
A couple hundred grand a year.
Understand what I’m saying? Now
what happened between you and Sam
to make her come after you anyway?
TROY
Sofia. You remember Sofia? Daughter
of the President. Psych major. “Has
the world ahead of her Troy.”
DEAN FAIRBANKS
I don’t like your tone boy.
TROY
Sorry sir.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
So you lost the House. On to the
school presidency then.
The light in Troy’s eyes dims a bit.
39.
DEAN FAIRBANKS (CONT’D)
It’ll be good to show this campus
is capable of electing someone like
you as school president.
TROY
Someone like me?
33 INT. TROY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT 33
Troy hovers over the toilet - smokes weed while the shower
runs - exhales through his paper towel / dryer sheet
apparatus. He jots down on a notepad and LAUGHS to himself.
TROY’S APARTMENT - SAME TIME
Sofia has her face to the floor - peering underneath the
bathroom door. She can see Troy’s feet. What the hell?
Off the SQUEAK of the shower being cut Sofia jumps up.
MOMENTS LATER
Troy bounds out the bathroom in his undies. Sofia on the
couch pretends to have been watching television.
TROY
Babe. Hat or no hat?
Troy stands before her in his undies holding a Kangol. He
eyes her oversized T-shirt.
TROY (CONT’D)
Are you wearing that?
SOFIA
I don’t have to be.
Sofia yanks Troy to her by his underwear to kiss his navel.
SOFIA (CONT’D)
Hey boo...why don’t we put some of
your new found free time to good
use? It’s been a while since...
TROY
What’s with all this boo stuff?
SOFIA
...since you fucked me with your
big Black cock.
Troy pulls away.
40.
SOFIA (CONT’D)
It used to turn you on when I
talked like that. Is it me?
TROY
(yes)
I love you.
SOFIA
Is it Sam?
TROY
Can we please just, get ready?
SOFIA
Why? I hate my brother’s friends.
Troy thinks over his next words carefully.
TROY
You’re not going to go with me?
SOFIA
You’d go without me?
Troy tries to flash a charming shrug.
SOFIA (CONT’D)
You’re my guest!
Sofia gathers some books and heads for the door.
TROY
You can hang out while I’m --
SOFIA
-- Okay, what’s with you and my
brother? Are you in love with him?
Is this like, some DL shit?
Sofia storms out.
TROY
“DL shit!?”
34 INT. FOREST - NIGHT 34
Lionel walks up the darkly lit stairs of a very old building.
He reaches a door marked “Newsroom.”
35 INT. NEWSROOM - NIGHT 35
Lionel looks around the dimmed office. There is music and
light coming from a room past all the cubicles...
41.
36 INT. BULLPEN - NIGHT 36
...An office filled with computers. George and a few other
EDITORS scream with laughter - beers and pizza in hand.
GEORGE does a beat on his desk while...
GEORGE
I keeps it clean
Ya know what I mean.
I drinks my Vodka straight,
like I’m a fiend.
ANNIE, a strawberry blonde laughs in George’s lap. Lionel’s
envy shows.
ANNIE
Wait, quiet I want to hear this.
Annie turns up a Youtube video of...
COCO (O.S.)
If I could grow straight Indian
hair out my head --
ANNIE
Ohmigod, this is going on Facebook.
Annie swivels in her chair only to SCREAM BLOODY MURDER at
the sight of Lionel.
LIONEL
Relax the Negro at the door is not
here to rape you.
Annie laughs. The mood is drunk and light.
LIONEL (CONT’D)
So this is what editors do?
GEORGE
We’re taking a break, what are you
doing here?
LIONEL
You wanted me to drop in and tell
you how the story was coming?
GEORGE
Yeah like this week. It’s Saturday
night. You got nowhere else to be?
LIONEL
It was this or the new Madea movie.
42.
GEORGE
Dear God. Where does Madea go this
time? Dialysis?
37 EXT. MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT 37
Sam, flanked by Reggie and the BoFros are in mid rant.
REGGIE
Man fuck Tyler Perry.
SAM
Like, can we have a movie with, you
know characters in them? ‘Stead of
stereotypes wrapped in Christian
dogma?
REGGIE
Why is every educated person
inherently evil? Why this Nigga
gotta be in a mutha fucking dress
all the mutha fucking time?
SAM
How come the only Black movies
Hollywood wants to make are ones
with mammies in fat suits or Black
women in pain man?
All of this is directed at a TEENAGER in the box office.
TEENAGER
Most people are here to see Fang 9.
(after a beat)
Kelly Rowland’s in it?
The group throw up their hands and groan in protest.
38 INT. KURT’S HOUSE - NIGHT 38
Game Night and Kurt’s house is filled with smoke, music, and
rich kids who play cards at various tables.
Coco, in a banging jumpsuit scans the room for prospects. A
few eyes from the WHITE BOYS start to flicker her way. This
perks her up, as she arches her back slightly...
...only to see their eyes follow the WHITE BRUNETTE HIPSTER
GIRL who has entered behind her.
Coco catches herself in the mirror. What don’t they see?
38A CARD TABLE 38A
43.
Troy deals cards at a table - the game is Texas Hold Em. Troy
holds court - much to Kurt’s chagrin. The mood is playful.
There’s a brief eye contact between Troy and Coco.
39 INT. SAM’S APARTMENT - NIGHT 39
A huge “Boycott Sal’s Pizzeria” poster hangs on the walls of
Sam’s chic dorm surrounded by other street art. The BoFros
and a few cool residents of Armstrong / Parker hang about.
Underground hip hop permeates the room. Sam refuses a joint
coldly from Reggie - her eyes fixed on “SCHOOL DAZE” which
plays on her 36’ flatscreen.
SAM
How ‘bout you stop stereotyping
yourself and put that shit out?
This ain’t “Friday.”
REGGIE
Yo Sam. We got to talk about the
protest. When are we are bringing
the Housing fight to the prez?
Sungmi takes a seat next to Sam. Some kids hop up and start
grooving it out when a new song pops up on the playlist.
SUNGMI
The House voted down sponsoring the
rally.
REGGIE
What do we need it sponsored for?
SAM
Demonstrations can get shut down if
a House doesn’t sponsor them.
REGGIE
Like the House you’re head of?
Sam shoots Reggie a glare. He backs off.
SUNGMI
Hey Sam, I read “Ebony and Ivy.”
What’s with the Oofta, Nose-Jobs,
One Hundred stuff? I miss
something?
Sam smiles.
SAM
You want me to break it down?
44.
40 INT. KURT’S HOUSE - NIGHT 40
Troy deals another hand with Kurt, Mitch and Gordon. Troy’s
homeboy swag is thicker than usual.
MITCH
Yo my perfect Friday night is
whiskey and my T-Bone Walker
records, real talk.
TROY
Who the fuck is T-Bone Walker?
40A INTERCUT WITH SAM’S APARTMENT: 40A
SAM
Only a few ways colored folks
survive at a place like this.
MITCH
Uh only a pioneer of electric and
jump blues bro. Know your roots.
TROY
White folks always be on stuff like
decades too late and act like they
discovered some shit.
SAM
“Oofta” is the jazz age term for
Bojangle types who Blacked it up
for White audiences.
MITCH
Don’t sleep on T-Bone man.
TROY
Rock, Jazz, Blues - Nigga whatchu
got on right now?
MITCH
Public Enemy my Nig--
TROY
--Yo watch that man.
GORDON
You just called him --
TROY
-- Ya’ll get Country Clubs we get
to say Nigga.
Everyone at the table erupts in laughter. Except Kurt.
45.
GORDON
And golf? And all our girls?
TROY
Whatchu mean all your girls?
GORDON
Dude, between OJ, Tiger, Wesley
Snipes and uh, Troy over here...
TROY
Yo. It’s a word for that.
Reparations.
More Kurt-less laughter from the table.
TROY (CONT’D)
Forty white bitches and a mule.
Perfectly executed. Troy grins as the table erupts.
SAM
An Oofta modulates his Blackness up
or down depending on the crowd and
what he wants from them.
MITCH
Kurt?
KURT
What?
GORDON
Kurt.
Troy watches this exchange closely.
GORDON (CONT’D)
Troy. You thinking about Pastiche?
TROY
That’s the magazine right?
GORDON
For starters.
MITCH
What other “magazine” you know has
a first look deal at NBC? The third
biggest Youtube channel. Talk show.
Platinum comedy record homie!
46.
GORDON
Couldn’t you see him on the talk
show Kurt?
Kurt looks at his cards.
KURT
I fold.
41 INT. SAM’S APARTMENT - NIGHT 41
A small crowd’s formed around Sam.
SUNGMI
Okay, and a nose-job is a wannabe?
42 INT. KURT’S HOUSE - NIGHT 42
Coco finishes her drink and catches Mitch and Gordon as they
start up a Youtube video on their iPad. The previous game is
over. They watch “Dear White People - 1,378,480 views.”
42A INTERCUT WITH SAM’S APARTMENT: 42A
SAM
Sort of. Nose-jobs smooth their
Black edges and try to blend.
Coco runs her fingers through her straight hair.
GORDON
You seen this one?
SAM (YOUTUBE)
Dear White People using Instagram.
You have an iPhone and go on hikes.
I get it.
COCO
Ugh.
Gordon and Mitch turn and notice Coco. Mitch eyes her curves.
GORDON
Not a fan?
Coco makes a “no” face.
MITCH
Sup ma?
COCO
Don’t talk like that.
47.
GORDON
Hey I know you...
Coco is taken aback as Gordon punches up her video and plays
it back. She hovers over them.
COCO (YOUTUBE)
Muffins. I hate to do it, but Imma
have to get real Black with you.
Coco a bit embarrassed scans the view count.
SAM
A Nose-job’s worst fear is that
their “Blackness” might cause a
fuss or draw undue attention so
they apologize for it or use it to
self deprecate.
COCO
Forty thousand views already?
GORDON
Looks like someone submitted you to
Buzzfeed. Taking off...
Coco leans over them and scrolls down. The first comment is
from a HELMUT: “Much better...” Coco soaks this in.
MITCH
You wan’ a drink a sun’in?
COCO
Let me guess you’re from Ohio?
MITCH
Vermont.
GORDON
What do you have against Dear White
People?
Coco smiles and slyly clicks to her next video.
COCO (YOUTUBE)
Dear White People. How do I feel
about it? Well for one it’s Blacker
than thou propaganda from a bougie
Lisa Bonet wannabe who smells like
patchouli and frankly I can’t
believe we’re letting Sam get away
with it.
48.
Mitch and Gordon’s mouths are ajar. Coco studies the view
count...26,758. A pride strikes Coco.
43 INT. SAM’S APARTMENT - NIGHT 43
As the impromptu party dies down...
SUNGMI
Okay and One Hundred?
REGGIE
Keeping it One-Hundred! Being Black
as hell just cause.
Sam rolls her eyes.
SUNGMI
But what about just being you?
SAM
Like I said...
44 INT. NEWSROOM - NIGHT 44
Lionel’s got the eyes of the Bullpen on him. Annie’s really
warmed to him - her hands play with his afro.
ANNIE
You don’t mind do you?
SAM (V.O.)
There’s only a few ways a person of
a color can survive at a place like
this...
LIONEL
Of course not.
GEORGE
Alright so then what?
LIONEL
So then Sam says “What, is your
daddy scared the Negroes are gonna
start a rebellion on the
plantation?”
George goes CRAZY at this.
GEORGE
To Kurt Fletcher!?
LIONEL
Yeah. Yes. Yup.
49.
GEORGE
We’ve got a news item but there’s
something bigger here. It’s a
profile piece on Armstrong / Parker
and Sam White’s pseudo revolution.
ANNIE
What’s the headline?
LIONEL
Outdated nationalist seeks purpose
starts race war?
Lionel’s joke hits, but he feels gross for saying it.
The image of Sam shaking her head in the dinner FLASHES
before Lionel briefly.
GEORGE
Beers in the corner. Bang out the
news item tonight and we’ll work on
the profile piece for next week.
Lionel grabs a beer and takes a seat at one of the open
computers. George starts up a beat on his desk as he and
Annie stare at Lionel expectantly.
LIONEL
What are you doing?
ANNIE
All Bugle staffer must freestyle.
It’s law.
GEORGE
You want to be a staffer right?
LIONEL
(awkward)
My name is Lionel
Kind of like a lion
King of the jungle
Indigenous to Africa...
The beat has long since stopped.
LIONEL (CONT’D)
Sorry.
45 INT. KURT’S KITCHEN - NIGHT 45
Troy heads into the kitchen just as Kurt heads out.
50.
TROY
Yo man, you know I wasn’t talking
about Sof back there with whole
forty bitches thing. I was just --
KURT
-- trying to get on my staff?
TROY
I never really thought about --
KURT
-- Bullshit. Game Night is where we
make our bids for the new staff.
It’s why everyone’s here. You were
practically about to bust out a tap
dance.
TROY
I’m a Poly Sci major man. I just
came to hang out.
KURT
My staff likes you. A lot.
TROY
But you don’t.
KURT
This thing with you and Sof...
TROY
I’m good to her.
KURT
Our dad’s have been playing a game
of chess off and on since 1972.
TROY
What and Sof is the White queen?
KURT
You’re a pawn. And I think it’s
time you get off the board bro.
Troy takes this in.
KURT (CONT’D)
Here’s the deal. Every year we
throw a party. The point is to mock
the self important and moronic
entities of the campus. The way to
get staffed is to write an invite
for the party.
51.
(MORE)
Our invites are legendary, we make
Gawker, the Post, tons of blogs
every year. If your invite is the
one that goes out, you’re
guaranteed a spot on the staff. The
runners up are voted on by the rest
of us.
Troy catches eyes with Coco who gives him a seductive glance.
45A LIVING ROOM 45A
Coco turns back to her now enamored crowd. She’s in her
element with these boys at her feet.
COCO
I just think having good hair and
carrying on with a degree of
sophistication doesn’t make me a
traitor to the race.
MITCH
Want to know why they used to call
me Black Mitch?
GORDON
Absolutely not.
COCO
No one called you that.
KITCHEN
Just as Gordon, Mitch and Coco approach...
TROY
Okay. And what’s this year’s theme?
Kurt rolls his eyes instinctively.
KURT
Still working on that...
TROY
The party’s a couple weeks away.
GORDON
Yo Kurt. I want you to meet
someone.
COCO
You guys got a party coming up?
Coco smiles at Kurt, before flicking her eyes over Troy.
52.
KURT (CONT’D)
46 INT. SAM’S APARTMENT - NIGHT 46
Sungmi is one of the last to clear out of Sam’s apartment as
the party winds down.
SUNGMI
Hey, about the rally. You could
still get the permit anyway Sam and
go against the board. Most people
consider that political suicide
though.
REGGIE
We got to rally Sam. Time is now.
SAM
Use your head Reggie. You think a
rally is going to change things?
REGGIE
It’ll do a hell of a lot more than
a radio show or views on Youtube.
Everyone gets quiet. Sungmi takes this time to exit.
REGGIE (CONT’D)
Look, we got power Sam and it’s
time we used it. We earned it.
SAM
We? I didn’t see you running for
shit Reggie.
The Bofros trade looks as Reggie storms out. Sam waits a beat
and rolls her eyes.
47 EXT. ARMSTRONG / PARKER QUAD - NIGHT 47
Sam walks after Reggie.
REGGIE
Tired.
SAM
Don’t “one word” me.
REGGIE
Why you got to snap at me all the
time? I’m around you like twenty
four seven. Like your lap dog. I
don’t even usually get down like
that with no red bone chicks man.
53.
SAM
Don’t call me that.
REGGIE
Come on, I thought your ass was
Puerto Rican when I met you.
Sam turns to go.
REGGIE (CONT’D)
Oh so you can dish it out but you
can’t take it?
SAM
I’m taking my ass home.
REGGIE
Come on Sam. You know how I feel
about you.
SAM
How am I supposed to know how you
feel about me?
REGGIE
You know what? Forgive me if I see
something in you. Something
inspiring. Something folks like me
can get behind.
Reggie puts his hands on Sam’s belt and pulls her in to a
kiss as a group walks by. Over Reggie’s shoulder Sam sees...
...Gabe look back at her. He’s heartbroken. She pretends not
to be affected and sinks into a kiss from Reggie.
REGGIE (CONT’D)
Tell me you’ll set up the rally.
SAM
I’ll set up the rally.
48 INT. KURT’S KITCHEN - NIGHT 48
Kurt, Gordon, Mitch, Coco and Troy all trade glances.
GORDON
Are we sure about this?
KURT
It’s ironic. Bold. And don’t tell
me I’m the only one who thinks Sam
White’s little movement needs to
get cut down to size.
54.
Agreement Coco’s gaze. Uncertainty in Troy’s.
KURT (CONT’D)
Looks like you got your Hip Hop
party Mitch.
MITCH
‘Bout time. It’s going to be huge
man, fucking epic.
Kurt holds back a smile.
KURT
Boys, we’ve got a lot more mingling
to do. We’ll be in touch. And Troy?
Get off the board bro.
Troy chews on this as Kurt leads his group out. Troy smiles,
goes to exit.
TROY
Nice seeing you.
COCO
Where’s Sofia?
TROY
I have no idea.
COCO
Trouble in paradise?
Troy shrugs and heads to the party.
COCO (CONT’D)
Figures.
(off Troy’s
incredulousness)
Nothing. I’m sure you’ve got
something else fair and petite
and...fair lined up for that drink.
TROY
What’s that supposed to mean?
COCO
It’s fine. I’m not even really into
Black dudes anyway.
TROY
I’ll have you know I’m an equal
opportunity employer, okay?
55.
COCO
And what kind of jobs are you
hiring for mister?
Coco’s stiletto rubs the side of Troy’s calf.
TROY
Aren’t you and Sofia --
COCO
-- I’m an accessory to Sofia. Can’t
ever shake the feeling I’m an
assignment for that Afro Studies
Minor of hers.
Troy nervously glances out at the crowd and then back towards
this dangerous and tempting creature before him.
COCO (CONT’D)
I’m sure you have no idea what I
mean.
49 EXT. MANCHESTER YARD - NIGHT 49
Lionel and George walk through the campus at night. George
waves goodbye to Annie as they pass Bechet House.
LIONEL
She seems really cool.
George just smiles.
GEORGE
Did we go too far? You’re in
Armstrong/Parker right?
LIONEL
No. Garmin.
GEORGE
Fancy.
LIONEL
George I’m not exactly down with
Sam and I’m not in the BSU. I got
kicked out of Armstrong / Parker
same as Kurt. But I’m going to
write a good story, okay?
GEORGE
I hope so. I want a Bugle on your
chest by the end of the month.
Lionel fights a smile as his heart beats through his chest.
56.
They reach the front of Lionel’s house. George runs his hand
through Lionel’s hair. Mitch, smoking on the porch with some
other kids - trade glances.
GEORGE (CONT’D)
Your fro’s so gnarly.
LIONEL
I’m growing it out.
GEORGE
Night Lionel.
Lionel heads up his stoop - past the snickers and glares of
Mitch and company.
MITCH
Party’s not over.
LIONEL
I live here.
MITCH
Sorry bro. Invitation only.
LIONEL
It’s two in the morning.
Mitch shrugs as humiliation floods over Lionel.
Lionel sighs and slumps on the steps outside the door. He
scrolls through his phone for a contact...OFFICE OF THE DEAN.
Starts an email.
50 INT. TROY’S BEDROOM - MORNING 50
Troy’s Kangol sits in the ground, besides his undies, and
besides a bright pink thong.
Coco’s pink painted finger nails travel through the creases
of Troy’s immaculate abs.
TROY
Coco huh?
COCO
Colandrea doesn’t exactly pass the
resume test, you know? I mean
couldn’t you fucking die? My
parents should’ve just named me
Ghetto-ass-hoodrat-anisha. Do
you...indulge?
Coco fiddles in her purse - pulls out a joint.
57.
TROY
It’s ten am.
Coco lights it and takes a drag. She hands it to Troy.
TROY (CONT’D)
I don’t mess with that stuff.
Coco sees right through him as Troy hits it like a pro.
COCO
Sure about that?
TROY
Sure you don’t like Black guys?
COCO
Girl like me is just a placeholder
for ya’ll at a place like this.
TROY
I’m not like that.
COCO
I don’t think Sam would agree.
TROY
That was different.
COCO
No it wasn’t. Poor thing, she was
light skin-ded and everything.
TROY
Yo, it wasn’t like that alright?
Troy’s tone sobers Coco a bit. She places a hand on Troy’s.
TROY (CONT’D)
My pops. He wanted me with
Fletcher’s daughter. They’ve been
in competition ever since they went
here. Pops hates that Fletcher
ended up President and he got stuck
as the Dean.
COCO
So your upbringing may have
actually fucked you up more than
mine? That’s hot.
Troy laughs and takes the joint back.
58.
COCO (CONT’D)
The hell is the difference between
a Dean and a President anyway?
TROY
Apparently four hundred years of
unreconciled oppression.
COCO
He’s not going to like you running
with the Pastiche boys is he?
TROY
If I even get tapped.
COCO
You will. And you should do it.
They all land somewhere big, some
before they even graduate. I’ve
seen you in front of a crowd Troy.
I bet you could be famous.
TROY
That what you want? To be famous?
COCO
I want people to know my name.
TROY
Which one?
Coco’s phone buzzes with a message. It’s Kurt.
COCO
(reading)
We want you. Come by Ellington
tomorrow at eight.
(to Troy)
Anything?
Troy checks his phone. Nothing. A decision weighs in Troy’s
eyes as Coco throws on a shirt and gets up to go.
COCO (CONT’D)
You’re going to have to stand up to
him sooner or later Troy.
52 EXT. ARMSTRONG / PARKER QUAD - DAY 52
Troy and Sofia stand still amidst the bustle. Devastation
marks her pretty face.
SOFIA
You said you loved me.
59.
TROY
I like you a lot.
Salt meet wound. She wants to go, but something nags at her.
SOFIA
What do you do in the bathroom?
When you leave the shower running?
Was it just to get away from me?
Troy wagers his answer and decides to confess.
TROY
I smoke weed and write jokes.
Puzzled by the man before her and too hurt for more, Sofia
just turns and walks away. Troy watches her go just as...
...Lionel passes by. The two share an awkward glance before
Troy turns to enter the house.
53 INT. ARMSTRONG / PARKER HALL - SAME TIME 53
Lionel shyly trudges down the hall of Armstrong / Parker. He
turns to see Troy behind him. The two avoid the other’s gaze.
As they both head up the stairs, Troy notes it strange that
they’re headed in the same direction.
53A UPSTAIRS 53A
Lionel heads to a door at the end of the hallway and opens it
with a key. Troy’s already at the door when he looks up and
realizes Lionel’s just entered his apartment.
54 INT. TROY’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 54
TROY
The hell are you doing?
LIONEL & TROY
This is my apartment.
TROY
The hell it is.
LIONEL
The Dean said it was the only
opening.
TROY
Head of House doesn’t share.
60.
LIONEL
But you’re not Head of House.
Still stings. Troy heads into his room and closes the door
leaving Lionel alone in the living room.
57 INT. ARMSTRONG/PARKER DINING HALL - DAY 57
Lionel sits alone in front of another bowl of soup. Eyes the
different cliques of mostly Black students. Dreads walks past
and shoots a head nod. Lionel uncomfortably shoots one back.
DREADS
Stay Black, my brother.
LIONEL
Sure thing?
Lionel watches as Kurt and Troy walk together towards the
entrance - suddenly chums. Troy’s getting good news and
gladly shakes Kurt’s hand.
KURT
Need your submission by Thursday.
TROY
You got it bro.
The two try and enter, when immediately Dreads slams a GONG
in the back of the hall - prompting the whole of the dining
hall to turn and throw paper balls at Kurt.
KURT
The fuck?
Sam grins from a table comprised of Martin, Sungmi and her
other support staff. Martin is visibly annoyed.
TROY
Yo!
Troy takes some of the brunt of this and walks with the
humiliated Kurt back out of the Dining Hall.
Lionel watches with a smirk as Troy talks Kurt down on the
other side of the entrance. Lionel catches eyes with Sam
briefly who shares the same smirk.
He realizes Sam’s actually looking at Reggie, perched behind
him at a table flanked by Curls and Dreads. They address him.
REGGIE
Finally made it in.
61.
DREADS
Been moved around a lot right?
CURLS
You must have been terrified when
you saw “Armstrong/Parker” written
on your moving assignment.
LIONEL
I was just finishing up.
REGGIE
Do Black people scare you?
LIONEL
(realizing its true)
No.
REGGIE
You’re too scared to even ask
anyone for a cut.
LIONEL
I’m growing it out.
DREADS
No. I’m growing it out. You’re
fostering an ecosystem.
REGGIE
How come you don’t come to BSU?
LIONEL
I listen to Mumford and Sons and
watch Robert Altman movies. You
honestly think I’m Black enough for
the union?
DREADS
Yo, I love Robert Altman. Mutha
fucka goes in.
CURLS
(after a beat)
We’re not all homophobes you know.
Black folks?
Lionel’s eyes dart around. How did she know?
DREADS
I’m bumping Frank Ocean right now.
I don’t give a fuck. Imma still eat
at Chik Fil A though. Them nuggets
good as hell.
62.
LIONEL
I’m late for class.
REGGIE
You’re the “Black voice” of the
Bugle now. We’re just trying to
decide if you are friend or foe.
Reggie pulls a folded copy of the Bugle from under his arm.
Sam’s on the front page with the headline “WHITE STUDENTS
TOLD TO ‘GET OUT’ BY LIONEL HIGGINS.”
REGGIE (CONT’D)
We got to protect our girl.
Reggie motions over to a stressed out Sam as she argues over
something with Martin at another table.
LIONEL
I’m not on staff. Not until I make
good on my assignment, I’m just --
REGGIE
-- Assignment? What’s the story?
LIONEL
They want me to do a profile piece
on Black culture at Manchester.
REGGIE
Of which you are so clearly an
expert.
Shame floods Lionel’s face.
REGGIE (CONT’D)
So what’s harder man? Being Black
enough for the Black kids or the
white ones?
LIONEL
Being neither.
Another GONG sounds with another shower of paper balls. This
time it’s for...
...Gabe, who’s stuck outside. He makes eye contact with...
GABE
Sam! Really Sam?
She just looks away. Reggie eyes him coolly.
63.
58 INT. CLASSROOM - DAY 58
Professor Bodkin watches over a small class as the students
fill in essay questions. Sam’s eyes are glued to a window...
Outside below the Brofros pull up in an SUV. They hop out and
start pulling out rally signs and bullhorns.
Sam’s eyes dart back to the clock as Gabe watches her watch
the time.
59A EXT. MANCHESTER UNIVERSITY - DAY 59A
Sam bounds out of a building on her way to the parking lot.
From behind her...
DEAN FAIRBANKS
Running late.
Sam pauses and turns to see him.
DEAN FAIRBANKS (CONT’D)
For your little rally?
SAM
Forget your sign Dean?
DEAN FAIRBANKS
Do you honestly think this is in
the spirit of Armstrong / Parker
house?
SAM
The role of the counter culture is
to wake up the mainstream to --
DEAN FAIRBANKS
-- I’ve got furniture older than
you. Counter culture? Is that what
you think this is? That show of
yours?
SAM
What about my show?
DEAN FAIRBANKS
Your show is racist.
SAM
Black people can’t be racist.
The Dean is rendered speechless at this statement.
64.
SAM (CONT’D)
Prejudice? Yes. But not racist.
Racism describes a system of
disadvantage based on race. Black
people can’t be racist since they
don’t benefit from such a system.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
Do you read the school papers?
SAM
Is the New York Times a school
paper?
DEAN FAIRBANKS
Your antics are making press Sam
and press like this keeps men like
President Fletcher up at night.
SAM
Warm milk?
DEAN FAIRBANKS
He’s building a file on you.
SAM
It’s not my fault your son couldn’t
beat me in an election.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
I’m sure it was hard growing up.
Wondering which side you fit into.
Feeling like you have to
overcompensate perhaps?
SAM
If that’s true, I’m not the only
one Dean.
Sam walks off in a half jog - Fairbank’s last words resonate
more than she’d like.
Gabe, making his way outside just catches her exit.
59B EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY 59B
Huge canvas signs with the words “WHITES ONLY” are strewn
about the pavement, along with bullhorns and picket signs.
Sam takes these in while the Brofros feverishly unpack the
SUV.
65.
REGGIE
There you are! We supposed to start
at noon.
SAM
I told you I had class.
There’s a vibration in Sam’s pocket. Her phone says “MOM.”
She cuts it off and picks up a “white’s only” sign.
REGGIE
Those are going up on Gillespie.
Good right?
Sam shrugs in the affirmative but it’s too much. Reggie sees
a doubt in her eyes.
REGGIE (CONT’D)
Yo. What’s that? You’re not getting
cold feet are you?
SAM
No. I mean how long do I have to
talk anyway?
REGGIE
You’re kidding right? You’re sort
of the keynote.
SAM
Yeah but...you know I think the
whole Malcolm X thing is your lane
Reg. I’m just not --
REGGIE
-- They came to hear you Sam. Grab
a bullhorn. Turn it on.
Sam is struck by the command. Stuck between wanting to curse
and comply another buzz in her pocket yanks her attention to
her phone. Sam checks: “IT’S ABOUT DAD. CALL ME”
Sam turns for some privacy. She makes eye contact with Gabe
who’s just happened upon the parking lot.
GABE
What is all this?
SAM
(on phone)
Hey. In the middle of--
-- Okay. Okay. Okay.
66.
Tears well up in Sam’s eyes as she shakes her head no and
heads away from the parking lot and passed Gabe.
When Reggie looks up and catches eyes with Sam. His tilted
look of indignation asks her what she’s doing.
REGGIE
Sam?
Sam takes in the scene and decisively turns to go. Reggie’s
heart sinks as a bewildered Gabe goes to chase after her.
REGGIE (CONT’D)
Sam!
60 INT. ARMSTRONG / PARKER HALL - DAY 60
Reggie flanked by the BoFros bangs on Sam’s door.
REGGIE
Yo, what the hell Sam?
61 INT. SAM’S ROOM - DAY 61
The banging continues as Sam sits on the edge of her bed. The
tears have dried. Gabe paces behind the bed.
GABE
You want me to tell them to go?
SAM
You’re so tough.
GABE
I will.
SAM
I want you to wait until they’ve
gone and then head home.
GABE
I’m trying to be here for you.
SAM
Can you be somewhere else for me?
61A HALLWAY 61A
REGGIE
Sam! I know you’re home.
67.
61B SAM’S ROOM 61B
GABE
What do you see in him?
SAM
The only eligible single brother on
campus.
GABE
Wow. Okay.
SAM
I get it. Your parents owned in
Harlem or something? You watched
“Do The Right Thing” in high school
and you want to prove to the world
you’re down?
GABE
I want to be down? How long does it
take to get your hair like that?
REGGIE (O.S.)
Sam. We want to talk.
SAM
Reggie I will call you later damn!
(to Gabe)
You don’t know what you’re talking
about. Girls like me--
GABE
--what? Have to pick a side? I’m
sick of your tragic Mulatto
bullshit Sam!
SAM
You can’t say Mulatto.
GABE
Mulatto! Mulatto! Mulatto!
MORE BANGING
SAM
Window. Go out the window.
GABE
I’m sorry if I can’t be your Nubian
prince on my Black horse ready to
take you back to fucking Zamunda!
68.
SAM
That’s not a real African country.
GABE
Can I please get some credit for a
solid “Coming to America”
reference?
Sam tries not laugh at this.
GABE (CONT’D)
This isn’t you Sam.
SAM
No? And who am I?
GABE
You’re this...girl...
SAM
Perceptive.
GABE
Who...likes to argue with me about
every fucking thing. And I hate it
because we both know you’re smarter
than me. Your favorite director is
Bergman, but you tell people its
Spike Lee. You love bebop, but
you’ve got a thing for Taylor
Swift. I know because my Mac picks
up your Mac’s library.
SAM
And I was so careful...
GABE
You like to use phrases from the
thirties and wear clothes from the
fifties and hairstyles from the
sixties. You like to watch me when
you think I’m sleeping. And trace
the outlines of my face.
Sam fights any signs of this moving her. Another BANG.
GABE (CONT’D)
You’re more “Banksy” than “Barack”
but you’ve been co-opted as some
sort of revolutionary leader or
something? But really you’re an
anarchist. A beautiful writer,
artist, filmmaker, shit starter.
And beautiful, in general.
69.
Sam’s heart beats through her chest. Her phone rings: “Mom.”
SAM
Yeah? Yeah? Yeah. It’s okay. Get
some sleep.
Sam hangs up. A silence hangs - followed by a loud EXHALE
from Sam as she let’s go of the tension she’d been holding.
GABE
Everything okay?
SAM
(happy tears)
His condition’s stable.
GABE
Good. That’s good Sam.
Gabe goes to exit just as Reggie BANGS again.
SAM
Gabe!
Gabe opens the door to the very shocked Bofros and Reggie...
GABE
What!?
...and brushes right past them. Sam gets up and stares down
the heartbroken looks on her disciples’ faces.
SAM
I’m sorry.
And with that she closes the door right on Reggie.
62 EXT. ELLINGTON TERRACE - NIGHT 62
Coco and Helmut look out over the campus from the glowing
terrace atop the Library. They sip on coffee’s.
HELMUT
New videos are picking up steam.
COCO
Told you I was good TV.
HELMUT
The show I’m scouting for... It’s
called Black Face / White Place.
It’s reality. Like a “True Life.”
Each episode centers on a different
one of “us” in a sea of “them.”
70.
COCO
Interesting.
HELMUT
Interesting? You think they want
interesting? Dignified stories of
triumph and survival?
(off Coco’s naive shrug)
They want the “authentic urban
experience” which is basically
network talk for bitching and weave
snatching. I’m telling you this
because the network is looking to
take one of the subjects to series.
I got one episode. One shot to find
that subject. So if we do this...
COCO
...we do it all the way. I’m
guessing Sam turned you down.
HELMUT
I think so. She called me a
Bojangling Oofta, whatever that
means. Everything else she said
would’ve been bleeped on tv.
(off Coco’s laugh)
So look, forty thousand hits on
Youtube is good. It’s not great.
COCO
I’m about to get a whole lot more.
63 INT. KURT’S HOUSE - DAY 63
Coco sits before a video camera. The room is dim.
KURT
We don’t have anyone like you on
staff and you had a great idea. We
brought you here to --
COCO
-- I want to MC it. Your party.
KURT
We’re here to tell you what we
want.
COCO
You want me and in order to get me,
you have to let me MC.
71.
(MORE)
And I want to do a live video blog
from my Youtube account.
BACK TO:
64 EXT. ELLINGTON TERRACE - DAY 64
HELMUT
They’d let you do that?
COCO
They got no choice. They need me --
BACK TO:
65 INT. KURT’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 65
COCO
-- cause without me ya’ll look like
a bunch of privileged assholes.
KURT
We don’t let people video blog our
events...
COCO
...You got a week to put this thing
together boo boo. What’s it going
to be?
CUT TO:
66 EXT. ELLINGTON TERRACE - DAY 66
Helmut looks at Coco with a shocked gleam in his eye.
COCO
You look surprised.
HELMUT
It’s just...
67 INT. TROY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT 67
Troy and Lionel both type furiously at their computers in
their rooms. Troy on his invite - Lionel on his article. They
each look at the other in alternate intervals.
HELMUT (V.O.)
...not everyone is as camera ready
as you.
67A LIONEL'S ROOM 67A
72.
COCO (CONT'D)
Lionel pauses the episode of STAR TREK THE NEXT GENERATION on
his TV and heads to...
67B KITCHEN 67B
...bar divide. Pours a bowl of cereal. He glances into Troy’s
room. He’s also got Star Trek on. Could it be? Troy, feels
Lionel’s eyes on him and quickly switches it to Basketball.
67C TROY’S ROOM 67C
Troy types in “KURT FLETCHER” in the “To” field and “PASTICHE
SUBMISSION” in the subject field. He hits “send” and swallows
the lump in his throat.
68 INT. DEANS OFFICE - DAY 68
Troy gingerly enters into the Dean’s office. Martin and Dean
Fairbanks talk in hushed tones around Fairbanks' desk.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
Martin, would you share with Troy
what you shared with me?
MARTIN
The server that processes the
voting results for House Elections
has shut down the A.P. database.
Saw it this morning. Apparently the
intermediary program is on a
refractile loop.
TROY
I’m a Poly Sci major man.
MARTIN
Sam currently has 445 votes. That’s
200 more than she had last week
during the actual election.
TROY
There’s not even that many
residents in Armstrong / Parker.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
She cheated. Hacked the system.
69 INT. PRESIDENT’S OFFICE - DAY 69
Sam sits before a giant fireplace - twice as large as the
Dean’s. She faces President Fletcher and fights nerves.
73.
SAM
I wouldn’t even begin to know how
to do something like that.
PRESIDENT FLETCHER
Is your little war really this
important?
Sam shifts gears slightly - he wants something from her.
PRESIDENT FLETCHER (CONT’D)
I understand the pressure to stand
for something at an institution
like this but you’re barking up the
wrong tree okay?
70 INT. DEAN’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 70
MARTIN
Had to have been Reggie. Dude’s in
my programing class. Good. Just
forgot to turn his program off.
TROY
Wow.
MARTIN
You’re the rightful Head of House.
TROY
(shit)
So great.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
Martin, let me talk to Troy for a
bit. I appreciate this.
71 INT. PRESIDENT’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 71
Sam glares at Fletcher.
PRESIDENT FLETCHER
Your advisor tells me you’re
hanging on by a thread in you
major. Perhaps it’s time to
reprioritize.
SAM
You’re trying to frighten me, but I
think you’re the one who’s scared.
74.
PRESIDENT FLETCHER
And I think you long for the days
where Blacks were hanging from
trees and denied actual rights.
Then you’d actually have something
to fight against.
A swell of emotion behind Sam’s steel eyes.
PRESIDENT FLETCHER (CONT’D)
You will be facing two hearings in
the coming weeks that could end in
either Probation or Suspension. One
on the merits of your show, the
other on your election to Head of
House.
Sam is truly scared by this.
PRESIDENT FLETCHER (CONT’D)
Your responsibilities to your house
are suspended. Your show is done
for. And another one of your
illegal “demonstrations” will only
make matters worse. This is a
critical time for this school.
SAM
You damn right it is.
PRESIDENT FLETCHER
We don’t have an intolerance
problem here. Except for the one
I’m looking at.
72 INT. DEAN’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 72
Troy and his father are alone.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
You didn’t tell me you and Sofia
had a misunderstanding.
TROY
Who did?
DEAN FAIRBANKS
Her father. She was very upset.
(off Troy’s silence)
Troy. What sort of vision do you
have for yourself?
75.
TROY
Get my degree. Then Law School and
then --
DEAN FAIRBANKS
--And what’s that got to do with
partying with Kurt? With smoking
weed and writing jokes?
Panic flashes over Troy.
DEAN FAIRBANKS (CONT’D)
Okay, so what? Is it the spotlight
Kurt gets? You want to be on...tv
or something? You know how many
Black men waste their lives to get
on TV? Be rappers and ball players?
TROY
(wanting it to be true)
Dad no. I want what we always
talked about. Maybe have my own
firm someday? Run for office. Make
a difference. Wife. Kids. I want
all that. I really really do.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
And the drugs? God damn it Troy I
taught you better than this. I have
been in academia a long time, I’ve
seen a lot of things. The men who
really run this world? You got no
idea what they see when they see
you. You are not going to be what
they all think you are. You will
not give them that satisfaction,
you hear me?
TROY
Yes sir.
73 INT. PRESIDENT’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 73
Sam steps out of Fletcher’s office into the waiting room.
Kurt is there. He stands and the two silently stare the other
down as Kurt enters his father’s office.
A SECRETARY picks up a ringing phone - prompts her to exit
the room. Sam watches her sign for a delivery outside through
the window.
Sam slips behind the office door - quietly pushes it open and
listens in.
76.
PRESIDENT FLETCHER
I know about the party. You picked
a hell of a time.
KURT
What party --
PRESIDENT FLETCHER
-- You’re cancelling Kurt. End of
story.
75 INT. BULLPEN - DAY 75
Lionel walks through the empty office - slows down as he over
hears...
GEORGE (O.S.)
Lionel’s story on the would-be
protest outside of Gillespie is
running tomorrow and I’m also
having Lionel work on a profile
piece of Armstrong/Parker like you
suggested. Really break down what’s
going on.
Lionel gingerly approaches the door to see George finish up a
phone call.
GEORGE (CONT’D)
Right. It’s almost like they
recycle so much from their past -
Music, food, fashion, and now
turbulence.
This leaves a bitter taste in Lionel’s mouth.
GEORGE (CONT’D)
Thank you so much. Okay, take care.
George can’t fight his grin as he looks to Annie.
ANNIE
Well?
GEORGE
That was our Times advisor. He said
it’s stories like these that get
editors recommendation letters.
Lionel knocks on the door. Annie and George are startled but
reassured when they see who it is.
77.
LIONEL
The Negro at the door didn’t scare
you this time.
Annie smiles and heads for the door.
ANNIE
Lionel please. You’re only
technically Black. G, going to
French. You want me to hold your
seat?
GEORGE
Thanks.
Annie smiles and walks out.
LIONEL
You need something? Saw your email.
GEORGE
Yeah, I need someone to do the
Donor’s function on Saturday. Small
dinner for the school’s big givers.
Administration wants a little
coverage.
LIONEL
That’s Halloween night.
GEORGE
Right, which is why no one else
will take it.
LIONEL
Ah. Thus the new guy.
George gathers his backpack and walks over to Lionel. Gets
close.
GEORGE
On my way to class, but you can
stay and check out last year’s
piece. You’ll do fine.
LIONEL
I don’t know. Are there going to be
any racially fueled outbursts at
this thing?
GEORGE
Never know right?
78.
It’s clear Lionel wants to say something else. George too.
LIONEL
Am I a good writer?
GEORGE
You’ll get better. And we need you
right now.
LIONEL
You’re just a big recommendation
away from landing the Times.
GEORGE
God I hope so.
Lionel looks down. He is being used. Turns to go, just as --
GEORGE (CONT’D)
Hey.
-- George grabs Lionel unsure what he wants to say. So
instead he just kisses him.
GEORGE (CONT’D)
I’m glad we finally got that Bugle
on your chest.
Lionel’s all mixed up.
GEORGE (CONT’D)
There’s a big party the night of
the Donor’s event. Call me after,
maybe we can hang?
LIONEL
Yeah. Sounds good.
George heads out - leaving Lionel perplexed.
76 INT. TROY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT 76
Troy stares at his reflection in a mirror as he lifts his durag
to reveal his perfectly curled finger waves. He’s getting
ready for something.
His phone buzzes with a notification: “Message from:
PASTICHE”
Troy nervously clicks it open. As he reads...
79.
KURT (V.O.)
Dear White People. Are you tired of
your hum drum, Wonderbread
existence of accidental racism and
wishing you could sip on Henny out
yo crunk cup without a Bitch giving
you the side-eye? Course you are.
MONTAGE:
As our subjects get ready for their evening.
Troy goes back to combing over his finger waves, finding and
correcting imperceptible imperfections.
KURT (V.O.)
For all those looking to unleash
their inner Negro from years of
bondage and oppression Pastiche
proudly presents “Dear White
People” our 89th annual Hallow’s
Eve Costume Party - tonight at 10
Pacific Time or 5 Colored People
Time. Sorry for the short notice,
but let’s keep it one hun-ed.
You’ve had us on your calendar for
weeks.
76A Lionel stares into a mirror in an ill fitting suit 76A
combing out his unwieldy fro. He flinches in pain as he
fluffs out each section.
KURT (V.O.)
Dudes must rock FUBU, Ecko,
Rocawear, or Sean John. XXXL is the
smallest size T-Shirt you can wear,
preferably with a collage of Barack
Obama and Tupac on it. Stunner
Shades, chains, and Blue-Tooth
devices sticking out yo ears are
also encouraged.
76B Coco pulls a blonde curly wig over her natural hair. She 76B
smooths her tendrils to frame her face, almost pale with
foundation. She begins on her eyes.
KURT (V.O.)
Ladies, we need to see huge hoop
earrings, long nails, and cheap
tight clothes.
80.
(MORE)
A proper hood rat starts fights,
speaks loudly, and when she can’t
think of the word she’s trying to
say just makes one up, such as
“edumicated.” Feel free to fry up
some chicken, bring Kool-Aid,
Watermelon, 40s, Henny, and of
course Dat Purple Drank. No bougie
bitches allowed.
76C Sam removes the pins and the black power Afro pic holding 76C
up her pompadour fro hair-do, and lets it fall flat around
her ears. She takes in her image in the mirror.
KURT (V.O.)
Naturally there will be a freestyle
rap competition so bring it, get yo
shine on and join us for the party
of the year! Oh and Nigga Nigga
Nigga Nigga. Boy that felt good.
77 EXT. GILLESPIE HALL - NIGHT 77
Laughter and music from the well to do event wafts outside
while Troy dressed in a slick Armani tux hangs by the
entrance. He smokes on Coco’s one-hitter from before.
Lionel steps out in his ill fitted suit, a camera in hand.
The two are surprised to see each other.
LIONEL
Funny seeing you here.
TROY
Father likes to show me off at all
the Donor functions. The dessert
course is usually my cue to take a
breather while they talk shop.
(friendlier)
The trick is to dazzle them into
forking over their estates just
before they kick the bucket.
Lionel could just leave. Instead he accepts the olive branch.
LIONEL
So...Picard or Kirk?
TROY
Kirk. Wait...
LIONEL
I saw you watching Star --
81.
KURT (V.O.) (CONT'D)
TROY
-- Yo what happens in the crib
stays in the crib. Not trying to
get my card revoked.
LIONEL
Hey, some could argue that a show
with Whoopi Goldberg, Michael Dorn
and Kunta Kinte himself is a pretty
Black show.
TROY
Yeah? That work out for you?
LIONEL
No. No it did not. At least not in
High School. I bet there’s a statue
of you at your High School.
TROY
I was beloved. Won’t lie.
LIONEL
Did they know you were a trekker?
TROY
My pops left a paint by numbers
template for success at that High
School. All I had to do was fill in
the blanks. Football captain.
Valedictorian. Prom King.
Lionel sees a sadness in Troy.
TROY (CONT’D)
So what? You’re growing that out?
LIONEL
I think it’s gaining sentience.
TROY
It’s...out there.
LIONEL
It’s like a black hole for white
people’s fingers. They’re obsessed.
TROY
You know I cut hair. Why didn’t you
ask me?
LIONEL
You’re I dunno...you?
82.
Behind Lionel, George and Annie pass by the steps to
Gillespie.
GEORGE
Li! You ready man?
LIONEL
No costumes? I got a tux for this.
ANNIE
We just got out of the staff room.
GEORGE
Yeah, we’re going as overworked.
LIONEL
Where is it?
ANNIE
Garmin House. On third I think?
LIONEL
Third and Basin. I know it.
Before Lionel jets to join them.
TROY
Yo man. If I’d gone to your High
School, I’d have had your back.
Lionel smiles and heads after his new friends.
78 EXT. KURT’S HOUSE - NIGHT 78
Lionel pauses before his old home - now filled with the chaos
of a wild party. Lionel clears his throat and heads in.
79 INT. KURT’S HOUSE - NIGHT 79
The party is dark and rambunctious. Lots of white kids in
costume. Some as fairies or ninjas or Spiderman - but most as
pimps and thugs. As Blaxploitation characters. As Barack
Obama and Condi Rice. As Shaft, Ice Cube, and 2 Chainz.
It’s a lot for Lionel. Cups are handed to them filled with
“Purple Drank.” Everyone downs the stuff.
INT. GILLESPIE HALL - NIGHT
Troy is being appreciated by an ancient COUPLE.
TROY
...my own firm. Maybe run for
office. Make a difference you know?
83.
The couple smile. A buzz draws Troy’s eyes to his phone -
photos from “Dear White People” pop up in his news feed.
80 INT. KURT’S HOUSE - NIGHT 80
Lionel watches as Gordon and other Pastiche crew nervously
put up flyers and posters. They seem caught off guard. Lionel
glances at the posters - it’s Kurt with a large Afro wig
mimicking Sam’s “Missing Black Culture” flyers.
LIONEL
This is kind of fucked up. Right?
GEORGE
Pastiche. The world’s most erudite
boneheads. Who wants another round?
Come on Lionel, help a brother out.
LIONEL
Kitchen’s this way.
80A ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS 80A
Coco enters the party - blinged out like Nicki Minaj. She’s
feeling herself as she’s handed a drink.
She’s got eyes on her - for the first time like this at a
party. But she sees the same thing Lionel saw.
Her confidence starts to fight a shame that creeps up beneath
her party face. She switches her iPhone to video mode...
COCO
Hey there muffins. How do I look?
Why are white folks so obsessed
with being Black? And why are Black
folks so addicted to Blonde Barbie
doll weaves? Honeys it’s a strange
symbiosis we’re here to explore...
Coco’s voice cracks as she stares into her own image on her
iPhone. She pauses it and takes a breath.
80B HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 80B
Lionel leads George through the dense crowd towards the
kitchen - George pulls Lionel into a hallway and into...
80C BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS 80C
...the bathroom and up against the door. George inhales
Lionel’s lips. Runs his fingers through Lionel’s hair.
84.
LIONEL
Ouch.
GEORGE
Sorry.
LIONEL
It’s okay. Can’t wait to cut all
this off.
GEORGE
Don’t you dare.
George plunges his fingers into Lionel’s fro once again.
Pulls a touch too hard.
GEORGE (CONT’D)
I could eat you like a Hershey’s.
This sets something off in Lionel.
LIONEL
I’ll be right back.
Lionel breaks George’s grasp and heads out the bathroom...
LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
...and back out into the party. He’s trapped in a nightmare
of caricatures and reveling students. Can’t breathe.
EXT. KURT’S HOUSE - NIGHT
Lionel squeezes his way outside. Something goes off in his
head as he starts walking away from the party.
Just then Kurt arrives in front of the house with some
friends. Looks at Lionel then at the house.
KURT
What the hell?
81 INT. ARMSTRONG / PARKER - NIGHT 81
Lionel paces the halls. His mind churns as he passes the
dining hall. Sam and Reggie are engaged in something intense.
DINING HALL
SAM
For a genius dude you’re a fucking
idiot.
85.
REGGIE
I did it, we did it for you.
SAM
I didn’t ask for it Reggie. I look
like I betrayed this house.
REGGIE
Yeah? Well you betrayed me.
Sam gets up and storms out - brushes past Lionel.
LIONEL
Sam? Can we talk?
Sam turns back around fiercely.
82 INT. KURT’S HOUSE - NIGHT 82
A turntable is uncovered and rolled out - as a DUDE DRESSED
LIKE SERENA WILLIAMS starts up a MYSTIKAL record.
The crowd starts to get live now.
Coco continues to make her way through the party - her face
visibly perturbed by the time she reaches the kitchen. She
continues out back...
83 EXT. KURT’S BACKYARD - NIGHT 83
...and sits pulling out a cigarette. She sees Annie put on a
long straight Black wig and brag to friends...
ANNIE
Hey who am I? “Bitch it’s weave.
Noun. Present tense ho!”
Right in the gut. She’s playing Coco. Coco grabs her phone...
84 INT. KURT’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 84
Kurt stumbles about the party in a daze. Drunk? Folks give
him props while he searches for and spots Gordon with the
others. His phone rings.
KURT
Yeah?
INTERCUT
COCO
Kurt, it’s me. I can’t do this.
86.
KURT
Okay, I’m fucking confused.
85 INT. SAM’S ROOM - NIGHT 85
Lionel sits across from Sam.
SAM
What do you want me to do? Go over
there and yell at them?
LIONEL
Have you heard you yelling?
SAM
This house is filled with folks
willing to take up after a cause
Lionel. Believe me. Never would
have guessed you’d be one of them
but...
LIONEL
For the first time in my life, I
can’t just sit around and do
nothing. How can you?
SAM
If I’m caught being a part of
anything like this...it wouldn’t be
good for me right now okay?
Lionel gets up and walks towards the door.
SAM (CONT’D)
I’m done being everybody’s angry
Black chick.
Sam looks down as Lionel gets up and heads out.
Sam’s focus shifts to her Super 8 resting by the door and
then to a bullhorn directly across from it. Her mind ticks.
86 INT. ARMSTRONG / PARKER HALL - NIGHT 86
Lionel exits and paces down the hall. He walks by the dining
room - taken over by Reggie, the BoFros, and a mix of other
students mostly from ARMSTRONG / PARKER.
86A DINING HALL - CONTINUOUS 86A
Lionel gingerly walks in the room. He’s still an outsider
here - but something’s changed in him.
87.
LIONEL
Hey. How’s it going. Hi.
No one answers him - just stay to their own conversations.
Lionel spots a familiar face...Sungmi.
LIONEL (CONT’D)
Hey...what is this?
SUNGMI
Black Student Union.
Lionel smiles shyly. He should’ve known that.
Reggie, Curls, Dreads and the Bofros hang out at the front.
DREADS
Your call then man.
REGGIE
(to everyone)
Alright ya’ll - thanks for coming
out tonight. Looks like Sam’s not
making it so...let’s just call it.
The crowd starts to talk amongst themselves, get up and
leave. Just then Lionel stands and before he can think...
LIONEL
Uh. Excuse me. Hi. I’m Lionel. Some
of you...none of you probably know
me. I’ve never been to a meeting.
But I just came back from a party
on campus and I think you should
know about it.
Lionel’s nerves can be heard in his voice now. He’s got the
judging eyes of the room fixed silently on him. He sees an
open laptop on a desk.
LIONEL (CONT’D)
Anybody mind if I?
Reggie shifts a bit as Lionel goes to the laptop and pulls up
the party on Facebook. The crowd gathers around as Lionel
browses through the photos.
LIONEL (CONT’D)
I mean...I don’t know. This is
fucked up right?
REGGIE
Alright brother. What’s the plan?
88.
Lionel realizes the eyes aren’t judging. They’re mobilizing.
Readying for action. Lionel steels himself.
LIONEL
We go over there. Now.
CURLS
Think there’s enough of us?
SUNGMI
You know you don’t have a monopoly
on being a pissed off minority.
Latino’s United is meeting across
the hall. Asian American League
too.
(off the stares)
You guys got better snacks.
87 INT. GILLESPIE HALL - NIGHT 87
Troy scrolls through an endless amount of Facebook uploads
from the party. Forties, bad Afro wigs, fake asses.
Shoved in between two RICH OLD WELL TO DOS at a long table
covered in empty plates and glasses - Troy looks across to
his father, in mid exaggerated guffaw with President
Fletcher.
TROY
Dad...
DEAN FAIRBANKS
Not now Troy.
TROY
It’s important. There’s something
happening on campus. I might’ve...
DEAN FAIRBANKS
You’re being rude son.
Dean Fairbanks turns away. Troy ponders a moment and then--
TROY
Oh am I? How about I tell your
precious donors and anyone here
who’ll listen about the kind of a
school it is they’re giving to?
The Dean can feel the eyes of the Donors and the President on
him - an outrage comes over him as he pulls Troy aside.
89.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
I don’t know who you think you are
young man but you don’t get to talk
to your father any kind of way.
TROY
All I say to you is yes sir and no
sir! Look I should’ve brought this
up before but --
(off Fairbanks dismissal)
-- listen to me!
Dean Fairbanks tries to cover this moment with a smile.
88 INT. KURT’S KITCHEN - NIGHT 88
Kurt, still dazed, huddles with his core Pastiche group.
KURT
What?
GORDON
Yeah dude. We all got it. I mean,
everything’s cool right?
A noise in the other room startles them...
88A LIVING ROOM 88A
...It’s Reggie who knocks over a bowl of chips. Dreads argues
with a few people. Martin rips shades off a kid’s face. The
party swarms with BSU kids and their Latino / Asian allies.
A SMASH yanks Kurt’s attention back to the kitchen...
88B KITCHEN 88B
...where Lionel smashes bottles of liquor in the sink.
KURT
Lionel?
Kurt yanks the booze from Lionel and shoves him.
KURT (CONT’D)
The fuck you think you’re doing
man?
Lionel shoves Kurt into the bar divide. A few of the BSU kids
flood into the kitchen and hold Kurt back.
KURT (CONT’D)
That all you got?
90.
LIONEL
We’re putting an end to this Kurt.
KURT
Fuck you I’m calling the cops.
MARTIN
Half of this crowd is under 21.
A loud AMP sound alerts everyone to the DJ platform in the
Living Room.
88C LIVING ROOM 88C
Mitch has taken over the mic.
MITCH
Gimme that mic
Before I slap ya
Looking for some dykes,
that wanna another chapta.
If you do me slow,
you can do me faster,
I’ll pass you to the Nigga on my
right, he gets you after.
LIONEL
Kurt--
KURT
-- Why don’t you tuck your tail
between your legs, run and tell the
Dean and get the fuck out.
Lionel sinks from this attack while his posse from BSU
watches helplessly as the party goes back into full swing.
Lionel turns to go and spots...
...George who joins Annie, fresh beer in hand. But right
behind George is...
...Sam, having just arrived with her camera in hand pointed
at the rap battle. She winks at Lionel.
Lionel turns around - summons something from deep inside.
Lionel steps onto the DJ platform and snatches the mic out of
one of the rapper’s hands.
LIONEL
Heyyyy! Hoooo! Heyyy! Hooo!
91.
The crowd is with it - thinks it’s part of the show as Lionel
proceeds to freestyle terribly...
LIONEL (CONT’D)
My name is Lionel,
Some people call me Li.
Lots of people think
that I talk kinda white.
Well that’s alright.
Yeah that’s cool.
I’d rather you think I’m white,
than tap dance for you.
With that Lionel takes the mic and SMASHES it on the wall. He
then takes the turntable by his hands and flips it over.
Sparks fly - the amp goes crazy - the crowd is in shock.
Lionel grabs a speaker tower and slams it to the ground.
Lionel’s off the platform now. Kurt grabs him - Reggie pushes
Kurt away in his defense.
Gordon grabs Reggie - A FIGHT BREAKS OUT.
More equipment is slammed to the ground and stomped on as the
party disintegrates into chaos.
Sam dodges fights to capture it all with the camera.
Art is being ripped from the walls. Dishes being smashed on
the ground. Arguments come to physical blows.
The steel in Sam’s gaze fades. Replaced by...heartbreak?
And then she spots...
...Coco squeezing her way through the crowd for the door.
Sam’s camera and mic stay trained on Coco.
COCO
What? Say it. Come on.
Sam stays silent.
COCO (CONT’D)
This may come as a shock, but these
people don’t give a fuck about no
Harriet muthafuckin Tubman. They
pay millions of dollars on their
tans, their lips, their asses, Jay-
Z tickets, you name it, cause they
wanna be us.
92.
(MORE)
So they got to be for a night.I’m
not about to go out into the
streets in protest of a Halloween
party.
Sam keeps her mouth shut and her camera rolling as Coco
realizes it’s herself she’s trying to convince.
Coco storms off. Sam exhales and lowers her camera. This is
new for her. Keeping her mouth shut.
89 EXT. KURT’S HOUSE - NIGHT 89
Coco trudges down the side walk - yanks off her hair, her
lashes, her bling - shedding the shame of the night.
90 EXT. KURT’S YARD - NIGHT 90
Kurt hustles Lionel out into the yard. Kurt shoves him to the
ground.
KURT
Dude. I know you can’t help it...
Lionel just gets back up again only to be slammed down.
KURT (CONT’D)
...but why are you such a fag dude?
Lionel spits in Kurt’s face and pops right back up again. We
see it in his eyes - he’ll never give up.
Kurt’s hand is on Lionel’s collar. He pushes him down again.
Kids are all around - some from the BSU - some from Pastiche -
some from the Bugle. Everyone holds an opposite party back.
Lionel looks over at his audience and then into Kurt’s eyes.
Lionel leans in and kisses Kurt on the mouth long and hard.
LIONEL
Finally got me where you want me.
Kurt’s in shock. He looks at his crew who laugh at him.
Lionel sees the surprise in the eyes of his new supporters as
well. No time to soak this in though. Kurt’s let up. For a
moment. Lionel turns back to Kurt and PUNCHES him in the
face. The BSU kids go CRAZY in support.
The shock gone - Kurt damn near knocks Lionel out.
The world goes all slow motion and out of focus. Lionel sort
of makes out that Kurt is yanked off him.
93.
COCO (CONT’D)
Kids run in different directions - Flashlights fill the yard -
One is shone directly on Lionel. CAMPUS SAFETY GUARDS and a
couple POLICE OFFICERS surround him.
91 INT. KURT’S HOUSE - NIGHT 91
The motor on Sam’s Super 8 ticks away. The party is at a
complete standstill.
Troy enters and looks around in disbelief. Makes eye contact
with Kurt who is being held by a Campus Safety Officer.
Dean Fairbanks enters and stands in the middle of the chaos.
Sam tip toes in for a close up and holds out a small mic.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
What is all this?
92 INT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT 92
A SERIES OF SHOTS FROM A MOVIE BEING PROJECTED ON A SCREEN
We see the Dean looking about the party with disappointment.
CUT TO:
92A KURT looking bewildered outside his house after the 92A
party. We hear BOOS from a crowd. The carnage is devastating.
Windows are blown out - trash and destroyed furniture on the
lawn. Ash where fires were put out.
KURT
I didn’t do this. Sam. I had
nothing to do with this.
CUT TO:
92B MORNING NEWS 92B

What some are calling a “race war”
has erupted at one of the nation’s

Dean Fairbanks and President Fletcher for a Town Hall.
Everyone wears a look of outrage.
94.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
We don’t condone this egregious
event and are investigating its
origins. The president and I are
looking at ways to address issues
of Diversity at Manchester.
REGGIE
HOUSING REFORM!
Applause breaks out amongst the crowd. But so do boos.
CUT TO:
93 VARIOUS SPOTS AROUND CAMPUS. Students address the camera. 93
MITCH
I’m sorry but it’s bullshit. Yo
this is how we get down. If you
can’t take a joke in this day and
age? The fact we can joke about it
proves we’ve moved on you feel me?
This is an attack on free speech!
We’re the victims here!
CUT TO:
93A A series of Busts have been PAINTED IN BLACK FACE outside 93A
of Armstrong / Parker where Lionel address the camera...
LIONEL
It’s hard enough for us to even get
into a school like this. Let alone
succeed. Find our way. This is only
a debate because of who Kurt’s dad
is, which just proves the point.
All you did was have a radio show
and look what happened to you.
CUT TO:
93B COCO as she talks directly to camera. 93B

I know this may come as a shock,
but nobody gives a fuck about no

CUT TO:
95.
93C A POSTER featuring Troy rendered like the famous Shepard 93C
Fairy Obama posters with the words “A NEW HOPE” written at
the bottom as well as “TROY BROUSSARD FOR PRESIDENT.” This
gets some more applause from the crowd watching.
TROY
Of course I got my dad involved. It
was the right thing to do. I didn’t
mean for all this to happen. All
the posters and everything.
SAM (O.S.)
But you’d welcome it? A shot for
school president.
TROY
I think...I’d make more than few
people happy if I ran.
CUT TO:
93D RADIO BOOTH - where Sam puts her headphones on. She 93D
lingers.
SAM (V.O.)
Even though I’d been expressly
forbidden to do so, I wanted to do
one last show. Something to sum up
the moment. To savor in the pop of
the post racial bubble just burst.
SAM
Dear White People...
SAM (V.O.)
I wanted to react.
Sam takes in a thoughtful breath before...
SAM
...Know what? Nevermind.
She fades in a melancholy piece of Be-Bop before hanging her
headpones up as the title on the projected movie fades in:
“...BLACK FACES BY SAMANTHA WHITE”
Sam stares nervously at the screen as the lights come on,
when all at once the room BREAKS INTO APPLAUSE. Sam turns to
see that the entire room is on it’s feet including Prof
Bodkin and Gabe.
96.
94 INT. DEAN’S OFFICE - DAY 94
Dean Fairbanks loosens his tie, flanked by several SCHOOL
OFFICIALS. They’ve been here for hours listening to...
KURT
Once I heard what the group was
planning, I sent out an email to
the staff to cancel it. You have
the email printed in front of you.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
Who’s this?
Kurt turns to a SUITED MAN next to him.
KURT
My lawyer.
CUT TO:
94B We’ll be cross cutting between several of these sessions. 94B
COCO
So when I got the invite and saw
everyone clicking “yes” I figured
it was back on.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
You were hoping to make the staff?
COCO
...
CUT TO:
DEAN FAIRBANKS
At what point in time did you show
up to the event?
94C Sam sits with arms folded. 94C
DEAN FAIRBANKS (CONT’D)
Samantha. Please.
SAM
Why am I even here?
CUT TO:
KURT
94 Guys throw parties at the house all 94
the time.
97.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
We know you were planning this.
KURT
Your son tell you that?
CUT TO:
94D Fairbanks stares down his son. Troy is silent and anxious.9 4D
DEAN FAIRBANKS
(reading)
“...wishing you could sip on Henny
out yo crunk cup without a Bitch

(and then)
You write this Troy?
Troy looks up at his father embarrassed.
TROY
No. Mine wasn’t chosen.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
But you wanted to be?
TROY
What I wanted didn’t matter then.
Why should it matter now? I told
you about the party, remember?
CUT TO:
DEAN FAIRBANKS
94 The invite came from the Pastiche 94
Facebook account.
KURT
I loathe Facebook.
An OFFICIAL whispers something in Fairbanks' ear.
KURT (CONT’D)
You’ve got to believe me.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
You’ve used that line on me before
this year Mr. Fletcher. When a
homophobic message mysteriously
appeared on a voice mail line you
shared with a roommate.
CUT TO:
98.
DEAN FAIRBANKS (CONT’D)
What were your intentions when you
went back the second time?
LIONEL
To stop it.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
By any means necessary?
LIONEL
Someone once told me...Manchester
is like jazz. I don’t know much
about jazz. But from what I can
tell, when your solo’s up, you
better blow.
Fairbanks fights a smile.
CUT TO:
94C SAM 94C
All I did that night was hit record
brother.
The Dean takes a gulp from a glass of water. He stands and
looks out his huge windows onto the campus below.
CUT TO:
94E The Dean has Facebook opened on his computer. Officials 94E
are taking a break. Drinking water. Discussing the day.
The Dean tries a few passwords.
CUT TO:
94C DEAN FAIRBANKS 94C
Want to hear something strange?
The Dean turns from the window.
DEAN FAIRBANKS (CONT’D)
The Pastiche group page hadn’t been
used for months, until the invite
went out.
CUT TO:
94E The Dean tries a different password. Still invalid. 94E
CUT TO:
99.
94C SAM 94C
Fascinating.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
Well what’s interesting is how easy
it was to access the group before
the note was sent. The password was
“Pa$tiche” spelled with a dollar
sign according to Kurt. Seems
recently it’s been changed.
CUT TO:
94E The Dean tries one more. It works. 94E
CUT TO:
94C DEAN FAIRBANKS (CONT’D) 94C
Couldn’t figure it out at first.
Then I thought to try something.
Five, seven, eight, three, five,
twenty six, one, nine, four, six.
Eleven numbers. Just like our
student ID numbers. Just like your
student ID number.
SAM
As much as you hate him, you will
stop at nothing to protect your
master and his boy.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
Did you send out the invite Sam?
SAM
That invite, whoever sent it
should’ve been met with derision
and outrage. Instead, a hundred
people showed up and they pulled
out posters and decorations and
costumes they’d made for just such
an occasion.
Sam and Dean Fairbanks at a stalemate.
Silence falls in the room. The Dean’s mind ticks.
95 EXT. MANCHESTER UNIVERSITY - DAY 95
A pack of EMERALD BUGLE newspapers hit the stand with the
headline: “INVESTIGATION INCONCLUSIVE! FLETCHER GOES FREE. NO
EXPULSIONS MADE”
100.
Next to it is another stack of papers from the INDEPENDENT
OBSERVER. The headline reads: “EBONY & IVY: CAN THERE BE
HARMONY? BY LIONEL HIGGINS.”
George picks up a copy of the Observer and starts to read...
96 INT. TROY AND LIONEL’S APARTMENT - DAY 96
Lionel flips through his own article as well. A satisfied
grin on his face as a razor makes its way through his hair.
LIONEL
2 Chainz? Shaft? While endless
complex depictions of whites, white
men in particular exist - there
aren’t that many versions of us in
the culture.
His locks waft towards the ground as Troy styles a fresh and
fearless fro-hawk atop Lionel’s head.
LIONEL (CONT’D)
Culture has a powerful way of
telling people what they can and
can’t be. For people of color the
options are rather limited.
TROY
Next James Baldwin up in here. Wait
hold on a sec.
Star Trek is back from commercial break. Troy and Lionel
watch in silence.
97 EXT. MANCHESTER UNIVERSITY - DAY 97
Gabe is just about finished with Lionel’s article too. Looks
up just in time to see...
GABE
Hello Sam.
Sam sneers at his formalities.
GABE (CONT’D)
Read about Armstrong / Parker.
SAM
Yeah. Prez made an executive
withdrawal. Armstrong stays Black.
GABE
Congrats?
101.
SAM
(with a shrug)
Getting too dramatic man. Thinking
about getting an apartment off
campus. We’ll see.
GABE
Sam going against the grain?
Shocked. How’s papa White?
SAM
He’s recovering.
GABE
Good. Well...
Gabe fights the urge to hug her.
SAM
We were actually on the phone last
night for hours. First time we
talked since the bypass. He was
putting up a strong front. Teasing
me about being so worried. Then
came the stories about me as a
little girl I’d heard a thousand
times. About how independent I was.
Gabe smiles politely. Senses she needs a moment.
GABE
Want to talk about it?
SAM
My mother worked nights so he would
take me to school. And it pissed me
off because he would follow me all
the way to homeroom. Every time he
tried to hold my hand I’d scream
and pull away. He thought I was
just being...difficult.
A hint of recognition in Gabe. Is this about them?
SAM (CONT’D)
But it was the kids. And the
parents and the teachers. They’d
see this Black girl and this white
man and wonder what we were doing
together. Even at nine I could feel
their eyes on me. Especially at
nine. It brought tears to my eyes.
Gabe’s stone face melts at this.
102.
SAM (CONT’D)
I was just a bratty girl, didn’t
know any better but-- The thought
of losing him-- You know? I just
feel so bad. How awful am I to do
that to him? To anyone I love?
Gabe gets it. This is an explanation. An apology, to him. His
arm is on her shoulder now.
GABE
I’m sure he forgives you.
SAM
Think so?
Gabe nods. Sam’s normal defenses come back up lest she cries.
SAM (CONT’D)
So anyway. I didn’t mean to say all
of that. I don’t know why I did.
GABE
Sam. Where are you going?
SAM
I don’t know. Lunch?
Gabe starts to walk with her.
GABE
Isn’t it Mac and Cheese day at
Armstrong/Parker?
SAM
Think they’ll let you in?
Gabe smiles. They walk a bit. Then he grabs her hand. Sam
lets the moment happen. Squeezes his back. They look into
each others’ eyes.
Don’t even notice as Reggie and the Bofros pass them by.
98 INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 98
Coco sits across from Helmut. He’s got his eyes on a Youtube
clip from Sam’s movie featuring Coco.
COCO (YOUTUBE)
I know this may come as a shock,
but they don’t give a fuck about no
Harriet muthafuckin Tubman...
103.
HELMUT
Two hundred thousand views. Look
they even auto-tuned it.
With a click Helmut pulls it up.
AUTOTUNED COCO (YOUTUBE)
Muthafuckin Tubman! Muthatfuckin
Tubman! Don’t give a fuck about no
muthafuckin Tubman!
Coco’s not sure what to think.
HELMUT
Couple months, that’s how long
shooting for an episode takes. We
recommend you cut your course load
in half to accommodate the
schedule.
COCO
Half?
HELMUT
Trust me it it’ll read “full-time”
in the episode. If...once we go to
series, we might have to figure out
a summer schedule.
COCO
For shooting?
HELMUT
For uh...classes and stuff. Won’t
be graduating early anymore
sweetheart.
Helmut shifts a contract over to Coco.
HELMUT (CONT’D)
Five grand for the episode. Twenty
each if you get picked up for
series. What do you say?
Coco stares at the contract and back at Helmut.
HELMUT (CONT’D)
Trust me sweetie it’s the same out
there as it is in here. Good news
is? Against all that damn white you
and I? We pop. Think I wanted to be
the go-to producer for all things
Black?
104.
Coco shrugs.
HELMUT (CONT’D)
Tell you what’s worse though. Being
that broke Nigga stuck on the south
side of Chicago. Hundred and
Fiftieth street.
Coco takes a deep breath. Stares right into his eyes --
99 EXT. MANCHESTER - DAY 99
Coco exits a building and spots Troy up ahead. He’s flanked
by his former enemies turned supporters, Reggie and the other
BoFros. They all carry Troy’s “New Hope” posters.
COCO
Made some new friends?
Troy shrugs as Coco grabs for his hand. He pulls away and
shares a glance with Reggie, who doesn’t approve.
COCO (CONT’D)
Fine.
TROY
Come on Coco.
COCO
Fuck you.
Coco starts to walk ahead.
TROY
My dad saw your videos. He’s a
little worried about --
COCO
-- how it’ll look. With your
campaign and all. What’s your best
friend Reggie think?
Troy motions for Reggie to go on ahead.
TROY
We had fun, alright?
COCO
I get everyone else wants you to
win Troy. But do you?
Troy doesn’t know how to answer that. He stares at the
triumphant, winning version of himself on his poster.
105.
Coco’s eyes shift longingly as she walks ahead - unsure of
who she is at the moment and who she will be in the next.
Watching her is Lionel and Sam - sitting with Gabe and
Sungmi. They both know that look well...
SAM
Hey Lionel. With me out and Troy
moving on - A/P’s going to need a
new head of house.
LIONEL
Think there’s a story there? Who do
you think it’ll be?
Sam and Sungmi share a glance and stare right at Lionel.
LIONEL (CONT’D)
What? No.
SUNGMI
Everyone loves you. Won’t be hard
to rally the vote.
SAM
Yeah. We got you man.
Lionel takes in this moment. One of complete acceptance.
100 INT. FLETCHERS OFFICE - DAY 100
Fairbanks turns from the window in Fletcher’s office to join
him at his desk. They’re all ears as they look across to...
HELMUT
Let me get this straight. First you
tried to break up the Black house.
Then you took down the sister with
the little radio show. And after
all that, your kid throws a
Blackface party?
FLETCHER
Now wait a minute!
HELMUT
You thought you were having money
problems before? Wait till cable
gets their hands on this story.
Bill Maher is gon’ fuck you up!
FLETCHER
I have heard enough --
106.
HELMUT
-- Wait I’m sorry. Look from where
I’m sitting this place is a
goldmine.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
What?
HELMUT
For one we got to show the events
that led up to the party --
DEAN FAIRBANKS
-- That already happened.
HELMUT
Well yeah, but we can reenact --
DEAN FAIRBANKS
-- reenact?
HELMUT
Documentary term...Look, I can
start putting together an overall
deal today. I’m talking real money!
Turns out the one thing America
likes in it’s reality more than
ignant Black folks, is crazy racist
White people!
DEAN FAIRBANKS
Now you look here. This is an
honorable institution. The idea
that we would so much as entertain
this suggestion --
Fletcher holds his hand up. His turn to speak.
FLETCHER
How much we talking?
Fairbanks’ outrage turns to resignation as Helmut, the one
winner here smiles. Dollar signs in his eyes.

Black M,Lay_Up.m4a (Instrumental),"21 ContributorsThree Wise Men | O.C.D Cypher #1 Lyrics[Verse 1: Chris Rivers]
Please believe these CDs and sheets will bring me peace like treaties
Heebie jeebies my species bring evil deeds like a Ouija
Eating Greasy but sure as the leaves are green we defeat these
And I believe cause trees came from planting seeds in the fecees
Tho I got pro ambition this liquor help me speakeasy
The bees knees thinking I'm sweet means diabetes
Police see me bleeding as growth like bowls of wheeties
Jesus pieces needed no preaching slinging the pcp please see me
Yak yak put the coniac in a black Bag
Sip it in the back of a rag tag ac that's
All I could afford til I'm poppin on ascap
Test me get crossed out twice like hash tag
New dark knights coming like Affleck
You seen it once maybe twice like a snap chat
Never run for my life that's a back track
And all my niggas stay strapped team back pack
Uh I can beat the sun in a stare off
I can be the one in a pair off
You probably shoot a layup get an air ball
Horse stance crane stance uh nigha  bear claw
Impair snares flares make the air cough
Quitting once you see me that's a fair call
Don't you ever leave your girl around me nigha I be all up in that pussy like a hair ball

[Verse 2: Oswin Benjamin]
No matter how you flip Denzil, Os and Chris know it's still a slaughter
All the rn's know d.o.c's what the doctor ordered
O.C.D., see we been cleansing the game so fuck a disorder
Lethal weapons when we penning, C, O, D, no console needed
My p.o.v is G-o-d's e.k.g, the heart beat of a martyr
More souls then a. million men marching/ Darwin evolved this Oswin to Martin
Star gazing now a day/ is the same as looking in a mirror
All blue Yankee like I’m Hova, the brim is grey from new era
The sky is grey and cup overfloweth with me new errors
The new mistakes that I'm making cuz winnings what os.wins scared of
My soul my peace of mind and the industry had a stare off
Close to the cliff like Clair Huxtable (God I hope I don't steer off)
Autumn know I'm the son of the summer scorching the fall
Pallbearer, bearing this gift of vitality for ya
The ghost of Christopher Wallace just tried to drown me in the holy water/
Slapped me out of my christening so I face the palms of big poppa
The palms of this author orchestrates psalms for mobsters
Songs for contraband where the swinging hands like black conductor
Songs in the key of a 1,000 grams on a grand piano
Sonically This dope is superb enough to revive Seattle/
Hey man this rain man/ (poor) pour enough to throw a sea.at you
‘Cuz I'm tide( tired)/ of the current
The people lookin at me. And feel. He (Philly)/ stands. firms.for all he believes like a rocky statue
D. you ever do fall. off heathes. Ledge I know the lord Got you
You might also like[Verse 3: Denzil Porter]
But oz, if i do i really hope its a clear fall/
Careful
When i go off/
Niggas lose more
Than pierre paul/
(That was so foul)
It's a clear call
With these bear claws
I yank a bitch like wierd all
(you mean wierd al)
Man im smoked thought
(you mean smoked out)
But im back in the zone when/
The track, hit the gas i attract to the tone then/
I attack, like im in a parking lot with a tat that said bad to the bone then
Put out when im going in/
And these bars so enlarged in my noggin, surprise im disguised, in real life im a cone head/
They try tell me dont curse, all you hear is beep beep beep you would swear a nigga going dead/
But thank you thank you, so kindly, there screaming loudly
Black actor as human torch they finally made a movie bout me
Black magic for haters, friendships thats forged when they truly doubt me/
I had it of lately, pouting bout cowards thats making, /
The culture a place thats
Deserted of knowledge and patience/
The doctors acknowledge no patience, they just say take this/
Pill
Kill yourself slowly and painless/
But this that piss up in the morning
Don't forget where your aim is/
Dont forget what yo names is...
You could call me balthasar, and dont forget who i came with/
Words, concepts and bars, 3 wise men we the latest/
We the latest closest to gods and we bring gifts from the savior/
In reality we are the stars, that come out when you say save us/
From darkness
The haters, game has, been infiltrated by traitors
Now play ya
Cards right before somebody take em and trade em/
Or pawn em
Im taking limbs too im vietnamin/
Im fly and im intercoming
My niggas oswin or chris rivers  bomb em/
[Verse 4: Oswin Benjamin]
I told J I'm two cool L's away from a Kangol
A whip away from django/
A critics opinion away to losing my ear like a Van Gogh/
A starving artist. Under unemployment. Coining phrases/ hoping he has enough on pump 87 to make this Van Go/
At least rite.aid/
I'm tired of riding around commando/
Sorry if that's too. Much. Info/
Mation for y'all to handle/
Two other wise men aside a me know.that I'm los.ing/
The soul in me try.ing to prove.that/
I'm more. then a bible student/
More then a couple scriptures/
This misconception is brewing/
A Jesus escariot/
I purposely didn't say judas/
I know what I'm doing/
I'm simply stating I'm human/
I'll take shot of tequila with the same lips I use for communion nigga/
I send a prayer and do the shooting nigga/
I'm not concious
I'm un.conscious
I read the book James. And still.get. Neck like an ostrich
A prostitute and a prophet
Nigga
I came with with two other wise men to body you niggas
[Verse 5: Chris Rivers]
Young monster marcher that conjured karma to conquer
Dishonor leads to arms swinging razor blades like a barber
Diminish your soul and image like armored trucks to a Tonka
Willy wonka chompas gap in every tooth like Moses part the
Oceans I'm chosen tho holding clothes that was thrown in holes like I'm Oscar
Larger and darker than life's price which I ponder
Cause poppa died but hold it down my momma  get your moms snuffed
The Type to set a stance and move a mountain with a palm thrust

[Verse 6: Denzil Porter]
Uhm just, know that they can't calm us/
In hip hop, we don't shoot if you put your arms up/
Keep in mind my mind is too meraculous marvelouse/
I don't let nuttin by me, guess my minds like a contra- septive
Yes it's , who your girl want to get with/
I left her pussy red, but left her blue guess i set tripped/ uh
(You went through all of that with her)
Now she falling back nigga/
(she wanta netflix and chill)
But we skipped all of that nigga/
Now im, left with this pitty, all my ex's are pretty/
But only time my ex is up is when im repping my city/
My weapons a pen and a pad and when im prepping i shimmy
Im doing a dance like im diddy
Bad boy with the pimmy
Thats uptown slang, that soured
Because i come from the north
You see i always come in first you built to last like a ford/
And on my, last i afford
To get past and move forward
Relaxed then relapse but in fact I just came back like a chord
The spinal
Can't do what i do
My rhymes are from times of vinyls/
And ciphers come at your vitals
With rivals who try to fight you
Or knife you so bring your rifle
Your wisdom and bring your bible
Don't be shook, don't bring your rap book, just bring your title/
Gotta buzz right?
(Yea)
You got some thugs right
(yea)
Maybe you could sign your bugged life here/
You got my bud right
(Yea)
You got my bud light?
(here)
...where the fuck you get this buzz light year?
Hold up, we are are no colly bones/
We over heads like carry ons/
When i kick it, i take one to the face, i call it holly holmes/
Then i be gone/ im out like a stale mate/
I got the kinda drive, that nobody could tailgate/
Could tell fake, haters, fuck you , you could blow me/
Even in real life i leave the hating comments below me/
You know i gotta keep going, until they sick of it/
Until my pen is selling (penicillin) so strong, they could use that shit to kill syphillis/

[Verse 7: Chris Rivers]
And cure this infinite imminent fall of man with these intricate flipped lyrics like siscor kicks that's been given a gift foretold like a syllabus
Tried to reach for the stars but your bars are icharus
My ligaments propel me to heights so blow me like instruments
Ironic nighas writtens are sounding like they're illiterate
I hit the liquor with spliffs rolled from a bit of Leviticus
While we breaching the boarders and porters order some immigrants
And I'm just looking for fellow lyricists  I can nigga wit
Modern day bastards with a passion rap words like a pastor
Add verbs to my verses create disasters
Cause with the world on my shoulders when I walk I collapse earth
And all my nighas is raw like war backwards
Three wise men ain't taking no losses with oswins and King Kong ain't got nothing on Denzel so we flowing like rivers birthing leviathans higher than firemen admiring burnt down trap houses taking after whifs of that finer blend
I am him we are they and no ones blessed with nicer
We're dogs you're cats with no rats like someone stressed the piper
Three wise men with a gift for your flesh in diapers
Even if you trained til you're grown you couldn't best this cypher challenge5Embed"

Black M,Leen & Purple Females,"1 ContributorDear White People Screenplay Lyrics1 NEWS BROADCAST - VARIOUS SCREENS, VARIOUS PLACES 1
ANCHOR
A “race war” has erupted at one of
the nation’s oldest and most
prestigious institutions.
Glued to this are our story’s subjects, who we meet in...
2 A SERIES OF SHOTS 2
TROY FAIRBANKS, 21, Black. He drags a brush through his
finger waves anxiously. The look of guilt is the only mark
of imperfection in his privileged and chiseled demeanor.
ANCHOR (O.S.)
Outrage over an “African American
Themed” party organized by
predominately white students of
Manchester University has resulted
in rioting and property damages.
2A KURT FLETCHER, 21, white. No sympathy in his jaded blue 2A
eyes as he watches on an iPad in a lavish parlor room.
ANCHOR (O.S.) (CONT’D)
Guests were invited to “liberate
their inner Negro, fry up chicken,
enjoy a sugar water concoction
known as Purple drank and wear
oversized Barack Obama T-shirts.”
2B COLANDREA CONNERS (COCO), 20, Black with blue contacts 2B
adjusts the straight bangs of her weave to better see the
small TV in her dorm. A smirk on her glossy pink lips. *
ANCHOR (CONT’D)
Officials claim an investigation is
underway to find those responsible
for the event and subsequent riot.
2C SAMANTHA WHITE (SAM) 21, records the broadcast in an 2C
edit bay. Despite her light skin, the Afro pick in her fro
pompadour leaves little doubt she identifies as Black.
ANCHOR (CONT’D)
In an effort to address diversity
issues, the school appointed
African American scholar Dr. Walter
Fairbanks as Dean of Students.
2D LIONEL HIGGINS, 20, Black, watches through dark rimmed 2D
glasses in a bustling indifferent Dining Hall. A guilt pains
his otherwise boyish face.
ANCHOR (CONT’D)
Last year the Dean’s office
celebrated slight gains in diverse
applicants but with many now
calling for Fairbanks' resignation,
that may have been pre-mature.
2E DEAN WALTER FAIRBANKS, a well adorned Black man in his 2E
50’s fights a panic as he watches in a stately office.
ANCHOR (CONT’D)
Up next, a cat that loves to water
ski? That and more after the break.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
How could this happen?
TITLE CARD: FIVE WEEKS AGO
3 EXT. MANCHESTER UNIVERSITY - DAY 3
This sprawling impressive mix of Colonial, Gothic and Modern
architecture is presented like a living brochure.
SUPERIMPOSE: MANCHESTER UNIVERSITY - “NOSCE TE IPSUM”
As we cut through the living brochure, we’re presented with
groups and programs. Their CRESTS and titles SUPERIMPOSED.
SERIES OF SHOTS - TOP ACADEMIC PROGRAMS
3A White kids with “Trump” blazers and glares - DESMOND 3A
SCHOOL OF BUSINESS.
3B Kids with dark eye circles and unkempt hair stand before 3B
the BING SCHOOL OF HISTORY.
3C A cluster of skinny jeans and expressive hands before the 3C
GOODMAN MEDIA SCHOOL. ONE BLACK KID stands in the back.
SAM (V.O.)
Dear White People. The minimum
requirement of Black friends needed
to not seem racist has just been
raised to two.
4 INT. STUDIO BOOTH - DAY 4
Samantha White (Sam) watches the campus through a one way
window with the cool but knowing gaze of someone much older.
She gets off on sensing and pushing buttons - with a
subversive delivery style that boarders on deadpan.
SUPERIMPOSE: SAMANTHA WHITE, SENIOR, VISUAL AND NEW MEDIA
2.
SAM (CONT’D)
Sorry, but your weed man Tyrone
does not count.
She fades in JAZZ on her control board and leans back to
address a box of pamphlet sized books bearing the title
“EBONY AND IVY: A SURVIVAL GUIDE.” One by one she scribbles
her autograph on the books.
5 EXT. ELLINGTON LIBRARY - DAY 5
SERIES OF SHOTS - NATIONALLY RENOWNED STUDENT GROUPS
Disheveled caffeinated writers of the MANCHESTER BUGLE.
5A Casual Prepsters shoot us the finger - PASTICHE HUMOR INC. 5A
5B Hopping out of a taxi is Lionel Higgins. His sweet but 5B
insecure nature as plain as the unkempt fro on his head.
SUPERIMPOSE: LIONEL HIGGINS, JUNIOR, PHILOSOPHY UNDECLARED
STUDENTS shove past him - one even slaps a flyer into his
already full hands. Lionel’s a guppy. The kind that gets
eaten alive in a tank of sharks.
As Lionel gets to the door of a large Colonial style home he
checks his pockets. He’s missing something. Shit.
LIONEL
(knocking)
Kurt! You home?
Lionel dials on his cell and we hear the PHONE RING from
inside. Voicemail pops on with a voice other than Lionel’s.
ANSWERING MACHINE
Hey boyssss, you’ve reached Lionel
Higginsss, the only bitch on
campussss who’ll give you a
dickssscount. That’s right hunty,
the bigger the dick the less you’ll
have to pay me to ssssuck it.
The beep sounds. Lionel’s in shock. Should he hang up? Or...
LIONEL
Kurt. It’s Lionel. I’m locked out.
As Lionel slides down the length of the door into a sit he
unfolds the flyer he was just handed. It’s a rendering of Sam
White on a carton of milk with the caption:
“MISSING BLACK CULTURE - SAM WHITE TO BRING IT BLACK”
3.
6 EXT. MANCHESTER ROW - DAY 6
Signs scream out “ORIENTATION” as jazz music wafts from the
laptops of a group of NEO BEATNIKS. As the music fades...
SAM (O.S.)
Dear White People, apparently
Morgan Freeman in “Deep Impact”
wasn’t enough. Despite two terms
Obama could cure Cancer and
somewhere White folks will be
embroiled in protest. And he’s only
half Black.
GABE, 24, white and ruggedly handsome in spite of his shaggy
hair and “laundry day” flip flop clad ensemble, catches the
end of this as he passes - grabs his cell phone and dials...
7 INT. STUDIO BOOTH - DAY 7
...Sam presses a button next to a red light on her controls.
SAM
Talk to me.
INTERCUT with Gabe walking about on campus.
GABE
What would you say if someone
started a Dear Black People?
SAM
(recognizing the voice)
No need. Mass media from Fox News
to reality tv on VH1 makes it clear
what white people think of us.
8 EXT. MANCHESTER COURT - DAY 8
SERIES OF SHOTS - POPULAR RESIDENCE HALLS
Manchester’s white and rich elite before BECHET HOUSE.
8A Athletes of many disciplines before WEBSTER HOUSE. 8A
8B An eclectic group of Black students with some Latinos and 8B
a sprinkling of whites before ARMSTRONG / PARKER HOUSE.
COCO (V.O.)
I’m fucking pissed...
4.
11 INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 11
Colandrea Conners (Coco) trains her unnaturally blue eyes
right at us from a Youtube page pulled up on an iPad. She’s
got an entitled air about her. Even her cusses sound erudite.
COCO (YOUTUBE)
...I am! The whole point of
randomized housing is to mix shit
up. I’m out here trying to find the
Olivier to my Halle Berry, and
they’ve got me looking like an
extra on a Different World...
The video ends with a click. Looking up is HELMUT WEST, a
30’s something Black man in dark rimmed glasses and trendy
everything. Too stylish for this place. If he’s impressed,
it’s barely perceptible.
HELMUT
You call your Youtube show “Doing
Time at an Ivy League?”
He stares right at Coco, there in the flesh.
COCO
In my second year of a four year
sentence. Wanted to go to New York.
SUPERIMPOSE: COLANDREA COCO CONNERS, SOPHOMORE, ECONOMICS
HELMUT
Yeah? And do what?
COCO
Things my mama taught me not to.
You know get in a lot of trouble
and become famous for it. But alas
I didn’t get into Tisch...
HELMUT
Armstrong / Parker? That your
rooming assignment?
COCO
Traditionally it’s where the
hopelessly Afrocentric gather to
process their guilt over not going
to an HBCU.
(off Helmut’s look)
Where the Negros be at.
HELMUT
That’s not where you want to be?
5.
COCO
Bechet House is more my style.
HELMUT
With the rich white kids.
COCO
Excuse me?
HELMUT
What part of Chicago you from?
COCO
Hyde Park.
HELMUT
What street?
COCO
Seventy Eighth and --
HELMUT
-- Seventy Eighth is Southside
sweetheart. And you know what they
say. You can take the girl out the
hood but --
COCO
-- Ain’t nothing hood about me.
HELMUT
Thanks so much for coming in.
Coco gets up to leave. Tries to recover.
COCO
So what’s this show about anyway?
HELMUT
Here’s the way reality works
sweetheart, I’m the producer. I ask
the questions. Be in touch.
And with that Helmut hustles Coco out. He sits and ponders
before unmuting his iPad.
SAM (O.S.)
Dear White People I am here to
burst your post-racial little
bubble.
6.
(MORE)
Yes Oprah may have her own network,
but Ann Coulter is still writing
best sellers, Black kids are still
getting shot for wearing hoodies,
and even here the few vestiges of
Black culture are under attack by
conservative groups, trustees and
yes our very own President
Fletcher.
Helmut double checks his app fighting a genuine grin.
HELMUT
This is the school radio?
13 INT. ARMSTRONG / PARKER HALL - DAY 13
A pristine pair of Retro Jordans make their way through the
halls of Armstrong / Parker where Black students have lively
debates, flirt and bump the student radio.
SAM (O.S.)
Dear White People, thanks to the
new process of randomizing housing
assignments for Sophomores, some of
you may be jarred by an assignment
to Armstrong/Parker house.
The owner of the Jordans is revealed as Troy Fairbanks.
TROY
Someone turn that trash off.
SUPERIMPOSE: TROY FAIRBANKS, SENIOR, POLITICAL SCIENCE
Even with his post workout sweat he looks like the cover of
Jet. Troy exudes “approachable homie” as he spots a small
group of WHITE SOPHOMORES who walk timidly down the hall.
TROY (CONT’D)
Newbies right?
The white sophomores nod their heads yes.
TROY (CONT’D)
Welcome to Armstrong / Parker, home
of the dopest dining hall in all of
Manchester. I’m Troy, Head of
House.
SOPHOMORE
What’s up my brother?
7.
SAM (O.S.) (CONT'D)
SAM (O.S.)
When encountering a Black person
try and stay calm. Don’t say things
like “what’s up” and “my brotha”
That’s not how you normally talk.
TROY
Ya’ll take care. Nice Jordan’s bro.
Coco and SOFIA FLETCHER, a dewy-eyed, pink lipped brunette
who exudes a kind of sexy boredom saunter down the halls.
SOFIA
Your hair is so cute B. T. Dubs.
COCO
You’re so cute.
SOFIA
Is it weaved?
Coco’s face is a battle between fury and polite surprise.
SOFIA (CONT’D)
I saw “Good Hair” in Afro studies.
COCO
(moving on)
Hey what house did you get?
SOFIA
Huh? Oh Bechet bitch.
COCO
Of course. The mere thought of a
Fletcher anywhere else...
SOFIA
Easy, it was the luck of the draw.
Daddy had nothing to do with it.
Coco rolls her eyes behind a smile.
SOFIA (CONT’D)
And honestly, if I had to pick
anywhere to be it’d be here.
Sofia eyes the delicious morsels of chocolate boys about.
COCO
I’m down to switch if you are. You
get your Denzel. I get my Gosling.
8.
SOFIA
Oh I got mines. Want to meet him?
They turn the corner to spot Troy greeting more new
Sophomores. Coco’s caught off guard by his looks.
COCO
Cute...
(off Sofia’s jealous
glance)
...for a Black boy.
Troy sees Sofia and flashes his trademark grin. They kiss.
SOFIA
Hey boo. This is my friend Coco.
She’s new to the house.
TROY
Hey I’m Troy. Welcome to Armstrong
/ Parker, home of the dopest --
SOFIA
-- Are we on duty?
TROY
Head of House is always on duty.
COCO
Nice to meet you. I should get
settled. Thanks Sof!
Sofia and Troy smile as Coco turns to go - and continue down
the hallway. Coco sneaks one last glance at Troy’s ass.
TROY
Think I got time for a quick cut?
SOFIA
You got it cut last week.
TROY
It’s a Black thing babe.
SOFIA
Since when is OCD a Black thang?
TROY
Don’t say “thang” like that.
SOFIA
Besides you’ve got a shift at the
Politicos booth, then a shift at
Orientation, then your advisor --
9.
TROY
-- I’ll just wear a hat.
SOFIA
Then a movie maybe? Just us?
TROY
Election night. Babe, come on.
Sofia holds her tongue. Troy ignores this as he spots...
TROY (CONT’D)
Yo, Kurt my man.
14 DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 14
...Kurt Fletcher - flanked by guys who share his cynical
knowing glare. We recognize them from the “Pastiche” portrait
from before.
As they chow down on Mac & Cheese in the Dining Hall - Kurt’s
glare burns particularly hot towards Troy who waves at him.
KURT
Sis.
Sofia smiles at her brother Kurt. Troy covers the sting of
his dismissal.
They both spot Sam’s “Missing: Black culture” flyers.
TROY
Is she kidding with this?
SOFIA
You don’t have to run again. Just
because it’s her doesn’t mean --
TROY
-- I can’t let Sam and her wannabe
Black Panthers take the House. The
House needs me. This is who I am.
SOFIA
It’s who he wants you to be.
Troy smiles over his irritation. This is an old fight.
TROY
Oh so you pick up a Psych class you
think you Freud or something? Huh?
SOFIA
A Freud reference. Sophisticated.
10.
TROY
(seducing)
Fine Beck, Jung, Maslow...
Troy gets a kiss out of her as they pass a booth featuring
stacks of Sam’s “EBONY & IVY.” The booth is manned by REGGIE,
21, Black - his fro top and preppy punk attire is both
bohemian and radical.
Troy glares at Sam’s picture on the book. It’s on. There’s a
history between Sam and Troy. Off Reggie’s laptop we hear...
SAM (O.S.)
Dear White People, this just in.
Dating a Black person to piss off
your parents is a form of racism.
Sofia walks off as Troy hears snickers from around him.
REGGIE
Yo Troy I forget. Is your major in
shucking or was it jiving?
TROY
My major’s in Jive. Minoring in
Shuck. You’re still majoring in
trying to fuck my left overs right?
Troy walks off as Reggie and Kurt watch him join Sofia.
SOFIA
You need a shower.
15 INT. TROY’S BATHROOM - DAY 15
Water runs while Troy takes a hit of weed from a pipe over
the toilet. He blows the smoke out an open window through a
paper towel tube with a dryer sheet attached to its end. He
jots something down on a notepad as he whispers...
TROY
You went from ODB to Trey Songz...
16 INT. ARMSTRONG/PARKER DINING HALL - NIGHT 16
The hall is packed with STUDENTS - stylish and mostly Black.
Helmut West watches from the back.
TROY
Artie, you know your success ratio
with the ladies went up like thirty
percent after I started edging you
up dog, come on. You went from ODB
to Trey Songz!
11.
The audience is in STITCHES at this last line. Everyone
except Sam, Reggie and their crew of afro’d bohemian
disciples (who we’ll call the BOFROS). Sam records the
proceedings with a vintage Super 8 camera.
REGGIE
That’s his platform? Haircuts?
SAM
Oofta is as Oofta does.
Coco, sneaks through the door. She’s got the eyes of Helmut
on her. What is he doing here? As Coco breaks eye contact she
sits in the only open spot next to...
SAM (CONT’D)
Just because we’re colored don’t
mean we run on colored people time.
COCO
Boycotting hot combs don’t make you
an expert on “colored people” boo.
Coco wafts her silky hair over her shoulders and sits.
TROY
No but seriously, I care about you
guys. I care about this house. We
had a great year last year and if
it ain’t broke...
Troy basks in his applause. Coco eats him up with her eyes.
Sam doesn’t want to get up - her breathing gets heavier.
REGGIE
Just pretend like you’re in the
booth. Just you and the mic.
SAM
Hate this shit.
As Sam gets up and passes Troy --
TROY
You really think you can take this
from me?
SAM
Troy we live in a world where
there’s a Big Momma’s House 3. I
don’t have a chance in hell. Thank
God.
12.
Sam grabs the mic. Her voice shakes before the silent crowd.
SAM (CONT’D)
Troy my brother, it’s broke.
The BoFros cheer and make noise on each line.
SAM (CONT’D)
Troy’s a legacy kid. And yet it’s
under his watch that Armstrong /
Parker, the bastion of Black
culture here was gutted. By the
Randomization of Housing Act.
Second years of color no longer
have a say in where they go. The
culture that’s been fostered in
this house for two decades will be
wiped out in two years.
Troy looks to see if the speech is working. As Sam warms up --
SAM (CONT’D)
This wasn’t motivated by a desire
to mix things up. Bring about
racial and socioeconomic harmony.
No, the Black kids are sitting
together in the proverbial
cafeteria and they must be up to no
good.
Coco’s eyes are in the back of her head.
SAM (CONT’D)
We sit together to protect
ourselves. Over a century of houses
grouped by sports affiliations,
political leanings, majors, you
name it. Black folks get their own
house, suddenly we got a problem?
Students look at each other stunned. Are they turning? Sam
delivers the next one directly at Sofia and Troy.
SAM (CONT’D)
This Act doesn’t affect the other
houses like it does ours. There are
plenty of trustees, former coaches,
and presidents watching out for the
others. All we have is a Dean who’d
rather please his massa --
TROY
-- Yo that’s enough of that Sam --
13.
SAM
-- then stand up for his own. Look,
I know ya’ll ain’t voting for me.
Ya’ll ain’t ready and I didn’t come
here for that. The Black Student
Union and I have brought a petition
to repeal the Randomization of
Housing Act. I plan on bringing it
to the President and together we
can bring Black back to Manchester.
It’ll be by the door.
Sam sits as claps trickle from the crowd. The BoFros go crazy
- give her daps and all sorts of praise.
MARTIN, 20, a gentle erudite giant of a football player with
neat braids tucked under a Fedora raises a hand.
MARTIN
I assume everyone has the app I
created by now?
REGGIE
(aside)
It’s a child’s app...
MARTIN
Good. Voting may commence.
Everyone takes out smart phones. Reggie hides his from view
as he punches something in.
Troy spots the white Sophomores he greeted from before who
give him a head nod. Troy’s got this. After a moment...
MARTIN (CONT’D)
Okay. Looks like we’ve got
ourselves a winner.
(devastated)
Sam White?
The blood drains from Sam’s face and Troy’s smile plummets
into the floor as the two turn to look at each other.
TROY & SAM
Oh shit.
Reggie’s grin is from ear to ear as Helmut walks over and
slips a card to a still stunned Sam. Coco watches him go.
17 INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT 17
Right on the heels of Helmut’s exit is...
14.
COCO
So that’s what you’re looking for?
HELMUT
I’m looking for good TV sister.
COCO
I think I’d be good TV.
HELMUT
You’re at a great school, getting a
great education. Be good at that.
COCO
I am. And when I graduate early
with an Economics degree from
Manchester it will be the crowning
achievement of my Black middle
class parents’ ambitions.
HELMUT
Conflict is a commodity in my
industry. Sam’s got it. Do you?
COCO
So you want me to start a fight.
HELMUT
(exactly)
I don’t want you to do anything you
wouldn’t otherwise do.
Helmut hands her his card. A fire sparks in Coco as he exits.
He contemplates her. Fights a growing smile.
18 INT. DEAN’S OFFICE - DAY 18
A fireplace rages behind Lionel who stares at the floor while
the message plays over speaker phone.
SPEAKER
...bigger the dick the less you’ll
have to pay me to ssssuck it.
Dean Fairbank’s mind ticks away behind a concerned glare.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
Most everything’s locked up, but
we’ll find another residence to
move you to. Third time’s a charm.
(off Lionel’s sigh)
What about Armstrong / Parker?
15.
LIONEL
I don’t know...
DEAN FAIRBANKS
I might have an opening. Maybe it’d
be good to be around...you know.
LIONEL
Dean. The worst thing about high
school, and believe me it was a
long list, were the Black kids.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
Maybe it’s in your head. Sure,
sometimes our folks can be
intolerant around people like you.
Homo --
LIONEL
-- I don’t believe in labels.
Fairbanks just smiles. This is a sore spot and he backs off.
Lionel glares up at a poster above Fairbank’s desk: Students
of all races on the steps of Ellington Library including Troy
with the phrase “MANCHESTER: WHERE YOU BELONG” printed below.
Troy’s huge smile seems to mock him.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
You like jazz Lionel? Manchester’s
like jazz you know.
LIONEL
This is a research school.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
And jazz is tension. The interplay
of improvised solos all creating
one song. Your problem is you’ve
got no instrument. No major, no
affiliations, no solo son.
LIONEL
I submit articles to the
Independent Observer.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
No one reads the Independent
Observer, my point is are you
playing swing or bebop?
LIONEL
You’re mixing metaphors.
16.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
Are you a sax or are you a trumpet?
LIONEL
I hate jazz.
Fairbanks checks his watch. All out of ideas.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
I’ll do what I can. Not a word of
this in the Observer okay?
LIONEL
What’s it matter? No one reads it.
19 EXT. MANCHESTER - DAY 19
Lionel walks alone through the buzzing campus. He looks out
to..
...a group of BLACK KIDS. He sees a version of himself
amongst them - his hair a finger waved Ceasar fade, as he
trades “No Homo’s” with the others.
Lionel shakes it off. Peers over to a group of out and proud
gay kids and sees a version of himself amongst them - his
hair straightened and coifed in a fitted shirt laughing.
Not right either. Where does he fit? By surprise...
GEORGE
Lionel right?
GEORGE PIERCE, 24, an intellectual whose tattooed quotes from
Nietzsche peek out seductively from under his button up.
GEORGE (CONT’D)
George. We had Civ last semester?
How you doing?
LIONEL
Grood...Gate...I’m ah..
GEORGE
Fan of your stuff. In the Observer?
LIONEL
No one reads the Observer.
GEORGE
You seen this?
George hands Lionel Sam’s “Missing Black Culture” flyer.
17.
GEORGE (CONT’D)
The residents of Armstrong / Parker
just made her head of house. Am I
crazy or is there a there there?
LIONEL
What made you come over here?
George holds up Sam’s “Ebony & Ivy.” Lionel takes it.
LIONEL (CONT’D)
I mean I’m glad you came --
GEORGE
-- My staff? God bless them.
They’re whiter than Michael
Jackson’s kids. We’re fucked if
anyone of them writes this story
and I will not let the transfers at
the Gazette do it first.
LIONEL
The oldest one has his face.
GEORGE
You’re in the Black Student Union.
You probably know Sam.
Lionel shakes his head “yes” and “no” at the same time.
GEORGE (CONT’D)
You come up with a good angle? I
want it in the Bugle.
Lionel eyes the bold “Bugle” logo on George’s shirt.
LIONEL
(aside)
Trumpet...
GEORGE
Bugle. Focus. The only paper on
campus with a national subscription
base and an Advisor from the New
York Times? Only so many ways a
person can distinguish themselves
at a place like this Lionel. You’re
good. You belong with us.
The way Lionel fights the smile creeping up his face - we
know he’s never heard these words. Never belonged any place.
Doesn’t hurt there’s a handsome boy smiling at him either.
18.
20 INT. ARMSTRONG/PARKER DINING HALL - DAY 20
Troy and Sam sit across from each other at a table. Their
opposite facing laptops and a world of tension put a wall
between them.
TROY
Get it yet?
Sam shakes her head yes.
TROY (CONT’D)
Good. You’ve now got the shared
calendar, contacts, and official
email.
Troy throws a smirk her way before pulling out a thick stack
of papers.
TROY (CONT’D)
Oh and before I forget.
SAM
Event requests for the year?
TROY
Just this month. They need your
approval. Also don’t forget to pick
your office hours. At least 20 per
week.
SAM
That’s absurd.
TROY
You’re in charge of a hundred
residents now. And they need time
to complain to your face. About
noise. Leaky pipes. Gluten free
options in the cafeteria. Etcetera.
SAM
Troy. I didn’t think I was going to
win.
TROY
And by the way petitioning the
President on the Randomization of
Housing Act isn’t gonna do shit.
None of the other houses are
concerned.
19.
SAM
Because they all have a legacy of
rich and powerful allies on the
board who will make sure that
“random” works out to their
advantage.
TROY
And you think a petition is going
to change that?
Troy gets up to leave as Reggie sits - suspicious. Sam’s
phone buzzes: “MOM.” The letters chill Sam to the core.
21 INT. ARMSTRONG / PARKER - DAY 21
Lionel steps his way through the hall, a deer in headlights
with a notepad. He flips through Sam’s “EBONY & IVY” book...
SAM (V.O.)
The Armstrong / Parker dining hall
is the epicenter of Black culture
as it stands at Manchester. Only
here can you commiserate, celebrate
and discuss everything from Kanye
West lyrics to theoretical
relativism all in one sitting. Not
to mention find someone who can
actually do your hair.
ARMSTRONG / PARKER DINING HALL - CONTINUOUS
Lionel enters and takes a place in a line. He absorbs this
lively and somewhat alien dining hall.
Troy now holds court near the windows at a table of eight or
so friends including Martin and SUNGMI, a lip ringed Korean
art major.
MARTIN
“We wuz robbed.” That election was
suspect man.
Martin glares at Reggie and his giant souped-up Laptop. Sam
breaks this by sitting back down - her phone call ending.
SAM
You call me the minute there’s an
update. Love you too mom.
Sam hangs up. The call’s really put her in a bad place. She
sits at a table of her Bofros - who we’ll name by their hair.
20.
CURLS
There is one other sister in my
Relativity class, I’ll be damned if
our professor doesn’t call me
Laretta every God damn time.
DREADS
We all look the same.
REGGIE
Programming professor gets me and
Martin here mixed up constantly.
MARTIN
You should be so lucky.
Reggie glances over at Martin’s Mac Air.
REGGIE
Cute. You get that at Toys R Us?
Sam pulls out her Mac and her student ID card.
REGGIE (CONT’D)
You still using your ID number?
SAM
I always forget passwords.
REGGIE
You are begging to get hacked.
SAM
Good thing the one evil technogenius
thinking like that is on my
side.
Sam pushes aside all the paperwork on her table.
SAM (CONT’D)
So this is what the revolution
looks like? Office hours and
paperwork.
Sam pulls her camera out - starts to shoot the room.
REGGIE
Winning was a happy accident. We
want the reform repealed right?
CURLS
Means to an end, sister.
21.
Sam feels the heat of her disciples’ eyes on her as the topic
of the day rages on with the entrance of Coco, who sits with
a group of well manicured hot-ironed group of girls, white
and Black.
COCO
The talented tenth always has to
bust its ass a little bit harder,
but I don’t see the benefit in
blaming white folks for everything.
CURLS
Who’s blaming?
TROY
I don’t see the issue. I never had
one. Never ran into any lynch mobs.
Lionel takes a seat alone facing the action.
Kurt and crew enter with plates of mac and cheese and sit in
the heart of the conversation. Lionel avoids eye contact.
SAM
Lynch mob is still there. Just rebranded
itself.
TROY
As what pray tell?
REGGIE
The Republican party.
SAM
Want to know how this world sees
you? Go to a Young Republican’s
meeting and bring up Welfare.
SUNGMI
Or Immigration.
LIONEL
(aside)
Or gay equality.
KURT
Bullshit.
MARTIN
I agree. Got something to add?
KURT
The biggest athletes, movie stars,
hell your president is Black.
22.
(MORE)
Sometimes I think the hardest thing
to be in the American work force
right now is an educated white guy.
SUNGMI
You’re not serious.
KURT
You guys still got affirmative
action, you’re set.
REGGIE
This shit.
SAM
What are you doing in here?
KURT
Obama. Leader of the free world got
into Harvard on affirmative action.
Know who’s not president right now?
The guy that didn’t get in.
SAM
On behalf of the colored folks in
the room, let me apologize for all
the better qualified white students
whose place we’re taking up.
Kurt chuckles - a bit turned on by the argument.
SAM (CONT’D)
You get lost? Bechet is that way.
KURT
Yeah but what other dining hall
gives you chicken and waffles? Dear
White People right? Funny stuff.
How haven’t we staffed you yet?
SAM
On Pastiche? Your uninspired humor
magazine?
KURT
We’re a lot more than a magazine
sweetie. SNL staff is basically
half Lampoon, half Pastiche. Just
like the network comedies.
A flash of envy comes over Troy and Coco.
23.
KURT (CONT'D)
SAM
What gives you Clubhouse kids the
right to come to our Dining Hall?
Kurt eats an exaggerated scoop of mac and cheese.
SAM (CONT’D)
You don’t live here.
MARTIN
Sam? What are you doing?
SAM
You can’t eat here.
Kurt eyes this new adversary. Enjoys a good challenge.
TROY
Chill Sam damn. Let the man--
KURT & SAM
-- I got this.
KURT
Who are you to put me out?
SAM
(realizing)
I’m the Head of this house. And I’m
doing things my way.
Sam shoots this last one to Martin. Kurt rolls his eyes to
which Sam slams his tray to the ground.
Lionel scribbles down notes furiously on a notepad.
KURT
You got any idea who you’re --
SAM
-- Yeah, I know who your daddy is.
The same one who’s been pushing to
break up this House for a decade.
What’s wrong? Is he scared letting
the Negroes gather in groups might
start a rebellion on the
plantation? You tell him from
me...he should be.
Kurt looks into Sam’s eyes and then his crew. They want out.
KURT
Bad move.
24.
Kurt leads his crew out of the dining hall drawing a slight
snicker from Lionel which draws Sam’s eyes right to him.
Something sparks in Lionel. He takes out his phone and texts
to GEORGE: “I’ve got the angle. I’m in.”
SAM
You too.
LIONEL
Me?
SAM
Is this your house?
Lionel sinks - the eyes of everyone in the room on him.
Sam sits back down as a trickle of claps grow to a steady
applause. Troy and his table look around baffled.
By the caution on Sam’s face it seems the first time she’s
ever heard this sound directed at her.
A slight envy boils in Coco.
One last look to the room from Lionel before he slips out.
Locked out again.
23 INT. COCO’S ROOM - DAY 23
Coco scrolls Sam’s “Dear White People” Youtube page. 75K
Subscribers. She presses play on the latest video.
SAM (O.S.)
Dear White People, stop dancing.
Two seconds. 600K views.
COCO
The fuck?
Coco exits and opens her own “TIME AT AN IVY LEAGUE” page. 2K
subscribers. Her latest video is at 10K views. Alright... She
presses record. Let’s the camera rest on her briefly...
COCO (CONT’D)
Muffins. I hate to do it, but Imma
have to get real Black with you.
(comes to mind)
So the other day, a girl had the
nerve to fix her mouth and ask me
if my hair was weaved.
(after a moment)
Weaved. Weaved bitch?
25.
(MORE)
First of all if you’re going to fix
your mouth to ask me something like
that, say it right please? It’s
weave. Noun. Present tense. Second
of all don’t assume just because
you see a sister with some hair
it’s a weave. Is it? Clearly. If a
bitch could grow straight Indian
hair directly out her own head I
wouldn’t have just overdrafted my
account paying for this shit but
that ain’t your business. Are those
your lips sweetie? Sweet heart is
that really your skin? These white
girls and these tans I swear to
God, they’re starting to look
darker than me.
Coco pauses it. Her mouse hovers over the check box next to
“private.” Instead she plays it back...and hits “publish.”
She clicks back through to Sam’s last video and hits “reply.”
As the red light on her computer’s web cam turns green...
COCO (CONT’D)
Dear White People. What do I think
about it?
24 INT. SCREENING ROOM - DAY 24
Sam with arms folded watches as Gabe (Sam’s caller from
earlier) presses play on a DVD. Horrified students watch...
...a Black and white 1920’s style silent movie, complete with
Dialogue Cards and dramatic PIANO MUSIC.
SERIES OF SHOTS - ON THE SCREEN
A) OBAMA speaks at a debate
B) DIALOGUE CARD: “We are the change that we seek.”
C) A FAMILY in white-face go ape-shit
D) DIALOGUE CARD: “HE’S READING OFF A TELEPROMPTER!!!!!!”
E) More intercut footage of Obama speaking with actors in
white-face reacting. Until...
F) DIALOGUE CARD: OBAMA WINS A SECOND TERM!
G) A WHITE-FACE CROWD goes nuts in the streets - scream into
camera - loot buildings and shoot themselves in the head.
26.
COCO (CONT’D)
H) Dialogue Card: “FIN”
PROFESSOR BODKIN, late 40s, with a “seen it all before”
demeanor hides a grin and lets the room settle.
PROFESSOR BODKIN
Okay. Does anyone have any comments
for Sam’s “Rebirth of a Nation?”
All of the kids are too scared to comment. Except...
PROFESSOR BODKIN (CONT’D)
Gabe, go ahead.
GABE
I dig the “silent movie” thing, but
it’s a little self-congratulatory.
Light on story and frankly
thematically dubious.
PROFESSOR BODKIN
Okay. Anybody else?
SAM
What?
SAME PLACE - MOMENTS LATER
As students filter out of the class...
PROFESSOR BODKIN
Sam?
SAM
Before you say anything might I
remind you that I sat through Birth
of A Nation, Gone With The Wind,
and Tarantino week without protest.
PROFESSOR BODKIN
And might I remind you that I read
all fifteen pages of your
unsolicited essay on why Gremlins
is actually about suburban white
fear of Black culture.
SAM
The Gremlins are loud, talk in
slang, are addicted to fried
chicken and freak out when you get
their hair wet.
27.
PRESIDENT BODKIN
My only problem with your movie is
that it was late. The silent
projects were last semester Sam.
You were supposed to have emailed
your sound treatment over Summer.
SAM
I’ve been getting footage.
PROFESSOR BODKIN
This is your senior thesis Sam,
where the hell is your head at?
SAM
I’ve got Radio, BSU, this Head of
House thing --
PROFESSOR BODKIN
-- Do you want this? Cause if not,
don’t waste my time here --
Sam pulls out the Super 8 camera from her satchel.
SAM
-- Look this thing might as well be
my right hand Professor. I was busy
this summer that’s all.
PROFESSOR BODKIN
With everything but your major?
While your peers are taking
internships, making short films...
SAM
My dad. He’s sick. Had to go home.
PROFESSOR BODKIN
If you need some time off, take it.
But if you want to make it to next
semester --
SAM
-- I do --
PROFESSOR BODKIN
-- Pull it together. This is
Manchester.
Sam wants this. It’s in her eyes as she holds her tongue.
25 EXT. MANCHESTER UNIVERSITY - DAY 25
Sam exits the theater and spots Gabe talking to some guys.
28.
SAM
Thematically dubious?
GABE
Well what was that supposed to be
about exactly?
SAM
You’re thematically dubious!
Gabe rolls his eyes and catches up with her.
SAM (CONT’D)
Since when do TA’s give critiques?
GABE
You invoke Minstrelsy for shock
value, but to what end?
SAM
To invoke the same feeling I get
when I turn on the TV and see some
so-called reality star shuck and
jive for ratings egged on by no
doubt white producers. Or the sassy
Black secretary with no backstory
or character development aside from
their skin color.
GABE
So it’s a tit for tat? *
EXT. GOODMAN MEDIA SCHOOL 2 - DAY *
SAM *
You’re honestly saying that art *
can’t be reactionary? *
GABE *
You’re reacting to a work made *
almost a hundred years ago. *
SAM *
Yes because fear of Black men being *
involved in the United States *
Government is a completely *
antiquated concept. No social *
relevance whatsoever today. *
GABE *
Frankly I just think sometimes its *
better to hold a mirror up to your *
audience than to drop an *
ideological piano over their head. *
29.
SAM *
Frankly I just think works that *
deal with the African Diaspora *
through a post-modern lens are *
outright rejected unless they’re *
handled by a white artist. *
GABE *
African Diaspora? Really? *
26 INT. DAVIS HOUSE - DAY 26
The war rages as the two continue up a fleet of stairs.
SAM
Blackface is alive and well in our
culture. Who primarily buys hip
hop? Watches Housewives of Atlanta?
The same homogenized images of
Black people over and over again?
White people Gabe.
GABE
Who goes to see Tyler Perry movies?
SAM
We’re an underfed community. None
of this changes the fact that the
vibrancy, the complexity of Black
culture has been distilled into
commodities and marketing schemes
to be bought and sold--
GABE
--to the detriment of the so called
“real thing.” Got it.
And into a room...
INT. GABE’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Gabe slams the door.
SAM
I am indistinguishable from the so
called “urban” images used to amuse
and market to white America.
GABE
And the commodification of culture
is uniquely oppressive to Black
people?
30.
Sam nods fervently as Gabe grabs and unbuttons her jeans.
GABE (CONT’D)
So when Kanye raps about Louis V
and Rolexes and Classical Art,
exactly what exploited pocket of
Black America are those references
being mined from?
Sam can’t get her shirt off fast enough.
SAM
On your knees.
Gabe kneels below frame as Sam closes her eyes in ecstacy.
CUT TO BLACK.
27A INT. GABE’S ROOM - EVENING 27A
Sam’s eyes pop open - a startled scream escapes her lips.
She’s surprised at first to see Gabe beside her in bed, the
outside spoon. They’re both naked. Her pompadour frayed.
GABE
What? You dream in “Cosby” again?
SAM
My hair was so straight. My sweater
so big. I told you about that?
Sam’s phone buzzes. Gabe grabs it and sees Reggie’s photo pop
up. He swallows his envy and hands it to Sam. She doesn’t
answer. Silence as it hits her voicemail.
GABE
Hey so...this whole “Head of House”
thing. Congrats?
SAM
Yeah, it's…it's.
GABE
Weird, right? Never took you as a
student politician...
Reggie’s photo again - New Voicemail. A regret in Sam’s eyes.
SAM
Yeah, well...
Sam rolls out of bed. Gabe thinks twice before he asks it.
31.
GABE
Sam? What are we doing?
She badly wants to give him the answer he wants. Instead...
SAM
Fucking.
28 INT. STUDIO BOOTH - DAY 28
Reggie stares at Sam with stars in his eyes as she
effortlessly addresses the campus in between bits of jazz.
SAM (V.O.)
Dear White People. Please stop
touching my hair.
29 INT. GARMIN CLUB HOUSE - DAY 29
Lionel at an ancient oak dining room table listens to the
broadcast over his laptop. Makes studious notations...
SAM (V.O.)
Does this look like a petting zoo
to you?
Lionel gets an IM: “George: Hey handsome, how’s the story?”
To which Lionel writes: “Going great sexy.” Lionel deletes
“sexy” and replaces it with “:)” before hitting send.
29A BAR DIVIDE 29A
Across from Lionel is Kurt flanked by his eager but self
conscious right hand GORDON - and MITCH, swagged out varsity
crew captain and connoisseur of all things Black culture.
They wear “PASTICHE” gear, hunch over a glowing iPad and
scroll through a series of student group photos in the
Yearbook. Kurt stares off into space, turns up the GANGSTA
RAP playing from a nearby blue tooth speaker.
Kurt pours shots of Jack which Gordon eyes with caution.
GORDON
Kurt it’s three.
MITCH
Y.O.L.O. my nigga!
Everyone takes the shot.
32.
GORDON
We don’t even have our new staff
yet. Why are we planning this?
KURT
Everyone wants to be on our staff
that’s the easy part.
MITCH
We’re going to make staff bids on
Game Night, and the RSVP’s are
through the roof for that.
KURT
Yeah but Halloween is our premiere
party. The waitlist is already a
hundred deep and it’s going to take
a lot to outdo this summer.
MITCH
Cinco de Mayo was epic.
INSERT:
A black and white photo of Kurt and crew dressed in Sombreros
and Mexican stereotypes at a wild pool party. The title
reads... PASTICHE PRESENTS “WETBACK”
GORDON
How about the Young Republicans?
KURT
Too close to the Tea-Party.
INSERT:
Photo of Kurt and crew dressed as famous female political
conservatives - brandishing rally signs with misspellings and
cups of tea. The title reads... “PASTICHE’S TEA PARTY”
MITCH
Yo we need an East vs West hip hop
party. Get the honeys in here.
GORDON
“The honeys?” You’re from Vermont.
KURT
Guys what’s the Pastiche motto?
GORDON
“Sharpen thy sword.”
33.
MITCH
Our motto is a euphemism for
masturbation?
GORDON
It’s a reminder that satire is the
weapon of reason. So who on campus
is being unreasonable?
MITCH
Sounds like a reminder of how gay
you are.
GORDON
Was that even a reasonable attempt
at a quip Mitch?
MITCH
Hey Gordon, say reasonable again.
SAM (O.S.)
Dear White People, knowing Lil’
Wayne lyrics no longer earns you an
Honorary Black Card. It just
reminds me how often you say the
word “nigga” when no one Black is
around as is required in reciting
said lyrics.
Kurt turns up his music and shoots Lionel a look, who plugs
headphones into his computer and looks down.
KURT
The hell does Sam think she is?
MITCH
Like Spike Lee and Oprah had a
pissed off baby.
Kurt shares a glance with Mitch and Gordon - they’re leaning
towards the same idea.
KURT
Could we?
GORDON
How?
Kurt turns his heat towards Lionel - has a bone to pick.
KURT
Hey Lionel. Talked to the Dean
today.
34.
(MORE)
We had a very enlightening
conversation. I just want to say...
I’m sorry about the voice message.
29B DINING ROOM 29B
Kurt and his crew cross over to Lionel’s table. Kurt unzips
his pants silently.
KURT (CONT’D)
Do you accept?
Lionel removes the headphones and turns to Kurt, just as he
starts flopping his dick around off screen. Lionel quickly
looks in the other direction. Kurt’s friends crack up.
GORDON
Please put that away.
KURT
You got to talk to these people in
a language they’ll understand.
Lionel shoves his headphones back on over his fro.
LIONEL
Pathetic.
KURT
(yelling)
Wherever he ships you off to, be
sure to pack a sense of humor with
you, kay bro?
Lionel drowns them out. He flips through Sam’s “Ebony & Ivy”
book to a section called...
SAM (V.O.)
The Paper Bag Tests.
As Lionel reads we swish pan to...
30 DREAM DINER 30
...an abstract Diner set. Sam at the counter addresses us.
SUPERIMPOSE: THE TIP TEST
SAM
The Tip Test. You hit up Jelly’s
for a snack. Your waitress mistakes
you for someone who looks like you
(Black) who once ran up a thirty
dollar bill and left a dollar tip.
35.
KURT (CONT'D)
WAITRESS, over it, crosses frame and glares coldly at us.
Lionel takes a seat at a booth with Sam across from him.
SAM (CONT’D)
You watch all the other customers
order before you do...
Waitress huffs her way over to Lionel.
LIONEL
Pastrami sandwich on rye.
SAM
...then proceed to wait no less
than forty minutes for your food.
A wall-clock advances forty, before the food and check come.
SAM (CONT’D)
How do you tip? A...
LIONEL
Forty minutes? Man she’s lucky I
leave her forty cents. You do a
good job, maybe you’ll see a tip.
SAM
B...
LIONEL
Doris was tripping, but fifteen
percent is the least I can do.
SAM
Or C...
LIONEL
I reject the stereotype that
African American’s don’t tip. I’m
leaving her twenty, no twenty five,
just to prove I can!
CUT TO:
Lionel’s back in reality. He ponders the scenario.
LIONEL (CONT’D)
C?
He turns the book upside down and reads the small print on
the bottom of the page. “A) ONE HUNDRED” “B) OOFTA” and his
answer “C) NOSE-JOB.”
36.
LIONEL (CONT’D)
Nose-job?
31 EXT. MANCHESTER UNIVERSITY - DAY 31
The campus has settled into the semester as students trudge
back and forth to class.
SAM (V.O.)
Dear White People in a shocking
reversal using the term “African
American” is borderline racist now.
32 INT. DEAN FAIRBANKS OFFICE - DAY 32
Dean Fairbanks and PRESIDENT HERBERT FLETCHER, 50’s in an
even better suit than Fairbanks listen to the radio.
Fairbanks eyeballs Fletcher - tension between the two.
SAM (O.S.)
Turns out if you’re too worried
about Political Correctness to say
“Black”, odds are you secretly just
want to call us niggers anyway and
truth be told I’d rather you just
be honest about it.
PRESIDENT FLETCHER
Free speech my ass.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
Stalin quotes for two hundred?
PRESIDENT FLETCHER
You’re joking about this?
DEAN FAIRBANKS
I’m sorry, was I supposed to take
“Free speech my ass” as a
legitimate suggestion?
PRESIDENT FLETCHER
This is your office’s issue Walter.
Especially after that episode with
Kurt in the dining hall.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
Every race issue is my issue.
PRESIDENT FLETCHER
It’s a student issue. You are the
Dean of students aren’t you?
The two share an old and heated glare.
37.
PRESIDENT FLETCHER (CONT’D)
The Times has been watching us like
a hawk. Last thing we need is some
“race war” on newspapers across the
country. How do you think our donor
base will feel about that? Our fundraiser
is four weeks away.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
How bad is this deficit of yours?
PRESIDENT FLETCHER
Worse. But let me tell you
something. If this blows up any
further? It’s on you Walter. Racism
is over in America. And if anyone’s
still dealing with it, it’s the --
I don’t know Mexicans probably.
Troy pokes his head in. Fairbanks cuts the radio off.
PRESIDENT FLETCHER (CONT’D)
Come on in.
TROY
President Fletcher.
PRESIDENT FLETCHER
Son, call me Herb.
Fairbanks grits his teeth as Fletcher exits and Troy sits.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
President Fletcher tells me his son
got his ass handed to him.
Troy hates this game.
DEAN FAIRBANKS (CONT’D)
Bout time. Can’t tell you how many
instances I had to defend Armstrong
/ Parker when I was Head of House.
TROY
Sam’s out of line. Kurt’s alright.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
But you’re supposed to be better
than alright. Since when do we lose
elections Troy?
TROY
The Housing Act passing without a
fight didn’t help.
38.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
What have I told you about excuses?
TROY
Pops my course load is full anyway.
I’m head of Econ Board, I’m
thinking about Pastiche.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
Pastiche? On Kurt Fletcher’s staff?
TROY
You know to round out the res?
DEAN FAIRBANKS
I’ll be God damned if twenty years
from now you have to end up working
for that dumb asses son.
TROY
(put in his place)
Yes sir.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
Fletcher and I graduated a year
apart. He barely made it through. I
graduated Summa cum Laude. Now look
who’s President and who’s Dean.
TROY
What’s the difference?
DEAN FAIRBANKS
A couple hundred grand a year.
Understand what I’m saying? Now
what happened between you and Sam
to make her come after you anyway?
TROY
Sofia. You remember Sofia? Daughter
of the President. Psych major. “Has
the world ahead of her Troy.”
DEAN FAIRBANKS
I don’t like your tone boy.
TROY
Sorry sir.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
So you lost the House. On to the
school presidency then.
The light in Troy’s eyes dims a bit.
39.
DEAN FAIRBANKS (CONT’D)
It’ll be good to show this campus
is capable of electing someone like
you as school president.
TROY
Someone like me?
33 INT. TROY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT 33
Troy hovers over the toilet - smokes weed while the shower
runs - exhales through his paper towel / dryer sheet
apparatus. He jots down on a notepad and LAUGHS to himself.
TROY’S APARTMENT - SAME TIME
Sofia has her face to the floor - peering underneath the
bathroom door. She can see Troy’s feet. What the hell?
Off the SQUEAK of the shower being cut Sofia jumps up.
MOMENTS LATER
Troy bounds out the bathroom in his undies. Sofia on the
couch pretends to have been watching television.
TROY
Babe. Hat or no hat?
Troy stands before her in his undies holding a Kangol. He
eyes her oversized T-shirt.
TROY (CONT’D)
Are you wearing that?
SOFIA
I don’t have to be.
Sofia yanks Troy to her by his underwear to kiss his navel.
SOFIA (CONT’D)
Hey boo...why don’t we put some of
your new found free time to good
use? It’s been a while since...
TROY
What’s with all this boo stuff?
SOFIA
...since you fucked me with your
big Black cock.
Troy pulls away.
40.
SOFIA (CONT’D)
It used to turn you on when I
talked like that. Is it me?
TROY
(yes)
I love you.
SOFIA
Is it Sam?
TROY
Can we please just, get ready?
SOFIA
Why? I hate my brother’s friends.
Troy thinks over his next words carefully.
TROY
You’re not going to go with me?
SOFIA
You’d go without me?
Troy tries to flash a charming shrug.
SOFIA (CONT’D)
You’re my guest!
Sofia gathers some books and heads for the door.
TROY
You can hang out while I’m --
SOFIA
-- Okay, what’s with you and my
brother? Are you in love with him?
Is this like, some DL shit?
Sofia storms out.
TROY
“DL shit!?”
34 INT. FOREST - NIGHT 34
Lionel walks up the darkly lit stairs of a very old building.
He reaches a door marked “Newsroom.”
35 INT. NEWSROOM - NIGHT 35
Lionel looks around the dimmed office. There is music and
light coming from a room past all the cubicles...
41.
36 INT. BULLPEN - NIGHT 36
...An office filled with computers. George and a few other
EDITORS scream with laughter - beers and pizza in hand.
GEORGE does a beat on his desk while...
GEORGE
I keeps it clean
Ya know what I mean.
I drinks my Vodka straight,
like I’m a fiend.
ANNIE, a strawberry blonde laughs in George’s lap. Lionel’s
envy shows.
ANNIE
Wait, quiet I want to hear this.
Annie turns up a Youtube video of...
COCO (O.S.)
If I could grow straight Indian
hair out my head --
ANNIE
Ohmigod, this is going on Facebook.
Annie swivels in her chair only to SCREAM BLOODY MURDER at
the sight of Lionel.
LIONEL
Relax the Negro at the door is not
here to rape you.
Annie laughs. The mood is drunk and light.
LIONEL (CONT’D)
So this is what editors do?
GEORGE
We’re taking a break, what are you
doing here?
LIONEL
You wanted me to drop in and tell
you how the story was coming?
GEORGE
Yeah like this week. It’s Saturday
night. You got nowhere else to be?
LIONEL
It was this or the new Madea movie.
42.
GEORGE
Dear God. Where does Madea go this
time? Dialysis?
37 EXT. MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT 37
Sam, flanked by Reggie and the BoFros are in mid rant.
REGGIE
Man fuck Tyler Perry.
SAM
Like, can we have a movie with, you
know characters in them? ‘Stead of
stereotypes wrapped in Christian
dogma?
REGGIE
Why is every educated person
inherently evil? Why this Nigga
gotta be in a mutha fucking dress
all the mutha fucking time?
SAM
How come the only Black movies
Hollywood wants to make are ones
with mammies in fat suits or Black
women in pain man?
All of this is directed at a TEENAGER in the box office.
TEENAGER
Most people are here to see Fang 9.
(after a beat)
Kelly Rowland’s in it?
The group throw up their hands and groan in protest.
38 INT. KURT’S HOUSE - NIGHT 38
Game Night and Kurt’s house is filled with smoke, music, and
rich kids who play cards at various tables.
Coco, in a banging jumpsuit scans the room for prospects. A
few eyes from the WHITE BOYS start to flicker her way. This
perks her up, as she arches her back slightly...
...only to see their eyes follow the WHITE BRUNETTE HIPSTER
GIRL who has entered behind her.
Coco catches herself in the mirror. What don’t they see?
38A CARD TABLE 38A
43.
Troy deals cards at a table - the game is Texas Hold Em. Troy
holds court - much to Kurt’s chagrin. The mood is playful.
There’s a brief eye contact between Troy and Coco.
39 INT. SAM’S APARTMENT - NIGHT 39
A huge “Boycott Sal’s Pizzeria” poster hangs on the walls of
Sam’s chic dorm surrounded by other street art. The BoFros
and a few cool residents of Armstrong / Parker hang about.
Underground hip hop permeates the room. Sam refuses a joint
coldly from Reggie - her eyes fixed on “SCHOOL DAZE” which
plays on her 36’ flatscreen.
SAM
How ‘bout you stop stereotyping
yourself and put that shit out?
This ain’t “Friday.”
REGGIE
Yo Sam. We got to talk about the
protest. When are we are bringing
the Housing fight to the prez?
Sungmi takes a seat next to Sam. Some kids hop up and start
grooving it out when a new song pops up on the playlist.
SUNGMI
The House voted down sponsoring the
rally.
REGGIE
What do we need it sponsored for?
SAM
Demonstrations can get shut down if
a House doesn’t sponsor them.
REGGIE
Like the House you’re head of?
Sam shoots Reggie a glare. He backs off.
SUNGMI
Hey Sam, I read “Ebony and Ivy.”
What’s with the Oofta, Nose-Jobs,
One Hundred stuff? I miss
something?
Sam smiles.
SAM
You want me to break it down?
44.
40 INT. KURT’S HOUSE - NIGHT 40
Troy deals another hand with Kurt, Mitch and Gordon. Troy’s
homeboy swag is thicker than usual.
MITCH
Yo my perfect Friday night is
whiskey and my T-Bone Walker
records, real talk.
TROY
Who the fuck is T-Bone Walker?
40A INTERCUT WITH SAM’S APARTMENT: 40A
SAM
Only a few ways colored folks
survive at a place like this.
MITCH
Uh only a pioneer of electric and
jump blues bro. Know your roots.
TROY
White folks always be on stuff like
decades too late and act like they
discovered some shit.
SAM
“Oofta” is the jazz age term for
Bojangle types who Blacked it up
for White audiences.
MITCH
Don’t sleep on T-Bone man.
TROY
Rock, Jazz, Blues - Nigga whatchu
got on right now?
MITCH
Public Enemy my Nig--
TROY
--Yo watch that man.
GORDON
You just called him --
TROY
-- Ya’ll get Country Clubs we get
to say Nigga.
Everyone at the table erupts in laughter. Except Kurt.
45.
GORDON
And golf? And all our girls?
TROY
Whatchu mean all your girls?
GORDON
Dude, between OJ, Tiger, Wesley
Snipes and uh, Troy over here...
TROY
Yo. It’s a word for that.
Reparations.
More Kurt-less laughter from the table.
TROY (CONT’D)
Forty white bitches and a mule.
Perfectly executed. Troy grins as the table erupts.
SAM
An Oofta modulates his Blackness up
or down depending on the crowd and
what he wants from them.
MITCH
Kurt?
KURT
What?
GORDON
Kurt.
Troy watches this exchange closely.
GORDON (CONT’D)
Troy. You thinking about Pastiche?
TROY
That’s the magazine right?
GORDON
For starters.
MITCH
What other “magazine” you know has
a first look deal at NBC? The third
biggest Youtube channel. Talk show.
Platinum comedy record homie!
46.
GORDON
Couldn’t you see him on the talk
show Kurt?
Kurt looks at his cards.
KURT
I fold.
41 INT. SAM’S APARTMENT - NIGHT 41
A small crowd’s formed around Sam.
SUNGMI
Okay, and a nose-job is a wannabe?
42 INT. KURT’S HOUSE - NIGHT 42
Coco finishes her drink and catches Mitch and Gordon as they
start up a Youtube video on their iPad. The previous game is
over. They watch “Dear White People - 1,378,480 views.”
42A INTERCUT WITH SAM’S APARTMENT: 42A
SAM
Sort of. Nose-jobs smooth their
Black edges and try to blend.
Coco runs her fingers through her straight hair.
GORDON
You seen this one?
SAM (YOUTUBE)
Dear White People using Instagram.
You have an iPhone and go on hikes.
I get it.
COCO
Ugh.
Gordon and Mitch turn and notice Coco. Mitch eyes her curves.
GORDON
Not a fan?
Coco makes a “no” face.
MITCH
Sup ma?
COCO
Don’t talk like that.
47.
GORDON
Hey I know you...
Coco is taken aback as Gordon punches up her video and plays
it back. She hovers over them.
COCO (YOUTUBE)
Muffins. I hate to do it, but Imma
have to get real Black with you.
Coco a bit embarrassed scans the view count.
SAM
A Nose-job’s worst fear is that
their “Blackness” might cause a
fuss or draw undue attention so
they apologize for it or use it to
self deprecate.
COCO
Forty thousand views already?
GORDON
Looks like someone submitted you to
Buzzfeed. Taking off...
Coco leans over them and scrolls down. The first comment is
from a HELMUT: “Much better...” Coco soaks this in.
MITCH
You wan’ a drink a sun’in?
COCO
Let me guess you’re from Ohio?
MITCH
Vermont.
GORDON
What do you have against Dear White
People?
Coco smiles and slyly clicks to her next video.
COCO (YOUTUBE)
Dear White People. How do I feel
about it? Well for one it’s Blacker
than thou propaganda from a bougie
Lisa Bonet wannabe who smells like
patchouli and frankly I can’t
believe we’re letting Sam get away
with it.
48.
Mitch and Gordon’s mouths are ajar. Coco studies the view
count...26,758. A pride strikes Coco.
43 INT. SAM’S APARTMENT - NIGHT 43
As the impromptu party dies down...
SUNGMI
Okay and One Hundred?
REGGIE
Keeping it One-Hundred! Being Black
as hell just cause.
Sam rolls her eyes.
SUNGMI
But what about just being you?
SAM
Like I said...
44 INT. NEWSROOM - NIGHT 44
Lionel’s got the eyes of the Bullpen on him. Annie’s really
warmed to him - her hands play with his afro.
ANNIE
You don’t mind do you?
SAM (V.O.)
There’s only a few ways a person of
a color can survive at a place like
this...
LIONEL
Of course not.
GEORGE
Alright so then what?
LIONEL
So then Sam says “What, is your
daddy scared the Negroes are gonna
start a rebellion on the
plantation?”
George goes CRAZY at this.
GEORGE
To Kurt Fletcher!?
LIONEL
Yeah. Yes. Yup.
49.
GEORGE
We’ve got a news item but there’s
something bigger here. It’s a
profile piece on Armstrong / Parker
and Sam White’s pseudo revolution.
ANNIE
What’s the headline?
LIONEL
Outdated nationalist seeks purpose
starts race war?
Lionel’s joke hits, but he feels gross for saying it.
The image of Sam shaking her head in the dinner FLASHES
before Lionel briefly.
GEORGE
Beers in the corner. Bang out the
news item tonight and we’ll work on
the profile piece for next week.
Lionel grabs a beer and takes a seat at one of the open
computers. George starts up a beat on his desk as he and
Annie stare at Lionel expectantly.
LIONEL
What are you doing?
ANNIE
All Bugle staffer must freestyle.
It’s law.
GEORGE
You want to be a staffer right?
LIONEL
(awkward)
My name is Lionel
Kind of like a lion
King of the jungle
Indigenous to Africa...
The beat has long since stopped.
LIONEL (CONT’D)
Sorry.
45 INT. KURT’S KITCHEN - NIGHT 45
Troy heads into the kitchen just as Kurt heads out.
50.
TROY
Yo man, you know I wasn’t talking
about Sof back there with whole
forty bitches thing. I was just --
KURT
-- trying to get on my staff?
TROY
I never really thought about --
KURT
-- Bullshit. Game Night is where we
make our bids for the new staff.
It’s why everyone’s here. You were
practically about to bust out a tap
dance.
TROY
I’m a Poly Sci major man. I just
came to hang out.
KURT
My staff likes you. A lot.
TROY
But you don’t.
KURT
This thing with you and Sof...
TROY
I’m good to her.
KURT
Our dad’s have been playing a game
of chess off and on since 1972.
TROY
What and Sof is the White queen?
KURT
You’re a pawn. And I think it’s
time you get off the board bro.
Troy takes this in.
KURT (CONT’D)
Here’s the deal. Every year we
throw a party. The point is to mock
the self important and moronic
entities of the campus. The way to
get staffed is to write an invite
for the party.
51.
(MORE)
Our invites are legendary, we make
Gawker, the Post, tons of blogs
every year. If your invite is the
one that goes out, you’re
guaranteed a spot on the staff. The
runners up are voted on by the rest
of us.
Troy catches eyes with Coco who gives him a seductive glance.
45A LIVING ROOM 45A
Coco turns back to her now enamored crowd. She’s in her
element with these boys at her feet.
COCO
I just think having good hair and
carrying on with a degree of
sophistication doesn’t make me a
traitor to the race.
MITCH
Want to know why they used to call
me Black Mitch?
GORDON
Absolutely not.
COCO
No one called you that.
KITCHEN
Just as Gordon, Mitch and Coco approach...
TROY
Okay. And what’s this year’s theme?
Kurt rolls his eyes instinctively.
KURT
Still working on that...
TROY
The party’s a couple weeks away.
GORDON
Yo Kurt. I want you to meet
someone.
COCO
You guys got a party coming up?
Coco smiles at Kurt, before flicking her eyes over Troy.
52.
KURT (CONT’D)
46 INT. SAM’S APARTMENT - NIGHT 46
Sungmi is one of the last to clear out of Sam’s apartment as
the party winds down.
SUNGMI
Hey, about the rally. You could
still get the permit anyway Sam and
go against the board. Most people
consider that political suicide
though.
REGGIE
We got to rally Sam. Time is now.
SAM
Use your head Reggie. You think a
rally is going to change things?
REGGIE
It’ll do a hell of a lot more than
a radio show or views on Youtube.
Everyone gets quiet. Sungmi takes this time to exit.
REGGIE (CONT’D)
Look, we got power Sam and it’s
time we used it. We earned it.
SAM
We? I didn’t see you running for
shit Reggie.
The Bofros trade looks as Reggie storms out. Sam waits a beat
and rolls her eyes.
47 EXT. ARMSTRONG / PARKER QUAD - NIGHT 47
Sam walks after Reggie.
REGGIE
Tired.
SAM
Don’t “one word” me.
REGGIE
Why you got to snap at me all the
time? I’m around you like twenty
four seven. Like your lap dog. I
don’t even usually get down like
that with no red bone chicks man.
53.
SAM
Don’t call me that.
REGGIE
Come on, I thought your ass was
Puerto Rican when I met you.
Sam turns to go.
REGGIE (CONT’D)
Oh so you can dish it out but you
can’t take it?
SAM
I’m taking my ass home.
REGGIE
Come on Sam. You know how I feel
about you.
SAM
How am I supposed to know how you
feel about me?
REGGIE
You know what? Forgive me if I see
something in you. Something
inspiring. Something folks like me
can get behind.
Reggie puts his hands on Sam’s belt and pulls her in to a
kiss as a group walks by. Over Reggie’s shoulder Sam sees...
...Gabe look back at her. He’s heartbroken. She pretends not
to be affected and sinks into a kiss from Reggie.
REGGIE (CONT’D)
Tell me you’ll set up the rally.
SAM
I’ll set up the rally.
48 INT. KURT’S KITCHEN - NIGHT 48
Kurt, Gordon, Mitch, Coco and Troy all trade glances.
GORDON
Are we sure about this?
KURT
It’s ironic. Bold. And don’t tell
me I’m the only one who thinks Sam
White’s little movement needs to
get cut down to size.
54.
Agreement Coco’s gaze. Uncertainty in Troy’s.
KURT (CONT’D)
Looks like you got your Hip Hop
party Mitch.
MITCH
‘Bout time. It’s going to be huge
man, fucking epic.
Kurt holds back a smile.
KURT
Boys, we’ve got a lot more mingling
to do. We’ll be in touch. And Troy?
Get off the board bro.
Troy chews on this as Kurt leads his group out. Troy smiles,
goes to exit.
TROY
Nice seeing you.
COCO
Where’s Sofia?
TROY
I have no idea.
COCO
Trouble in paradise?
Troy shrugs and heads to the party.
COCO (CONT’D)
Figures.
(off Troy’s
incredulousness)
Nothing. I’m sure you’ve got
something else fair and petite
and...fair lined up for that drink.
TROY
What’s that supposed to mean?
COCO
It’s fine. I’m not even really into
Black dudes anyway.
TROY
I’ll have you know I’m an equal
opportunity employer, okay?
55.
COCO
And what kind of jobs are you
hiring for mister?
Coco’s stiletto rubs the side of Troy’s calf.
TROY
Aren’t you and Sofia --
COCO
-- I’m an accessory to Sofia. Can’t
ever shake the feeling I’m an
assignment for that Afro Studies
Minor of hers.
Troy nervously glances out at the crowd and then back towards
this dangerous and tempting creature before him.
COCO (CONT’D)
I’m sure you have no idea what I
mean.
49 EXT. MANCHESTER YARD - NIGHT 49
Lionel and George walk through the campus at night. George
waves goodbye to Annie as they pass Bechet House.
LIONEL
She seems really cool.
George just smiles.
GEORGE
Did we go too far? You’re in
Armstrong/Parker right?
LIONEL
No. Garmin.
GEORGE
Fancy.
LIONEL
George I’m not exactly down with
Sam and I’m not in the BSU. I got
kicked out of Armstrong / Parker
same as Kurt. But I’m going to
write a good story, okay?
GEORGE
I hope so. I want a Bugle on your
chest by the end of the month.
Lionel fights a smile as his heart beats through his chest.
56.
They reach the front of Lionel’s house. George runs his hand
through Lionel’s hair. Mitch, smoking on the porch with some
other kids - trade glances.
GEORGE (CONT’D)
Your fro’s so gnarly.
LIONEL
I’m growing it out.
GEORGE
Night Lionel.
Lionel heads up his stoop - past the snickers and glares of
Mitch and company.
MITCH
Party’s not over.
LIONEL
I live here.
MITCH
Sorry bro. Invitation only.
LIONEL
It’s two in the morning.
Mitch shrugs as humiliation floods over Lionel.
Lionel sighs and slumps on the steps outside the door. He
scrolls through his phone for a contact...OFFICE OF THE DEAN.
Starts an email.
50 INT. TROY’S BEDROOM - MORNING 50
Troy’s Kangol sits in the ground, besides his undies, and
besides a bright pink thong.
Coco’s pink painted finger nails travel through the creases
of Troy’s immaculate abs.
TROY
Coco huh?
COCO
Colandrea doesn’t exactly pass the
resume test, you know? I mean
couldn’t you fucking die? My
parents should’ve just named me
Ghetto-ass-hoodrat-anisha. Do
you...indulge?
Coco fiddles in her purse - pulls out a joint.
57.
TROY
It’s ten am.
Coco lights it and takes a drag. She hands it to Troy.
TROY (CONT’D)
I don’t mess with that stuff.
Coco sees right through him as Troy hits it like a pro.
COCO
Sure about that?
TROY
Sure you don’t like Black guys?
COCO
Girl like me is just a placeholder
for ya’ll at a place like this.
TROY
I’m not like that.
COCO
I don’t think Sam would agree.
TROY
That was different.
COCO
No it wasn’t. Poor thing, she was
light skin-ded and everything.
TROY
Yo, it wasn’t like that alright?
Troy’s tone sobers Coco a bit. She places a hand on Troy’s.
TROY (CONT’D)
My pops. He wanted me with
Fletcher’s daughter. They’ve been
in competition ever since they went
here. Pops hates that Fletcher
ended up President and he got stuck
as the Dean.
COCO
So your upbringing may have
actually fucked you up more than
mine? That’s hot.
Troy laughs and takes the joint back.
58.
COCO (CONT’D)
The hell is the difference between
a Dean and a President anyway?
TROY
Apparently four hundred years of
unreconciled oppression.
COCO
He’s not going to like you running
with the Pastiche boys is he?
TROY
If I even get tapped.
COCO
You will. And you should do it.
They all land somewhere big, some
before they even graduate. I’ve
seen you in front of a crowd Troy.
I bet you could be famous.
TROY
That what you want? To be famous?
COCO
I want people to know my name.
TROY
Which one?
Coco’s phone buzzes with a message. It’s Kurt.
COCO
(reading)
We want you. Come by Ellington
tomorrow at eight.
(to Troy)
Anything?
Troy checks his phone. Nothing. A decision weighs in Troy’s
eyes as Coco throws on a shirt and gets up to go.
COCO (CONT’D)
You’re going to have to stand up to
him sooner or later Troy.
52 EXT. ARMSTRONG / PARKER QUAD - DAY 52
Troy and Sofia stand still amidst the bustle. Devastation
marks her pretty face.
SOFIA
You said you loved me.
59.
TROY
I like you a lot.
Salt meet wound. She wants to go, but something nags at her.
SOFIA
What do you do in the bathroom?
When you leave the shower running?
Was it just to get away from me?
Troy wagers his answer and decides to confess.
TROY
I smoke weed and write jokes.
Puzzled by the man before her and too hurt for more, Sofia
just turns and walks away. Troy watches her go just as...
...Lionel passes by. The two share an awkward glance before
Troy turns to enter the house.
53 INT. ARMSTRONG / PARKER HALL - SAME TIME 53
Lionel shyly trudges down the hall of Armstrong / Parker. He
turns to see Troy behind him. The two avoid the other’s gaze.
As they both head up the stairs, Troy notes it strange that
they’re headed in the same direction.
53A UPSTAIRS 53A
Lionel heads to a door at the end of the hallway and opens it
with a key. Troy’s already at the door when he looks up and
realizes Lionel’s just entered his apartment.
54 INT. TROY’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 54
TROY
The hell are you doing?
LIONEL & TROY
This is my apartment.
TROY
The hell it is.
LIONEL
The Dean said it was the only
opening.
TROY
Head of House doesn’t share.
60.
LIONEL
But you’re not Head of House.
Still stings. Troy heads into his room and closes the door
leaving Lionel alone in the living room.
57 INT. ARMSTRONG/PARKER DINING HALL - DAY 57
Lionel sits alone in front of another bowl of soup. Eyes the
different cliques of mostly Black students. Dreads walks past
and shoots a head nod. Lionel uncomfortably shoots one back.
DREADS
Stay Black, my brother.
LIONEL
Sure thing?
Lionel watches as Kurt and Troy walk together towards the
entrance - suddenly chums. Troy’s getting good news and
gladly shakes Kurt’s hand.
KURT
Need your submission by Thursday.
TROY
You got it bro.
The two try and enter, when immediately Dreads slams a GONG
in the back of the hall - prompting the whole of the dining
hall to turn and throw paper balls at Kurt.
KURT
The fuck?
Sam grins from a table comprised of Martin, Sungmi and her
other support staff. Martin is visibly annoyed.
TROY
Yo!
Troy takes some of the brunt of this and walks with the
humiliated Kurt back out of the Dining Hall.
Lionel watches with a smirk as Troy talks Kurt down on the
other side of the entrance. Lionel catches eyes with Sam
briefly who shares the same smirk.
He realizes Sam’s actually looking at Reggie, perched behind
him at a table flanked by Curls and Dreads. They address him.
REGGIE
Finally made it in.
61.
DREADS
Been moved around a lot right?
CURLS
You must have been terrified when
you saw “Armstrong/Parker” written
on your moving assignment.
LIONEL
I was just finishing up.
REGGIE
Do Black people scare you?
LIONEL
(realizing its true)
No.
REGGIE
You’re too scared to even ask
anyone for a cut.
LIONEL
I’m growing it out.
DREADS
No. I’m growing it out. You’re
fostering an ecosystem.
REGGIE
How come you don’t come to BSU?
LIONEL
I listen to Mumford and Sons and
watch Robert Altman movies. You
honestly think I’m Black enough for
the union?
DREADS
Yo, I love Robert Altman. Mutha
fucka goes in.
CURLS
(after a beat)
We’re not all homophobes you know.
Black folks?
Lionel’s eyes dart around. How did she know?
DREADS
I’m bumping Frank Ocean right now.
I don’t give a fuck. Imma still eat
at Chik Fil A though. Them nuggets
good as hell.
62.
LIONEL
I’m late for class.
REGGIE
You’re the “Black voice” of the
Bugle now. We’re just trying to
decide if you are friend or foe.
Reggie pulls a folded copy of the Bugle from under his arm.
Sam’s on the front page with the headline “WHITE STUDENTS
TOLD TO ‘GET OUT’ BY LIONEL HIGGINS.”
REGGIE (CONT’D)
We got to protect our girl.
Reggie motions over to a stressed out Sam as she argues over
something with Martin at another table.
LIONEL
I’m not on staff. Not until I make
good on my assignment, I’m just --
REGGIE
-- Assignment? What’s the story?
LIONEL
They want me to do a profile piece
on Black culture at Manchester.
REGGIE
Of which you are so clearly an
expert.
Shame floods Lionel’s face.
REGGIE (CONT’D)
So what’s harder man? Being Black
enough for the Black kids or the
white ones?
LIONEL
Being neither.
Another GONG sounds with another shower of paper balls. This
time it’s for...
...Gabe, who’s stuck outside. He makes eye contact with...
GABE
Sam! Really Sam?
She just looks away. Reggie eyes him coolly.
63.
58 INT. CLASSROOM - DAY 58
Professor Bodkin watches over a small class as the students
fill in essay questions. Sam’s eyes are glued to a window...
Outside below the Brofros pull up in an SUV. They hop out and
start pulling out rally signs and bullhorns.
Sam’s eyes dart back to the clock as Gabe watches her watch
the time.
59A EXT. MANCHESTER UNIVERSITY - DAY 59A
Sam bounds out of a building on her way to the parking lot.
From behind her...
DEAN FAIRBANKS
Running late.
Sam pauses and turns to see him.
DEAN FAIRBANKS (CONT’D)
For your little rally?
SAM
Forget your sign Dean?
DEAN FAIRBANKS
Do you honestly think this is in
the spirit of Armstrong / Parker
house?
SAM
The role of the counter culture is
to wake up the mainstream to --
DEAN FAIRBANKS
-- I’ve got furniture older than
you. Counter culture? Is that what
you think this is? That show of
yours?
SAM
What about my show?
DEAN FAIRBANKS
Your show is racist.
SAM
Black people can’t be racist.
The Dean is rendered speechless at this statement.
64.
SAM (CONT’D)
Prejudice? Yes. But not racist.
Racism describes a system of
disadvantage based on race. Black
people can’t be racist since they
don’t benefit from such a system.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
Do you read the school papers?
SAM
Is the New York Times a school
paper?
DEAN FAIRBANKS
Your antics are making press Sam
and press like this keeps men like
President Fletcher up at night.
SAM
Warm milk?
DEAN FAIRBANKS
He’s building a file on you.
SAM
It’s not my fault your son couldn’t
beat me in an election.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
I’m sure it was hard growing up.
Wondering which side you fit into.
Feeling like you have to
overcompensate perhaps?
SAM
If that’s true, I’m not the only
one Dean.
Sam walks off in a half jog - Fairbank’s last words resonate
more than she’d like.
Gabe, making his way outside just catches her exit.
59B EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY 59B
Huge canvas signs with the words “WHITES ONLY” are strewn
about the pavement, along with bullhorns and picket signs.
Sam takes these in while the Brofros feverishly unpack the
SUV.
65.
REGGIE
There you are! We supposed to start
at noon.
SAM
I told you I had class.
There’s a vibration in Sam’s pocket. Her phone says “MOM.”
She cuts it off and picks up a “white’s only” sign.
REGGIE
Those are going up on Gillespie.
Good right?
Sam shrugs in the affirmative but it’s too much. Reggie sees
a doubt in her eyes.
REGGIE (CONT’D)
Yo. What’s that? You’re not getting
cold feet are you?
SAM
No. I mean how long do I have to
talk anyway?
REGGIE
You’re kidding right? You’re sort
of the keynote.
SAM
Yeah but...you know I think the
whole Malcolm X thing is your lane
Reg. I’m just not --
REGGIE
-- They came to hear you Sam. Grab
a bullhorn. Turn it on.
Sam is struck by the command. Stuck between wanting to curse
and comply another buzz in her pocket yanks her attention to
her phone. Sam checks: “IT’S ABOUT DAD. CALL ME”
Sam turns for some privacy. She makes eye contact with Gabe
who’s just happened upon the parking lot.
GABE
What is all this?
SAM
(on phone)
Hey. In the middle of--
-- Okay. Okay. Okay.
66.
Tears well up in Sam’s eyes as she shakes her head no and
heads away from the parking lot and passed Gabe.
When Reggie looks up and catches eyes with Sam. His tilted
look of indignation asks her what she’s doing.
REGGIE
Sam?
Sam takes in the scene and decisively turns to go. Reggie’s
heart sinks as a bewildered Gabe goes to chase after her.
REGGIE (CONT’D)
Sam!
60 INT. ARMSTRONG / PARKER HALL - DAY 60
Reggie flanked by the BoFros bangs on Sam’s door.
REGGIE
Yo, what the hell Sam?
61 INT. SAM’S ROOM - DAY 61
The banging continues as Sam sits on the edge of her bed. The
tears have dried. Gabe paces behind the bed.
GABE
You want me to tell them to go?
SAM
You’re so tough.
GABE
I will.
SAM
I want you to wait until they’ve
gone and then head home.
GABE
I’m trying to be here for you.
SAM
Can you be somewhere else for me?
61A HALLWAY 61A
REGGIE
Sam! I know you’re home.
67.
61B SAM’S ROOM 61B
GABE
What do you see in him?
SAM
The only eligible single brother on
campus.
GABE
Wow. Okay.
SAM
I get it. Your parents owned in
Harlem or something? You watched
“Do The Right Thing” in high school
and you want to prove to the world
you’re down?
GABE
I want to be down? How long does it
take to get your hair like that?
REGGIE (O.S.)
Sam. We want to talk.
SAM
Reggie I will call you later damn!
(to Gabe)
You don’t know what you’re talking
about. Girls like me--
GABE
--what? Have to pick a side? I’m
sick of your tragic Mulatto
bullshit Sam!
SAM
You can’t say Mulatto.
GABE
Mulatto! Mulatto! Mulatto!
MORE BANGING
SAM
Window. Go out the window.
GABE
I’m sorry if I can’t be your Nubian
prince on my Black horse ready to
take you back to fucking Zamunda!
68.
SAM
That’s not a real African country.
GABE
Can I please get some credit for a
solid “Coming to America”
reference?
Sam tries not laugh at this.
GABE (CONT’D)
This isn’t you Sam.
SAM
No? And who am I?
GABE
You’re this...girl...
SAM
Perceptive.
GABE
Who...likes to argue with me about
every fucking thing. And I hate it
because we both know you’re smarter
than me. Your favorite director is
Bergman, but you tell people its
Spike Lee. You love bebop, but
you’ve got a thing for Taylor
Swift. I know because my Mac picks
up your Mac’s library.
SAM
And I was so careful...
GABE
You like to use phrases from the
thirties and wear clothes from the
fifties and hairstyles from the
sixties. You like to watch me when
you think I’m sleeping. And trace
the outlines of my face.
Sam fights any signs of this moving her. Another BANG.
GABE (CONT’D)
You’re more “Banksy” than “Barack”
but you’ve been co-opted as some
sort of revolutionary leader or
something? But really you’re an
anarchist. A beautiful writer,
artist, filmmaker, shit starter.
And beautiful, in general.
69.
Sam’s heart beats through her chest. Her phone rings: “Mom.”
SAM
Yeah? Yeah? Yeah. It’s okay. Get
some sleep.
Sam hangs up. A silence hangs - followed by a loud EXHALE
from Sam as she let’s go of the tension she’d been holding.
GABE
Everything okay?
SAM
(happy tears)
His condition’s stable.
GABE
Good. That’s good Sam.
Gabe goes to exit just as Reggie BANGS again.
SAM
Gabe!
Gabe opens the door to the very shocked Bofros and Reggie...
GABE
What!?
...and brushes right past them. Sam gets up and stares down
the heartbroken looks on her disciples’ faces.
SAM
I’m sorry.
And with that she closes the door right on Reggie.
62 EXT. ELLINGTON TERRACE - NIGHT 62
Coco and Helmut look out over the campus from the glowing
terrace atop the Library. They sip on coffee’s.
HELMUT
New videos are picking up steam.
COCO
Told you I was good TV.
HELMUT
The show I’m scouting for... It’s
called Black Face / White Place.
It’s reality. Like a “True Life.”
Each episode centers on a different
one of “us” in a sea of “them.”
70.
COCO
Interesting.
HELMUT
Interesting? You think they want
interesting? Dignified stories of
triumph and survival?
(off Coco’s naive shrug)
They want the “authentic urban
experience” which is basically
network talk for bitching and weave
snatching. I’m telling you this
because the network is looking to
take one of the subjects to series.
I got one episode. One shot to find
that subject. So if we do this...
COCO
...we do it all the way. I’m
guessing Sam turned you down.
HELMUT
I think so. She called me a
Bojangling Oofta, whatever that
means. Everything else she said
would’ve been bleeped on tv.
(off Coco’s laugh)
So look, forty thousand hits on
Youtube is good. It’s not great.
COCO
I’m about to get a whole lot more.
63 INT. KURT’S HOUSE - DAY 63
Coco sits before a video camera. The room is dim.
KURT
We don’t have anyone like you on
staff and you had a great idea. We
brought you here to --
COCO
-- I want to MC it. Your party.
KURT
We’re here to tell you what we
want.
COCO
You want me and in order to get me,
you have to let me MC.
71.
(MORE)
And I want to do a live video blog
from my Youtube account.
BACK TO:
64 EXT. ELLINGTON TERRACE - DAY 64
HELMUT
They’d let you do that?
COCO
They got no choice. They need me --
BACK TO:
65 INT. KURT’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 65
COCO
-- cause without me ya’ll look like
a bunch of privileged assholes.
KURT
We don’t let people video blog our
events...
COCO
...You got a week to put this thing
together boo boo. What’s it going
to be?
CUT TO:
66 EXT. ELLINGTON TERRACE - DAY 66
Helmut looks at Coco with a shocked gleam in his eye.
COCO
You look surprised.
HELMUT
It’s just...
67 INT. TROY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT 67
Troy and Lionel both type furiously at their computers in
their rooms. Troy on his invite - Lionel on his article. They
each look at the other in alternate intervals.
HELMUT (V.O.)
...not everyone is as camera ready
as you.
67A LIONEL'S ROOM 67A
72.
COCO (CONT'D)
Lionel pauses the episode of STAR TREK THE NEXT GENERATION on
his TV and heads to...
67B KITCHEN 67B
...bar divide. Pours a bowl of cereal. He glances into Troy’s
room. He’s also got Star Trek on. Could it be? Troy, feels
Lionel’s eyes on him and quickly switches it to Basketball.
67C TROY’S ROOM 67C
Troy types in “KURT FLETCHER” in the “To” field and “PASTICHE
SUBMISSION” in the subject field. He hits “send” and swallows
the lump in his throat.
68 INT. DEANS OFFICE - DAY 68
Troy gingerly enters into the Dean’s office. Martin and Dean
Fairbanks talk in hushed tones around Fairbanks' desk.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
Martin, would you share with Troy
what you shared with me?
MARTIN
The server that processes the
voting results for House Elections
has shut down the A.P. database.
Saw it this morning. Apparently the
intermediary program is on a
refractile loop.
TROY
I’m a Poly Sci major man.
MARTIN
Sam currently has 445 votes. That’s
200 more than she had last week
during the actual election.
TROY
There’s not even that many
residents in Armstrong / Parker.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
She cheated. Hacked the system.
69 INT. PRESIDENT’S OFFICE - DAY 69
Sam sits before a giant fireplace - twice as large as the
Dean’s. She faces President Fletcher and fights nerves.
73.
SAM
I wouldn’t even begin to know how
to do something like that.
PRESIDENT FLETCHER
Is your little war really this
important?
Sam shifts gears slightly - he wants something from her.
PRESIDENT FLETCHER (CONT’D)
I understand the pressure to stand
for something at an institution
like this but you’re barking up the
wrong tree okay?
70 INT. DEAN’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 70
MARTIN
Had to have been Reggie. Dude’s in
my programing class. Good. Just
forgot to turn his program off.
TROY
Wow.
MARTIN
You’re the rightful Head of House.
TROY
(shit)
So great.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
Martin, let me talk to Troy for a
bit. I appreciate this.
71 INT. PRESIDENT’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 71
Sam glares at Fletcher.
PRESIDENT FLETCHER
Your advisor tells me you’re
hanging on by a thread in you
major. Perhaps it’s time to
reprioritize.
SAM
You’re trying to frighten me, but I
think you’re the one who’s scared.
74.
PRESIDENT FLETCHER
And I think you long for the days
where Blacks were hanging from
trees and denied actual rights.
Then you’d actually have something
to fight against.
A swell of emotion behind Sam’s steel eyes.
PRESIDENT FLETCHER (CONT’D)
You will be facing two hearings in
the coming weeks that could end in
either Probation or Suspension. One
on the merits of your show, the
other on your election to Head of
House.
Sam is truly scared by this.
PRESIDENT FLETCHER (CONT’D)
Your responsibilities to your house
are suspended. Your show is done
for. And another one of your
illegal “demonstrations” will only
make matters worse. This is a
critical time for this school.
SAM
You damn right it is.
PRESIDENT FLETCHER
We don’t have an intolerance
problem here. Except for the one
I’m looking at.
72 INT. DEAN’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 72
Troy and his father are alone.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
You didn’t tell me you and Sofia
had a misunderstanding.
TROY
Who did?
DEAN FAIRBANKS
Her father. She was very upset.
(off Troy’s silence)
Troy. What sort of vision do you
have for yourself?
75.
TROY
Get my degree. Then Law School and
then --
DEAN FAIRBANKS
--And what’s that got to do with
partying with Kurt? With smoking
weed and writing jokes?
Panic flashes over Troy.
DEAN FAIRBANKS (CONT’D)
Okay, so what? Is it the spotlight
Kurt gets? You want to be on...tv
or something? You know how many
Black men waste their lives to get
on TV? Be rappers and ball players?
TROY
(wanting it to be true)
Dad no. I want what we always
talked about. Maybe have my own
firm someday? Run for office. Make
a difference. Wife. Kids. I want
all that. I really really do.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
And the drugs? God damn it Troy I
taught you better than this. I have
been in academia a long time, I’ve
seen a lot of things. The men who
really run this world? You got no
idea what they see when they see
you. You are not going to be what
they all think you are. You will
not give them that satisfaction,
you hear me?
TROY
Yes sir.
73 INT. PRESIDENT’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 73
Sam steps out of Fletcher’s office into the waiting room.
Kurt is there. He stands and the two silently stare the other
down as Kurt enters his father’s office.
A SECRETARY picks up a ringing phone - prompts her to exit
the room. Sam watches her sign for a delivery outside through
the window.
Sam slips behind the office door - quietly pushes it open and
listens in.
76.
PRESIDENT FLETCHER
I know about the party. You picked
a hell of a time.
KURT
What party --
PRESIDENT FLETCHER
-- You’re cancelling Kurt. End of
story.
75 INT. BULLPEN - DAY 75
Lionel walks through the empty office - slows down as he over
hears...
GEORGE (O.S.)
Lionel’s story on the would-be
protest outside of Gillespie is
running tomorrow and I’m also
having Lionel work on a profile
piece of Armstrong/Parker like you
suggested. Really break down what’s
going on.
Lionel gingerly approaches the door to see George finish up a
phone call.
GEORGE (CONT’D)
Right. It’s almost like they
recycle so much from their past -
Music, food, fashion, and now
turbulence.
This leaves a bitter taste in Lionel’s mouth.
GEORGE (CONT’D)
Thank you so much. Okay, take care.
George can’t fight his grin as he looks to Annie.
ANNIE
Well?
GEORGE
That was our Times advisor. He said
it’s stories like these that get
editors recommendation letters.
Lionel knocks on the door. Annie and George are startled but
reassured when they see who it is.
77.
LIONEL
The Negro at the door didn’t scare
you this time.
Annie smiles and heads for the door.
ANNIE
Lionel please. You’re only
technically Black. G, going to
French. You want me to hold your
seat?
GEORGE
Thanks.
Annie smiles and walks out.
LIONEL
You need something? Saw your email.
GEORGE
Yeah, I need someone to do the
Donor’s function on Saturday. Small
dinner for the school’s big givers.
Administration wants a little
coverage.
LIONEL
That’s Halloween night.
GEORGE
Right, which is why no one else
will take it.
LIONEL
Ah. Thus the new guy.
George gathers his backpack and walks over to Lionel. Gets
close.
GEORGE
On my way to class, but you can
stay and check out last year’s
piece. You’ll do fine.
LIONEL
I don’t know. Are there going to be
any racially fueled outbursts at
this thing?
GEORGE
Never know right?
78.
It’s clear Lionel wants to say something else. George too.
LIONEL
Am I a good writer?
GEORGE
You’ll get better. And we need you
right now.
LIONEL
You’re just a big recommendation
away from landing the Times.
GEORGE
God I hope so.
Lionel looks down. He is being used. Turns to go, just as --
GEORGE (CONT’D)
Hey.
-- George grabs Lionel unsure what he wants to say. So
instead he just kisses him.
GEORGE (CONT’D)
I’m glad we finally got that Bugle
on your chest.
Lionel’s all mixed up.
GEORGE (CONT’D)
There’s a big party the night of
the Donor’s event. Call me after,
maybe we can hang?
LIONEL
Yeah. Sounds good.
George heads out - leaving Lionel perplexed.
76 INT. TROY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT 76
Troy stares at his reflection in a mirror as he lifts his durag
to reveal his perfectly curled finger waves. He’s getting
ready for something.
His phone buzzes with a notification: “Message from:
PASTICHE”
Troy nervously clicks it open. As he reads...
79.
KURT (V.O.)
Dear White People. Are you tired of
your hum drum, Wonderbread
existence of accidental racism and
wishing you could sip on Henny out
yo crunk cup without a Bitch giving
you the side-eye? Course you are.
MONTAGE:
As our subjects get ready for their evening.
Troy goes back to combing over his finger waves, finding and
correcting imperceptible imperfections.
KURT (V.O.)
For all those looking to unleash
their inner Negro from years of
bondage and oppression Pastiche
proudly presents “Dear White
People” our 89th annual Hallow’s
Eve Costume Party - tonight at 10
Pacific Time or 5 Colored People
Time. Sorry for the short notice,
but let’s keep it one hun-ed.
You’ve had us on your calendar for
weeks.
76A Lionel stares into a mirror in an ill fitting suit 76A
combing out his unwieldy fro. He flinches in pain as he
fluffs out each section.
KURT (V.O.)
Dudes must rock FUBU, Ecko,
Rocawear, or Sean John. XXXL is the
smallest size T-Shirt you can wear,
preferably with a collage of Barack
Obama and Tupac on it. Stunner
Shades, chains, and Blue-Tooth
devices sticking out yo ears are
also encouraged.
76B Coco pulls a blonde curly wig over her natural hair. She 76B
smooths her tendrils to frame her face, almost pale with
foundation. She begins on her eyes.
KURT (V.O.)
Ladies, we need to see huge hoop
earrings, long nails, and cheap
tight clothes.
80.
(MORE)
A proper hood rat starts fights,
speaks loudly, and when she can’t
think of the word she’s trying to
say just makes one up, such as
“edumicated.” Feel free to fry up
some chicken, bring Kool-Aid,
Watermelon, 40s, Henny, and of
course Dat Purple Drank. No bougie
bitches allowed.
76C Sam removes the pins and the black power Afro pic holding 76C
up her pompadour fro hair-do, and lets it fall flat around
her ears. She takes in her image in the mirror.
KURT (V.O.)
Naturally there will be a freestyle
rap competition so bring it, get yo
shine on and join us for the party
of the year! Oh and Nigga Nigga
Nigga Nigga. Boy that felt good.
77 EXT. GILLESPIE HALL - NIGHT 77
Laughter and music from the well to do event wafts outside
while Troy dressed in a slick Armani tux hangs by the
entrance. He smokes on Coco’s one-hitter from before.
Lionel steps out in his ill fitted suit, a camera in hand.
The two are surprised to see each other.
LIONEL
Funny seeing you here.
TROY
Father likes to show me off at all
the Donor functions. The dessert
course is usually my cue to take a
breather while they talk shop.
(friendlier)
The trick is to dazzle them into
forking over their estates just
before they kick the bucket.
Lionel could just leave. Instead he accepts the olive branch.
LIONEL
So...Picard or Kirk?
TROY
Kirk. Wait...
LIONEL
I saw you watching Star --
81.
KURT (V.O.) (CONT'D)
TROY
-- Yo what happens in the crib
stays in the crib. Not trying to
get my card revoked.
LIONEL
Hey, some could argue that a show
with Whoopi Goldberg, Michael Dorn
and Kunta Kinte himself is a pretty
Black show.
TROY
Yeah? That work out for you?
LIONEL
No. No it did not. At least not in
High School. I bet there’s a statue
of you at your High School.
TROY
I was beloved. Won’t lie.
LIONEL
Did they know you were a trekker?
TROY
My pops left a paint by numbers
template for success at that High
School. All I had to do was fill in
the blanks. Football captain.
Valedictorian. Prom King.
Lionel sees a sadness in Troy.
TROY (CONT’D)
So what? You’re growing that out?
LIONEL
I think it’s gaining sentience.
TROY
It’s...out there.
LIONEL
It’s like a black hole for white
people’s fingers. They’re obsessed.
TROY
You know I cut hair. Why didn’t you
ask me?
LIONEL
You’re I dunno...you?
82.
Behind Lionel, George and Annie pass by the steps to
Gillespie.
GEORGE
Li! You ready man?
LIONEL
No costumes? I got a tux for this.
ANNIE
We just got out of the staff room.
GEORGE
Yeah, we’re going as overworked.
LIONEL
Where is it?
ANNIE
Garmin House. On third I think?
LIONEL
Third and Basin. I know it.
Before Lionel jets to join them.
TROY
Yo man. If I’d gone to your High
School, I’d have had your back.
Lionel smiles and heads after his new friends.
78 EXT. KURT’S HOUSE - NIGHT 78
Lionel pauses before his old home - now filled with the chaos
of a wild party. Lionel clears his throat and heads in.
79 INT. KURT’S HOUSE - NIGHT 79
The party is dark and rambunctious. Lots of white kids in
costume. Some as fairies or ninjas or Spiderman - but most as
pimps and thugs. As Blaxploitation characters. As Barack
Obama and Condi Rice. As Shaft, Ice Cube, and 2 Chainz.
It’s a lot for Lionel. Cups are handed to them filled with
“Purple Drank.” Everyone downs the stuff.
INT. GILLESPIE HALL - NIGHT
Troy is being appreciated by an ancient COUPLE.
TROY
...my own firm. Maybe run for
office. Make a difference you know?
83.
The couple smile. A buzz draws Troy’s eyes to his phone -
photos from “Dear White People” pop up in his news feed.
80 INT. KURT’S HOUSE - NIGHT 80
Lionel watches as Gordon and other Pastiche crew nervously
put up flyers and posters. They seem caught off guard. Lionel
glances at the posters - it’s Kurt with a large Afro wig
mimicking Sam’s “Missing Black Culture” flyers.
LIONEL
This is kind of fucked up. Right?
GEORGE
Pastiche. The world’s most erudite
boneheads. Who wants another round?
Come on Lionel, help a brother out.
LIONEL
Kitchen’s this way.
80A ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS 80A
Coco enters the party - blinged out like Nicki Minaj. She’s
feeling herself as she’s handed a drink.
She’s got eyes on her - for the first time like this at a
party. But she sees the same thing Lionel saw.
Her confidence starts to fight a shame that creeps up beneath
her party face. She switches her iPhone to video mode...
COCO
Hey there muffins. How do I look?
Why are white folks so obsessed
with being Black? And why are Black
folks so addicted to Blonde Barbie
doll weaves? Honeys it’s a strange
symbiosis we’re here to explore...
Coco’s voice cracks as she stares into her own image on her
iPhone. She pauses it and takes a breath.
80B HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 80B
Lionel leads George through the dense crowd towards the
kitchen - George pulls Lionel into a hallway and into...
80C BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS 80C
...the bathroom and up against the door. George inhales
Lionel’s lips. Runs his fingers through Lionel’s hair.
84.
LIONEL
Ouch.
GEORGE
Sorry.
LIONEL
It’s okay. Can’t wait to cut all
this off.
GEORGE
Don’t you dare.
George plunges his fingers into Lionel’s fro once again.
Pulls a touch too hard.
GEORGE (CONT’D)
I could eat you like a Hershey’s.
This sets something off in Lionel.
LIONEL
I’ll be right back.
Lionel breaks George’s grasp and heads out the bathroom...
LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
...and back out into the party. He’s trapped in a nightmare
of caricatures and reveling students. Can’t breathe.
EXT. KURT’S HOUSE - NIGHT
Lionel squeezes his way outside. Something goes off in his
head as he starts walking away from the party.
Just then Kurt arrives in front of the house with some
friends. Looks at Lionel then at the house.
KURT
What the hell?
81 INT. ARMSTRONG / PARKER - NIGHT 81
Lionel paces the halls. His mind churns as he passes the
dining hall. Sam and Reggie are engaged in something intense.
DINING HALL
SAM
For a genius dude you’re a fucking
idiot.
85.
REGGIE
I did it, we did it for you.
SAM
I didn’t ask for it Reggie. I look
like I betrayed this house.
REGGIE
Yeah? Well you betrayed me.
Sam gets up and storms out - brushes past Lionel.
LIONEL
Sam? Can we talk?
Sam turns back around fiercely.
82 INT. KURT’S HOUSE - NIGHT 82
A turntable is uncovered and rolled out - as a DUDE DRESSED
LIKE SERENA WILLIAMS starts up a MYSTIKAL record.
The crowd starts to get live now.
Coco continues to make her way through the party - her face
visibly perturbed by the time she reaches the kitchen. She
continues out back...
83 EXT. KURT’S BACKYARD - NIGHT 83
...and sits pulling out a cigarette. She sees Annie put on a
long straight Black wig and brag to friends...
ANNIE
Hey who am I? “Bitch it’s weave.
Noun. Present tense ho!”
Right in the gut. She’s playing Coco. Coco grabs her phone...
84 INT. KURT’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 84
Kurt stumbles about the party in a daze. Drunk? Folks give
him props while he searches for and spots Gordon with the
others. His phone rings.
KURT
Yeah?
INTERCUT
COCO
Kurt, it’s me. I can’t do this.
86.
KURT
Okay, I’m fucking confused.
85 INT. SAM’S ROOM - NIGHT 85
Lionel sits across from Sam.
SAM
What do you want me to do? Go over
there and yell at them?
LIONEL
Have you heard you yelling?
SAM
This house is filled with folks
willing to take up after a cause
Lionel. Believe me. Never would
have guessed you’d be one of them
but...
LIONEL
For the first time in my life, I
can’t just sit around and do
nothing. How can you?
SAM
If I’m caught being a part of
anything like this...it wouldn’t be
good for me right now okay?
Lionel gets up and walks towards the door.
SAM (CONT’D)
I’m done being everybody’s angry
Black chick.
Sam looks down as Lionel gets up and heads out.
Sam’s focus shifts to her Super 8 resting by the door and
then to a bullhorn directly across from it. Her mind ticks.
86 INT. ARMSTRONG / PARKER HALL - NIGHT 86
Lionel exits and paces down the hall. He walks by the dining
room - taken over by Reggie, the BoFros, and a mix of other
students mostly from ARMSTRONG / PARKER.
86A DINING HALL - CONTINUOUS 86A
Lionel gingerly walks in the room. He’s still an outsider
here - but something’s changed in him.
87.
LIONEL
Hey. How’s it going. Hi.
No one answers him - just stay to their own conversations.
Lionel spots a familiar face...Sungmi.
LIONEL (CONT’D)
Hey...what is this?
SUNGMI
Black Student Union.
Lionel smiles shyly. He should’ve known that.
Reggie, Curls, Dreads and the Bofros hang out at the front.
DREADS
Your call then man.
REGGIE
(to everyone)
Alright ya’ll - thanks for coming
out tonight. Looks like Sam’s not
making it so...let’s just call it.
The crowd starts to talk amongst themselves, get up and
leave. Just then Lionel stands and before he can think...
LIONEL
Uh. Excuse me. Hi. I’m Lionel. Some
of you...none of you probably know
me. I’ve never been to a meeting.
But I just came back from a party
on campus and I think you should
know about it.
Lionel’s nerves can be heard in his voice now. He’s got the
judging eyes of the room fixed silently on him. He sees an
open laptop on a desk.
LIONEL (CONT’D)
Anybody mind if I?
Reggie shifts a bit as Lionel goes to the laptop and pulls up
the party on Facebook. The crowd gathers around as Lionel
browses through the photos.
LIONEL (CONT’D)
I mean...I don’t know. This is
fucked up right?
REGGIE
Alright brother. What’s the plan?
88.
Lionel realizes the eyes aren’t judging. They’re mobilizing.
Readying for action. Lionel steels himself.
LIONEL
We go over there. Now.
CURLS
Think there’s enough of us?
SUNGMI
You know you don’t have a monopoly
on being a pissed off minority.
Latino’s United is meeting across
the hall. Asian American League
too.
(off the stares)
You guys got better snacks.
87 INT. GILLESPIE HALL - NIGHT 87
Troy scrolls through an endless amount of Facebook uploads
from the party. Forties, bad Afro wigs, fake asses.
Shoved in between two RICH OLD WELL TO DOS at a long table
covered in empty plates and glasses - Troy looks across to
his father, in mid exaggerated guffaw with President
Fletcher.
TROY
Dad...
DEAN FAIRBANKS
Not now Troy.
TROY
It’s important. There’s something
happening on campus. I might’ve...
DEAN FAIRBANKS
You’re being rude son.
Dean Fairbanks turns away. Troy ponders a moment and then--
TROY
Oh am I? How about I tell your
precious donors and anyone here
who’ll listen about the kind of a
school it is they’re giving to?
The Dean can feel the eyes of the Donors and the President on
him - an outrage comes over him as he pulls Troy aside.
89.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
I don’t know who you think you are
young man but you don’t get to talk
to your father any kind of way.
TROY
All I say to you is yes sir and no
sir! Look I should’ve brought this
up before but --
(off Fairbanks dismissal)
-- listen to me!
Dean Fairbanks tries to cover this moment with a smile.
88 INT. KURT’S KITCHEN - NIGHT 88
Kurt, still dazed, huddles with his core Pastiche group.
KURT
What?
GORDON
Yeah dude. We all got it. I mean,
everything’s cool right?
A noise in the other room startles them...
88A LIVING ROOM 88A
...It’s Reggie who knocks over a bowl of chips. Dreads argues
with a few people. Martin rips shades off a kid’s face. The
party swarms with BSU kids and their Latino / Asian allies.
A SMASH yanks Kurt’s attention back to the kitchen...
88B KITCHEN 88B
...where Lionel smashes bottles of liquor in the sink.
KURT
Lionel?
Kurt yanks the booze from Lionel and shoves him.
KURT (CONT’D)
The fuck you think you’re doing
man?
Lionel shoves Kurt into the bar divide. A few of the BSU kids
flood into the kitchen and hold Kurt back.
KURT (CONT’D)
That all you got?
90.
LIONEL
We’re putting an end to this Kurt.
KURT
Fuck you I’m calling the cops.
MARTIN
Half of this crowd is under 21.
A loud AMP sound alerts everyone to the DJ platform in the
Living Room.
88C LIVING ROOM 88C
Mitch has taken over the mic.
MITCH
Gimme that mic
Before I slap ya
Looking for some dykes,
that wanna another chapta.
If you do me slow,
you can do me faster,
I’ll pass you to the Nigga on my
right, he gets you after.
LIONEL
Kurt--
KURT
-- Why don’t you tuck your tail
between your legs, run and tell the
Dean and get the fuck out.
Lionel sinks from this attack while his posse from BSU
watches helplessly as the party goes back into full swing.
Lionel turns to go and spots...
...George who joins Annie, fresh beer in hand. But right
behind George is...
...Sam, having just arrived with her camera in hand pointed
at the rap battle. She winks at Lionel.
Lionel turns around - summons something from deep inside.
Lionel steps onto the DJ platform and snatches the mic out of
one of the rapper’s hands.
LIONEL
Heyyyy! Hoooo! Heyyy! Hooo!
91.
The crowd is with it - thinks it’s part of the show as Lionel
proceeds to freestyle terribly...
LIONEL (CONT’D)
My name is Lionel,
Some people call me Li.
Lots of people think
that I talk kinda white.
Well that’s alright.
Yeah that’s cool.
I’d rather you think I’m white,
than tap dance for you.
With that Lionel takes the mic and SMASHES it on the wall. He
then takes the turntable by his hands and flips it over.
Sparks fly - the amp goes crazy - the crowd is in shock.
Lionel grabs a speaker tower and slams it to the ground.
Lionel’s off the platform now. Kurt grabs him - Reggie pushes
Kurt away in his defense.
Gordon grabs Reggie - A FIGHT BREAKS OUT.
More equipment is slammed to the ground and stomped on as the
party disintegrates into chaos.
Sam dodges fights to capture it all with the camera.
Art is being ripped from the walls. Dishes being smashed on
the ground. Arguments come to physical blows.
The steel in Sam’s gaze fades. Replaced by...heartbreak?
And then she spots...
...Coco squeezing her way through the crowd for the door.
Sam’s camera and mic stay trained on Coco.
COCO
What? Say it. Come on.
Sam stays silent.
COCO (CONT’D)
This may come as a shock, but these
people don’t give a fuck about no
Harriet muthafuckin Tubman. They
pay millions of dollars on their
tans, their lips, their asses, Jay-
Z tickets, you name it, cause they
wanna be us.
92.
(MORE)
So they got to be for a night.I’m
not about to go out into the
streets in protest of a Halloween
party.
Sam keeps her mouth shut and her camera rolling as Coco
realizes it’s herself she’s trying to convince.
Coco storms off. Sam exhales and lowers her camera. This is
new for her. Keeping her mouth shut.
89 EXT. KURT’S HOUSE - NIGHT 89
Coco trudges down the side walk - yanks off her hair, her
lashes, her bling - shedding the shame of the night.
90 EXT. KURT’S YARD - NIGHT 90
Kurt hustles Lionel out into the yard. Kurt shoves him to the
ground.
KURT
Dude. I know you can’t help it...
Lionel just gets back up again only to be slammed down.
KURT (CONT’D)
...but why are you such a fag dude?
Lionel spits in Kurt’s face and pops right back up again. We
see it in his eyes - he’ll never give up.
Kurt’s hand is on Lionel’s collar. He pushes him down again.
Kids are all around - some from the BSU - some from Pastiche -
some from the Bugle. Everyone holds an opposite party back.
Lionel looks over at his audience and then into Kurt’s eyes.
Lionel leans in and kisses Kurt on the mouth long and hard.
LIONEL
Finally got me where you want me.
Kurt’s in shock. He looks at his crew who laugh at him.
Lionel sees the surprise in the eyes of his new supporters as
well. No time to soak this in though. Kurt’s let up. For a
moment. Lionel turns back to Kurt and PUNCHES him in the
face. The BSU kids go CRAZY in support.
The shock gone - Kurt damn near knocks Lionel out.
The world goes all slow motion and out of focus. Lionel sort
of makes out that Kurt is yanked off him.
93.
COCO (CONT’D)
Kids run in different directions - Flashlights fill the yard -
One is shone directly on Lionel. CAMPUS SAFETY GUARDS and a
couple POLICE OFFICERS surround him.
91 INT. KURT’S HOUSE - NIGHT 91
The motor on Sam’s Super 8 ticks away. The party is at a
complete standstill.
Troy enters and looks around in disbelief. Makes eye contact
with Kurt who is being held by a Campus Safety Officer.
Dean Fairbanks enters and stands in the middle of the chaos.
Sam tip toes in for a close up and holds out a small mic.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
What is all this?
92 INT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT 92
A SERIES OF SHOTS FROM A MOVIE BEING PROJECTED ON A SCREEN
We see the Dean looking about the party with disappointment.
CUT TO:
92A KURT looking bewildered outside his house after the 92A
party. We hear BOOS from a crowd. The carnage is devastating.
Windows are blown out - trash and destroyed furniture on the
lawn. Ash where fires were put out.
KURT
I didn’t do this. Sam. I had
nothing to do with this.

I’m sorry but it’s bullshit. Yo
this is how we get down. If you

This is an attack on free speech!
We’re the victims here!
CUT TO:
93A A series of Busts have been PAINTED IN BLACK FACE outside 93A

LIONEL
It’s hard enough for us to even get

a debate because of who Kurt’s dad

93C A POSTER featuring Troy rendered like the famous Shepard 93C
Fairy Obama posters with the words “A NEW HOPE” written at
the bottom as well as “TROY BROUSSARD FOR PRESIDENT.” This
gets some more applause from the crowd watching.
TROY
Of course I got my dad involved. It
was the right thing to do. I didn’t
mean for all this to happen. All
the posters and everything.
SAM (O.S.)
But you’d welcome it? A shot for

the moment. To savor in the pop of

SAM
Dear White People...
SAM (V.O.)
I wanted to react.
Sam takes in a thoughtful breath before...
SAM
...Know what? Nevermind.
She fades in a melancholy piece of Be-Bop before hanging her
headpones up as the title on the projected movie fades in:
“...BLACK FACES BY SAMANTHA WHITE”
Sam stares nervously at the screen as the lights come on,
when all at once the room BREAKS INTO APPLAUSE. Sam turns to
see that the entire room is on it’s feet including Prof
Bodkin and Gabe.

So when I got the invite and saw
everyone clicking “yes” I figured
it was back on.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
You were hoping to make the staff?

DEAN FAIRBANKS
At what point in time did you show
up to the event?
94C Sam sits with arms folded. 94C
DEAN FAIRBANKS (CONT’D)
Samantha. Please.
SAM
Why am I even here?
CUT TO:
KURT
94 Guys throw parties at the house all 94
the time.
97.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
We know you were planning this.
KURT
Your son tell you that?
CUT TO:
94D Fairbanks stares down his son. Troy is silent and anxious.9 4D
DEAN FAIRBANKS
(reading)
“...wishing you could sip on Henny
out yo crunk cup without a Bitch
giving you the side-eye?”
(and then)
You write this Troy?
Troy looks up at his father embarrassed.
TROY
No. Mine wasn’t chosen.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
But you wanted to be?
TROY
What I wanted didn’t matter then.
Why should it matter now? I told
you about the party, remember?
CUT TO:
DEAN FAIRBANKS
94 The invite came from the Pastiche 94
Facebook account.
KURT
I loathe Facebook.
An OFFICIAL whispers something in Fairbanks' ear.
KURT (CONT’D)
You’ve got to believe me.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
You’ve used that line on me before
this year Mr. Fletcher. When a
homophobic message mysteriously
appeared on a voice mail line you
shared with a roommate.
CUT TO:
98.
DEAN FAIRBANKS (CONT’D)
What were your intentions when you
went back the second time?
LIONEL
To stop it.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
By any means necessary?
LIONEL
Someone once told me...Manchester
is like jazz. I don’t know much
about jazz. But from what I can
tell, when your solo’s up, you
better blow.
Fairbanks fights a smile.
CUT TO:
94C SAM 94C
All I did that night was hit record
brother.
The Dean takes a gulp from a glass of water. He stands and
looks out his huge windows onto the campus below.
CUT TO:
94E The Dean has Facebook opened on his computer. Officials 94E
are taking a break. Drinking water. Discussing the day.
The Dean tries a few passwords.
CUT TO:
94C DEAN FAIRBANKS 94C
Want to hear something strange?
The Dean turns from the window.
DEAN FAIRBANKS (CONT’D)
The Pastiche group page hadn’t been
used for months, until the invite
went out.
CUT TO:
94E The Dean tries a different password. Still invalid. 94E
CUT TO:
99.
94C SAM 94C
Fascinating.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
Well what’s interesting is how easy
it was to access the group before
the note was sent. The password was
“Pa$tiche” spelled with a dollar
sign according to Kurt. Seems
recently it’s been changed.
CUT TO:
94E The Dean tries one more. It works. 94E
CUT TO:
94C DEAN FAIRBANKS (CONT’D) 94C
Couldn’t figure it out at first.
Then I thought to try something.
Five, seven, eight, three, five,
twenty six, one, nine, four, six.
Eleven numbers. Just like our
student ID numbers. Just like your
student ID number.
SAM
As much as you hate him, you will
stop at nothing to protect your
master and his boy.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
Did you send out the invite Sam?
SAM
That invite, whoever sent it
should’ve been met with derision
and outrage. Instead, a hundred
people showed up and they pulled
out posters and decorations and
costumes they’d made for just such
an occasion.
Sam and Dean Fairbanks at a stalemate.
Silence falls in the room. The Dean’s mind ticks.
95 EXT. MANCHESTER UNIVERSITY - DAY 95
A pack of EMERALD BUGLE newspapers hit the stand with the
headline: “INVESTIGATION INCONCLUSIVE! FLETCHER GOES FREE. NO
EXPULSIONS MADE”
100.
Next to it is another stack of papers from the INDEPENDENT
OBSERVER. The headline reads: “EBONY & IVY: CAN THERE BE
HARMONY? BY LIONEL HIGGINS.”
George picks up a copy of the Observer and starts to read...
96 INT. TROY AND LIONEL’S APARTMENT - DAY 96
Lionel flips through his own article as well. A satisfied
grin on his face as a razor makes its way through his hair.
LIONEL
2 Chainz? Shaft? While endless
complex depictions of whites, white
men in particular exist - there
aren’t that many versions of us in
the culture.
His locks waft towards the ground as Troy styles a fresh and
fearless fro-hawk atop Lionel’s head.
LIONEL (CONT’D)
Culture has a powerful way of
telling people what they can and
can’t be. For people of color the
options are rather limited.
TROY
Next James Baldwin up in here. Wait
hold on a sec.
Star Trek is back from commercial break. Troy and Lionel
watch in silence.
97 EXT. MANCHESTER UNIVERSITY - DAY 97
Gabe is just about finished with Lionel’s article too. Looks
up just in time to see...
GABE
Hello Sam.
Sam sneers at his formalities.
GABE (CONT’D)
Read about Armstrong / Parker.
SAM
Yeah. Prez made an executive
withdrawal. Armstrong stays Black.
GABE
Congrats?
101.
SAM
(with a shrug)
Getting too dramatic man. Thinking
about getting an apartment off
campus. We’ll see.
GABE
Sam going against the grain?
Shocked. How’s papa White?
SAM
He’s recovering.
GABE
Good. Well...
Gabe fights the urge to hug her.
SAM
We were actually on the phone last
night for hours. First time we
talked since the bypass. He was
putting up a strong front. Teasing
me about being so worried. Then
came the stories about me as a
little girl I’d heard a thousand
times. About how independent I was.
Gabe smiles politely. Senses she needs a moment.
GABE
Want to talk about it?
SAM
My mother worked nights so he would
take me to school. And it pissed me
off because he would follow me all
the way to homeroom. Every time he
tried to hold my hand I’d scream
and pull away. He thought I was
just being...difficult.
A hint of recognition in Gabe. Is this about them?
SAM (CONT’D)
But it was the kids. And the
parents and the teachers. They’d
see this Black girl and this white
man and wonder what we were doing
together. Even at nine I could feel
their eyes on me. Especially at
nine. It brought tears to my eyes.
Gabe’s stone face melts at this.
102.
SAM (CONT’D)
I was just a bratty girl, didn’t
know any better but-- The thought
of losing him-- You know? I just
feel so bad. How awful am I to do
that to him? To anyone I love?
Gabe gets it. This is an explanation. An apology, to him. His
arm is on her shoulder now.
GABE
I’m sure he forgives you.
SAM
Think so?
Gabe nods. Sam’s normal defenses come back up lest she cries.
SAM (CONT’D)
So anyway. I didn’t mean to say all
of that. I don’t know why I did.
GABE
Sam. Where are you going?
SAM
I don’t know. Lunch?
Gabe starts to walk with her.
GABE
Isn’t it Mac and Cheese day at
Armstrong/Parker?
SAM
Think they’ll let you in?
Gabe smiles. They walk a bit. Then he grabs her hand. Sam
lets the moment happen. Squeezes his back. They look into
each others’ eyes.
Don’t even notice as Reggie and the Bofros pass them by.
98 INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 98
Coco sits across from Helmut. He’s got his eyes on a Youtube
clip from Sam’s movie featuring Coco.
COCO (YOUTUBE)
I know this may come as a shock,
but they don’t give a fuck about no
Harriet muthafuckin Tubman...
103.
HELMUT
Two hundred thousand views. Look
they even auto-tuned it.
With a click Helmut pulls it up.
AUTOTUNED COCO (YOUTUBE)
Muthafuckin Tubman! Muthatfuckin
Tubman! Don’t give a fuck about no
muthafuckin Tubman!
Coco’s not sure what to think.
HELMUT
Couple months, that’s how long
shooting for an episode takes. We
recommend you cut your course load
in half to accommodate the
schedule.
COCO
Half?
HELMUT
Trust me it it’ll read “full-time”
in the episode. If...once we go to
series, we might have to figure out
a summer schedule.
COCO
For shooting?
HELMUT
For uh...classes and stuff. Won’t
be graduating early anymore
sweetheart.
Helmut shifts a contract over to Coco.
HELMUT (CONT’D)
Five grand for the episode. Twenty
each if you get picked up for
series. What do you say?
Coco stares at the contract and back at Helmut.
HELMUT (CONT’D)
Trust me sweetie it’s the same out
there as it is in here. Good news
is? Against all that damn white you
and I? We pop. Think I wanted to be
the go-to producer for all things
Black?
104.
Coco shrugs.
HELMUT (CONT’D)
Tell you what’s worse though. Being
that broke Nigga stuck on the south
side of Chicago. Hundred and
Fiftieth street.
Coco takes a deep breath. Stares right into his eyes --
99 EXT. MANCHESTER - DAY 99
Coco exits a building and spots Troy up ahead. He’s flanked
by his former enemies turned supporters, Reggie and the other
BoFros. They all carry Troy’s “New Hope” posters.
COCO
Made some new friends?
Troy shrugs as Coco grabs for his hand. He pulls away and
shares a glance with Reggie, who doesn’t approve.
COCO (CONT’D)
Fine.
TROY
Come on Coco.
COCO
Fuck you.
Coco starts to walk ahead.
TROY
My dad saw your videos. He’s a
little worried about --
COCO
-- how it’ll look. With your
campaign and all. What’s your best
friend Reggie think?
Troy motions for Reggie to go on ahead.
TROY
We had fun, alright?
COCO
I get everyone else wants you to
win Troy. But do you?
Troy doesn’t know how to answer that. He stares at the
triumphant, winning version of himself on his poster.
105.
Coco’s eyes shift longingly as she walks ahead - unsure of
who she is at the moment and who she will be in the next.
Watching her is Lionel and Sam - sitting with Gabe and
Sungmi. They both know that look well...
SAM
Hey Lionel. With me out and Troy
moving on - A/P’s going to need a
new head of house.
LIONEL
Think there’s a story there? Who do
you think it’ll be?
Sam and Sungmi share a glance and stare right at Lionel.
LIONEL (CONT’D)
What? No.
SUNGMI
Everyone loves you. Won’t be hard
to rally the vote.
SAM
Yeah. We got you man.
Lionel takes in this moment. One of complete acceptance.
100 INT. FLETCHERS OFFICE - DAY 100
Fairbanks turns from the window in Fletcher’s office to join
him at his desk. They’re all ears as they look across to...
HELMUT
Let me get this straight. First you
tried to break up the Black house.
Then you took down the sister with
the little radio show. And after
all that, your kid throws a
Blackface party?
FLETCHER
Now wait a minute!
HELMUT
You thought you were having money
problems before? Wait till cable
gets their hands on this story.
Bill Maher is gon’ fuck you up!
FLETCHER
I have heard enough --
106.
HELMUT
-- Wait I’m sorry. Look from where
I’m sitting this place is a
goldmine.
DEAN FAIRBANKS
What?
HELMUT
For one we got to show the events
that led up to the party --
DEAN FAIRBANKS
-- That already happened.
HELMUT
Well yeah, but we can reenact --
DEAN FAIRBANKS
-- reenact?
HELMUT
Documentary term...Look, I can
start putting together an overall
deal today. I’m talking real money!
Turns out the one thing America
likes in it’s reality more than
ignant Black folks, is crazy racist
White people!
DEAN FAIRBANKS
Now you look here. This is an
honorable institution. The idea
that we would so much as entertain
this suggestion --
Fletcher holds his hand up. His turn to speak.
FLETCHER
How much we talking?
Fairbanks’ outrage turns to resignation as Helmut, the one
winner here smiles. Dollar signs in his eyes.

Black M,LUNATIC INTERLUDE,"1 ContributorThe Secret Agent (Chap. 12) LyricsWinnie Verloc, the widow of Mr Verloc, the sister of the late faithful Stevie (blown to fragments in a state of innocence and in the conviction of being engaged in a humanitarian enterprise), did not run beyond the door of the parlour.  She had indeed run away so far from a mere trickle of blood, but that was a movement of instinctive repulsion.  And there she had paused, with staring eyes and lowered head.  As though she had run through long years in her flight across the small parlour, Mrs Verloc by the door was quite a different person from the woman who had been leaning over the sofa, a little swimmy in her head, but otherwise free to enjoy the profound calm of idleness and irresponsibility.  Mrs Verloc was no longer giddy.  Her head was steady.  On the other hand, she was no longer calm.  She was afraid.

If she avoided looking in the direction of her reposing husband it was not because she was afraid of him.  Mr Verloc was not frightful to behold.  He looked comfortable.  Moreover, he was dead.  Mrs Verloc entertained no vain delusions on the subject of the dead.  Nothing brings them back, neither love nor hate.  They can do nothing to you.  They are as nothing.  Her mental state was tinged by a sort of austere contempt for that man who had let himself be killed so easily.  He had been the master of a house, the husband of a woman, and the murderer of her Stevie.  And now he was of no account in every respect.  He was of less practical account than the clothing on his body, than his overcoat, than his boots—than that hat lying on the floor.  He was nothing.  He was not worth looking at.  He was even no longer the murderer of poor Stevie.  The only murderer that would be found in the room when people came to look for Mr Verloc would be—herself!

Her hands shook so that she failed twice in the task of refastening her veil.  Mrs Verloc was no longer a person of leisure and responsibility.  She was afraid.  The stabbing of Mr Verloc had been only a blow.  It had relieved the pent-up agony of shrieks strangled in her throat, of tears dried up in her hot eyes, of the maddening and indignant rage at the atrocious part played by that man, who was less than nothing now, in robbing her of the boy.

It had been an obscurely prompted blow.  The blood trickling on the floor off the handle of the knife had turned it into an extremely plain case of murder.  Mrs Verloc, who always refrained from looking deep into things, was compelled to look into the very bottom of this thing.  She saw there no haunting face, no reproachful shade, no vision of remorse, no sort of ideal conception.  She saw there an object.  That object was the gallows.  Mrs Verloc was afraid of the gallows.

She was terrified of them ideally.  Having never set eyes on that last argument of men’s justice except in illustrative woodcuts to a certain type of tales, she first saw them erect against a black and stormy background, festooned with chains and human bones, circled about by birds that peck at dead men’s eyes.  This was frightful enough, but Mrs Verloc, though not a well-informed woman, had a sufficient knowledge of the institutions of her country to know that gallows are no longer erected romantically on the banks of dismal rivers or on wind-swept headlands, but in the yards of jails.  There within four high walls, as if into a pit, at dawn of day, the murderer was brought out to be executed, with a horrible quietness and, as the reports in the newspapers always said, “in the presence of the authorities.”  With her eyes staring on the floor, her nostrils quivering with anguish and shame, she imagined herself all alone amongst a lot of strange gentlemen in silk hats who were calmly proceeding about the business of hanging her by the neck.  That—never!  Never!  And how was it done?  The impossibility of imagining the details of such quiet execution added something maddening to her abstract terror.  The newspapers never gave any details except one, but that one with some affectation was always there at the end of a meagre report.  Mrs Verloc remembered its nature.  It came with a cruel burning pain into her head, as if the words “The drop given was fourteen feet” had been scratched on her brain with a hot needle.  “The drop given was fourteen feet.”

These words affected her physically too.  Her throat became convulsed in waves to resist strangulation; and the apprehension of the jerk was so vivid that she seized her head in both hands as if to save it from being torn off her shoulders.  “The drop given was fourteen feet.”  No! that must never be.  She could not stand that.  The thought of it even was not bearable.  She could not stand thinking of it.  Therefore Mrs Verloc formed the resolution to go at once and throw herself into the river off one of the bridges.

This time she managed to refasten her veil.  With her face as if masked, all black from head to foot except for some flowers in her hat, she looked up mechanically at the clock.  She thought it must have stopped.  She could not believe that only two minutes had passed since she had looked at it last.  Of course not.  It had been stopped all the time.  As a matter of fact, only three minutes had elapsed from the moment she had drawn the first deep, easy breath after the blow, to this moment when Mrs Verloc formed the resolution to drown herself in the Thames.  But Mrs Verloc could not believe that.  She seemed to have heard or read that clocks and watches always stopped at the moment of murder for the undoing of the murderer.  She did not care.  “To the bridge—and over I go.” . . . But her movements were slow.

She dragged herself painfully across the shop, and had to hold on to the handle of the door before she found the necessary fortitude to open it.  The street frightened her, since it led either to the gallows or to the river.  She floundered over the doorstep head forward, arms thrown out, like a person falling over the parapet of a bridge.  This entrance into the open air had a foretaste of drowning; a slimy dampness enveloped her, entered her nostrils, clung to her hair.  It was not actually raining, but each gas lamp had a rusty little halo of mist.  The van and horses were gone, and in the black street the curtained window of the carters’ eating-house made a square patch of soiled blood-red light glowing faintly very near the level of the pavement.  Mrs Verloc, dragging herself slowly towards it, thought that she was a very friendless woman.  It was true.  It was so true that, in a sudden longing to see some friendly face, she could think of no one else but of Mrs Neale, the charwoman.  She had no acquaintances of her own.  Nobody would miss her in a social way.  It must not be imagined that the Widow Verloc had forgotten her mother.  This was not so.  Winnie had been a good daughter because she had been a devoted sister.  Her mother had always leaned on her for support.  No consolation or advice could be expected there.  Now that Stevie was dead the bond seemed to be broken.  She could not face the old woman with the horrible tale.  Moreover, it was too far.  The river was her present destination.  Mrs Verloc tried to forget her mother.

Each step cost her an effort of will which seemed the last possible.  Mrs Verloc had dragged herself past the red glow of the eating-house window.  “To the bridge—and over I go,” she repeated to herself with fierce obstinacy.  She put out her hand just in time to steady herself against a lamp-post.  “I’ll never get there before morning,” she thought.  The fear of death paralysed her efforts to escape the gallows.  It seemed to her she had been staggering in that street for hours.  “I’ll never get there,” she thought.  “They’ll find me knocking about the streets.  It’s too far.”  She held on, panting under her black veil.

“The drop given was fourteen feet.”

She pushed the lamp-post away from her violently, and found herself walking.  But another wave of faintness overtook her like a great sea, washing away her heart clean out of her breast.  “I will never get there,” she muttered, suddenly arrested, swaying lightly where she stood.  “Never.”

And perceiving the utter impossibility of walking as far as the nearest bridge, Mrs Verloc thought of a flight abroad.

It came to her suddenly.  Murderers escaped.  They escaped abroad.  Spain or California.  Mere names.  The vast world created for the glory of man was only a vast blank to Mrs Verloc.  She did not know which way to turn.  Murderers had friends, relations, helpers—they had knowledge.  She had nothing.  She was the most lonely of murderers that ever struck a mortal blow.  She was alone in London: and the whole town of marvels and mud, with its maze of streets and its mass of lights, was sunk in a hopeless night, rested at the bottom of a black abyss from which no unaided woman could hope to scramble out.
She swayed forward, and made a fresh start blindly, with an awful dread of falling down; but at the end of a few steps, unexpectedly, she found a sensation of support, of security.  Raising her head, she saw a man’s face peering closely at her veil.  Comrade Ossipon was not afraid of strange women, and no feeling of false delicacy could prevent him from striking an acquaintance with a woman apparently very much intoxicated.  Comrade Ossipon was interested in women.  He held up this one between his two large palms, peering at her in a business-like way till he heard her say faintly “Mr Ossipon!” and then he very nearly let her drop to the ground.

“Mrs Verloc!” he exclaimed.  “You here!”

It seemed impossible to him that she should have been drinking.  But one never knows.  He did not go into that question, but attentive not to discourage kind fate surrendering to him the widow of Comrade Verloc, he tried to draw her to his breast.  To his astonishment she came quite easily, and even rested on his arm for a moment before she attempted to disengage herself.  Comrade Ossipon would not be brusque with kind fate.  He withdrew his arm in a natural way.

“You recognised me,” she faltered out, standing before him, fairly steady on her legs.

“Of course I did,” said Ossipon with perfect readiness.  “I was afraid you were going to fall.  I’ve thought of you too often lately not to recognise you anywhere, at any time.  I’ve always thought of you—ever since I first set eyes on you.”

Mrs Verloc seemed not to hear.  “You were coming to the shop?” she said nervously.

“Yes; at once,” answered Ossipon.  “Directly I read the paper.”

In fact, Comrade Ossipon had been skulking for a good two hours in the neighbourhood of Brett Street, unable to make up his mind for a bold move.  The robust anarchist was not exactly a bold conqueror.  He remembered that Mrs Verloc had never responded to his glances by the slightest sign of encouragement.  Besides, he thought the shop might be watched by the police, and Comrade Ossipon did not wish the police to form an exaggerated notion of his revolutionary sympathies.  Even now he did not know precisely what to do.  In comparison with his usual amatory speculations this was a big and serious undertaking.  He ignored how much there was in it and how far he would have to go in order to get hold of what there was to get—supposing there was a chance at all.  These perplexities checking his elation imparted to his tone a soberness well in keeping with the circumstances.

“May I ask you where you were going?” he inquired in a subdued voice.

“Don’t ask me!” cried Mrs Verloc with a shuddering, repressed violence.  All her strong vitality recoiled from the idea of death.  “Never mind where I was going. . . .”

Ossipon concluded that she was very much excited but perfectly sober.  She remained silent by his side for moment, then all at once she did something which he did not expect.  She slipped her hand under his arm.  He was startled by the act itself certainly, and quite as much too by the palpably resolute character of this movement.  But this being a delicate affair, Comrade Ossipon behaved with delicacy.  He contented himself by pressing the hand slightly against his robust ribs.  At the same time he felt himself being impelled forward, and yielded to the impulse.  At the end of Brett Street he became aware of being directed to the left.  He submitted.

The fruiterer at the corner had put out the blazing glory of his oranges and lemons, and Brett Place was all darkness, interspersed with the misty halos of the few lamps defining its triangular shape, with a cluster of three lights on one stand in the middle.  The dark forms of the man and woman glided slowly arm in arm along the walls with a loverlike and homeless aspect in the miserable night.

“What would you say if I were to tell you that I was going to find you?” Mrs Verloc asked, gripping his arm with force.
“I would say that you couldn’t find anyone more ready to help you in your trouble,” answered Ossipon, with a notion of making tremendous headway.  In fact, the progress of this delicate affair was almost taking his breath away.

“In my trouble!” Mrs Verloc repeated slowly.

“Yes.”

“And do you know what my trouble is?” she whispered with strange intensity.

“Ten minutes after seeing the evening paper,” explained Ossipon with ardour, “I met a fellow whom you may have seen once or twice at the shop perhaps, and I had a talk with him which left no doubt whatever in my mind.  Then I started for here, wondering whether you—I’ve been fond of you beyond words ever since I set eyes on your face,” he cried, as if unable to command his feelings.

Comrade Ossipon assumed correctly that no woman was capable of wholly disbelieving such a statement.  But he did not know that Mrs Verloc accepted it with all the fierceness the instinct of self-preservation puts into the grip of a drowning person.  To the widow of Mr Verloc the robust anarchist was like a radiant messenger of life.

They walked slowly, in step.  “I thought so,” Mrs Verloc murmured faintly.

“You’ve read it in my eyes,” suggested Ossipon with great assurance.

“Yes,” she breathed out into his inclined ear.

“A love like mine could not be concealed from a woman like you,” he went on, trying to detach his mind from material considerations such as the business value of the shop, and the amount of money Mr Verloc might have left in the bank.  He applied himself to the sentimental side of the affair.  In his heart of hearts he was a little shocked at his success.  Verloc had been a good fellow, and certainly a very decent husband as far as one could see.  However, Comrade Ossipon was not going to quarrel with his luck for the sake of a dead man.  Resolutely he suppressed his sympathy for the ghost of Comrade Verloc, and went on.

“I could not conceal it.  I was too full of you.  I daresay you could not help seeing it in my eyes.  But I could not guess it.  You were always so distant. . . .”

“What else did you expect?” burst out Mrs Verloc.  “I was a respectable woman—”

She paused, then added, as if speaking to herself, in sinister resentment: “Till he made me what I am.”
Ossipon let that pass, and took up his running.  “He never did seem to me to be quite worthy of you,” he began, throwing loyalty to the winds.  “You were worthy of a better fate.”

Mrs Verloc interrupted bitterly:

“Better fate!  He cheated me out of seven years of life.”

“You seemed to live so happily with him.”  Ossipon tried to exculpate the lukewarmness of his past conduct.  “It’s that what’s made me timid.  You seemed to love him.  I was surprised—and jealous,” he added.

“Love him!” Mrs Verloc cried out in a whisper, full of scorn and rage.  “Love him!  I was a good wife to him.  I am a respectable woman.  You thought I loved him!  You did!  Look here, Tom—”

The sound of this name thrilled Comrade Ossipon with pride.  For his name was Alexander, and he was called Tom by arrangement with the most familiar of his intimates.  It was a name of friendship—of moments of expansion.  He had no idea that she had ever heard it used by anybody.  It was apparent that she had not only caught it, but had treasured it in her memory—perhaps in her heart.

“Look here, Tom!  I was a young girl.  I was done up.  I was tired.  I had two people depending on what I could do, and it did seem as if I couldn’t do any more.  Two people—mother and the boy.  He was much more mine than mother’s.  I sat up nights and nights with him on my lap, all alone upstairs, when I wasn’t more than eight years old myself.  And then—He was mine, I tell you. . . . You can’t understand that.  No man can understand it.  What was I to do?  There was a young fellow—”

The memory of the early romance with the young butcher survived, tenacious, like the image of a glimpsed ideal in that heart quailing before the fear of the gallows and full of revolt against death.

“That was the man I loved then,” went on the widow of Mr Verloc.  “I suppose he could see it in my eyes too.  Five and twenty shillings a week, and his father threatened to kick him out of the business if he made such a fool of himself as to marry a girl with a crippled mother and a crazy idiot of a boy on her hands.  But he would hang about me, till one evening I found the courage to slam the door in his face.  I had to do it.  I loved him dearly.  Five and twenty shillings a week!  There was that other man—a good lodger.  What is a girl to do?  Could I’ve gone on the streets?  He seemed kind.  He wanted me, anyhow.  What was I to do with mother and that poor boy?  Eh?  I said yes.  He seemed good-natured, he was freehanded, he had money, he never said anything.  Seven years—seven years a good wife to him, the kind, the good, the generous, the—And he loved me.  Oh yes.  He loved me till I sometimes wished myself—Seven years.  Seven years a wife to him.  And do you know what he was, that dear friend of yours?  Do you know what he was?  He was a devil!”

The superhuman vehemence of that whispered statement completely stunned Comrade Ossipon.  Winnie Verloc turning about held him by both arms, facing him under the falling mist in the darkness and solitude of Brett Place, in which all sounds of life seemed lost as if in a triangular well of asphalt and bricks, of blind houses and unfeeling stones.

“No; I didn’t know,” he declared, with a sort of flabby stupidity, whose comical aspect was lost upon a woman haunted by the fear of the gallows, “but I do now.  I—I understand,” he floundered on, his mind speculating as to what sort of atrocities Verloc could have practised under the sleepy, placid appearances of his married estate.  It was positively awful.  “I understand,” he repeated, and then by a sudden inspiration uttered an—“Unhappy woman!” of lofty commiseration instead of the more familiar “Poor darling!” of his usual practice.  This was no usual case.  He felt conscious of something abnormal going on, while he never lost sight of the greatness of the stake.  “Unhappy, brave woman!”

He was glad to have discovered that variation; but he could discover nothing else.

“Ah, but he is dead now,” was the best he could do.  And he put a remarkable amount of animosity into his guarded exclamation.  Mrs Verloc caught at his arm with a sort of frenzy.

“You guessed then he was dead,” she murmured, as if beside herself.  “You!  You guessed what I had to do.  Had to!”

There were suggestions of triumph, relief, gratitude in the indefinable tone of these words.  It engrossed the whole attention of Ossipon to the detriment of mere literal sense.  He wondered what was up with her, why she had worked herself into this state of wild excitement.  He even began to wonder whether the hidden causes of that Greenwich Park affair did not lie deep in the unhappy circumstances of the Verlocs’ married life.  He went so far as to suspect Mr Verloc of having selected that extraordinary manner of committing suicide.  By Jove! that would account for the utter inanity and wrong-headedness of the thing.  No anarchist manifestation was required by the circumstances.  Quite the contrary; and Verloc was as well aware of that as any other revolutionist of his standing.  What an immense joke if Verloc had simply made fools of the whole of Europe, of the revolutionary world, of the police, of the press, and of the cocksure Professor as well.  Indeed, thought Ossipon, in astonishment, it seemed almost certain that he did!  Poor beggar!  It struck him as very possible that of that household of two it wasn’t precisely the man who was the devil.

Alexander Ossipon, nicknamed the Doctor, was naturally inclined to think indulgently of his men friends.  He eyed Mrs Verloc hanging on his arm.  Of his women friends he thought in a specially practical way.  Why Mrs Verloc should exclaim at his knowledge of Mr Verloc’s death, which was no guess at all, did not disturb him beyond measure.  They often talked like lunatics.  But he was curious to know how she had been informed.  The papers could tell her nothing beyond the mere fact: the man blown to pieces in Greenwich Park not having been identified.  It was inconceivable on any theory that Verloc should have given her an inkling of his intention—whatever it was.  This problem interested Comrade Ossipon immensely.  He stopped short.  They had gone then along the three sides of Brett Place, and were near the end of Brett Street again.

“How did you first come to hear of it?” he asked in a tone he tried to render appropriate to the character of the revelations which had been made to him by the woman at his side.

She shook violently for a while before she answered in a listless voice.

“From the police.  A chief inspector came, Chief Inspector Heat he said he was.  He showed me—”

Mrs Verloc choked.  “Oh, Tom, they had to gather him up with a shovel.”

Her breast heaved with dry sobs.  In a moment Ossipon found his tongue.

“The police!  Do you mean to say the police came already?  That Chief Inspector Heat himself actually came to tell you.”

“Yes,” she confirmed in the same listless tone.  “He came just like this.  He came.  I didn’t know.  He showed me a piece of overcoat, and—just like that.  Do you know this? he says.”

“Heat!  Heat!  And what did he do?”

Mrs Verloc’s head dropped.  “Nothing.  He did nothing.  He went away.  The police were on that man’s side,” she murmured tragically.  “Another one came too.”

“Another—another inspector, do you mean?” asked Ossipon, in great excitement, and very much in the tone of a scared child.

“I don’t know.  He came.  He looked like a foreigner.  He may have been one of them Embassy people.”

Comrade Ossipon nearly collapsed under this new shock.

“Embassy!  Are you aware what you are saying?  What Embassy?  What on earth do you mean by Embassy?”

“It’s that place in Chesham Square.  The people he cursed so.  I don’t know.  What does it matter!”

“And that fellow, what did he do or say to you?”

“I don’t remember. . . . Nothing . . . . I don’t care.  Don’t ask me,” she pleaded in a weary voice.

“All right.  I won’t,” assented Ossipon tenderly.  And he meant it too, not because he was touched by the pathos of the pleading voice, but because he felt himself losing his footing in the depths of this tenebrous affair.  Police!  Embassy!  Phew!  For fear of adventuring his intelligence into ways where its natural lights might fail to guide it safely he dismissed resolutely all suppositions, surmises, and theories out of his mind.  He had the woman there, absolutely flinging herself at him, and that was the principal consideration.  But after what he had heard nothing could astonish him any more.  And when Mrs Verloc, as if startled suddenly out of a dream of safety, began to urge upon him wildly the necessity of an immediate flight on the Continent, he did not exclaim in the least.  He simply said with unaffected regret that there was no train till the morning, and stood looking thoughtfully at her face, veiled in black net, in the light of a gas lamp veiled in a gauze of mist.

Near him, her black form merged in the night, like a figure half chiselled out of a block of black stone.  It was impossible to say what she knew, how deep she was involved with policemen and Embassies.  But if she wanted to get away, it was not for him to object.  He was anxious to be off himself.  He felt that the business, the shop so strangely familiar to chief inspectors and members of foreign Embassies, was not the place for him.  That must be dropped.  But there was the rest.  These savings.  The money!

“You must hide me till the morning somewhere,” she said in a dismayed voice.

“Fact is, my dear, I can’t take you where I live.  I share the room with a friend.”

He was somewhat dismayed himself.  In the morning the blessed ’tecs will be out in all the stations, no doubt.  And if they once got hold of her, for one reason or another she would be lost to him indeed.

“But you must.  Don’t you care for me at all—at all?  What are you thinking of?”

She said this violently, but she let her clasped hands fall in discouragement.  There was a silence, while the mist fell, and darkness reigned undisturbed over Brett Place.  Not a soul, not even the vagabond, lawless, and amorous soul of a cat, came near the man and the woman facing each other.

“It would be possible perhaps to find a safe lodging somewhere,” Ossipon spoke at last.  “But the truth is, my dear, I have not enough money to go and try with—only a few pence.  We revolutionists are not rich.”

He had fifteen shillings in his pocket.  He added:

“And there’s the journey before us, too—first thing in the morning at that.”

She did not move, made no sound, and Comrade Ossipon’s heart sank a little.  Apparently she had no suggestion to offer.  Suddenly she clutched at her breast, as if she had felt a sharp pain there.

“But I have,” she gasped.  “I have the money.  I have enough money.  Tom!  Let us go from here.”

“How much have you got?” he inquired, without stirring to her tug; for he was a cautious man.

“I have the money, I tell you.  All the money.”

“What do you mean by it?  All the money there was in the bank, or what?” he asked incredulously, but ready not to be surprised at anything in the way of luck.

“Yes, yes!” she said nervously.  “All there was.  I’ve it all.”

“How on earth did you manage to get hold of it already?” he marvelled.

“He gave it to me,” she murmured, suddenly subdued and trembling.  Comrade Ossipon put down his rising surprise with a firm hand.

“Why, then—we are saved,” he uttered slowly.

She leaned forward, and sank against his breast.  He welcomed her there.  She had all the money.  Her hat was in the way of very marked effusion; her veil too.  He was adequate in his manifestations, but no more.  She received them without resistance and without abandonment, passively, as if only half-sensible.  She freed herself from his lax embraces without difficulty.

“You will save me, Tom,” she broke out, recoiling, but still keeping her hold on him by the two lapels of his damp coat.  “Save me.  Hide me.  Don’t let them have me.  You must kill me first.  I couldn’t do it myself—I couldn’t, I couldn’t—not even for what I am afraid of.”

She was confoundedly bizarre, he thought.  She was beginning to inspire him with an indefinite uneasiness.  He said surlily, for he was busy with important thoughts:

“What the devil are you afraid of?”

“Haven’t you guessed what I was driven to do!” cried the woman.  Distracted by the vividness of her dreadful apprehensions, her head ringing with forceful words, that kept the horror of her position before her mind, she had imagined her incoherence to be clearness itself.  She had no conscience of how little she had audibly said in the disjointed phrases completed only in her thought.  She had felt the relief of a full confession, and she gave a special meaning to every sentence spoken by Comrade Ossipon, whose knowledge did not in the least resemble her own.  “Haven’t you guessed what I was driven to do!”  Her voice fell.  “You needn’t be long in guessing then what I am afraid of,” she continued, in a bitter and sombre murmur.  “I won’t have it.  I won’t.  I won’t.  I won’t.  You must promise to kill me first!”  She shook the lapels of his coat.  “It must never be!”

He assured her curtly that no promises on his part were necessary, but he took good care not to contradict her in set terms, because he had had much to do with excited women, and he was inclined in general to let his experience guide his conduct in preference to applying his sagacity to each special case.  His sagacity in this case was busy in other directions.  Women’s words fell into water, but the shortcomings of time-tables remained.  The insular nature of Great Britain obtruded itself upon his notice in an odious form.  “Might just as well be put under lock and key every night,” he thought irritably, as nonplussed as though he had a wall to scale with the woman on his back.  Suddenly he slapped his forehead.  He had by dint of cudgelling his brains just thought of the Southampton—St Malo service.  The boat left about midnight.  There was a train at 10.30.  He became cheery and ready to act.

“From Waterloo.  Plenty of time.  We are all right after all. . . . What’s the matter now?  This isn’t the way,” he protested.

Mrs Verloc, having hooked her arm into his, was trying to drag him into Brett Street again.

“I’ve forgotten to shut the shop door as I went out,” she whispered, terribly agitated.

The shop and all that was in it had ceased to interest Comrade Ossipon.  He knew how to limit his desires.  He was on the point of saying “What of that?  Let it be,” but he refrained.  He disliked argument about trifles.  He even mended his pace considerably on the thought that she might have left the money in the drawer.  But his willingness lagged behind her feverish impatience.

The shop seemed to be quite dark at first.  The door stood ajar.  Mrs Verloc, leaning against the front, gasped out:

“Nobody has been in.  Look!  The light—the light in the parlour.”

Ossipon, stretching his head forward, saw a faint gleam in the darkness of the shop.

“There is,” he said.

“I forgot it.” Mrs Verloc’s voice came from behind her veil faintly.  And as he stood waiting for her to enter first, she said louder: “Go in and put it out—or I’ll go mad.”

He made no immediate objection to this proposal, so strangely motived.  “Where’s all that money?” he asked.

“On me!  Go, Tom.  Quick!  Put it out. . . . Go in!” she cried, seizing him by both shoulders from behind.

Not prepared for a display of physical force, Comrade Ossipon stumbled far into the shop before her push.  He was astonished at the strength of the woman and scandalised by her proceedings.  But he did not retrace his steps in order to remonstrate with her severely in the street.  He was beginning to be disagreeably impressed by her fantastic behaviour.  Moreover, this or never was the time to humour the woman.  Comrade Ossipon avoided easily the end of the counter, and approached calmly the glazed door of the parlour.  The curtain over the panes being drawn back a little he, by a very natural impulse, looked in, just as he made ready to turn the handle.  He looked in without a thought, without intention, without curiosity of any sort.  He looked in because he could not help looking in.  He looked in, and discovered Mr Verloc reposing quietly on the sofa.

A yell coming from the innermost depths of his chest died out unheard and transformed into a sort of greasy, sickly taste on his lips.  At the same time the mental personality of Comrade Ossipon executed a frantic leap backward.  But his body, left thus without intellectual guidance, held on to the door handle with the unthinking force of an instinct.  The robust anarchist did not even totter.  And he stared, his face close to the glass, his eyes protruding out of his head.  He would have given anything to get away, but his returning reason informed him that it would not do to let go the door handle.  What was it—madness, a nightmare, or a trap into which he had been decoyed with fiendish artfulness?  Why—what for?  He did not know.  Without any sense of guilt in his breast, in the full peace of his conscience as far as these people were concerned, the idea that he would be murdered for mysterious reasons by the couple Verloc passed not so much across his mind as across the pit of his stomach, and went out, leaving behind a trail of sickly faintness—an indisposition.  Comrade Ossipon did not feel very well in a very special way for a moment—a long moment.  And he stared.  Mr Verloc lay very still meanwhile, simulating sleep for reasons of his own, while that savage woman of his was guarding the door—invisible and silent in the dark and deserted street.  Was all this a some sort of terrifying arrangement invented by the police for his especial benefit?  His modesty shrank from that explanation.

But the true sense of the scene he was beholding came to Ossipon through the contemplation of the hat.  It seemed an extraordinary thing, an ominous object, a sign.  Black, and rim upward, it lay on the floor before the couch as if prepared to receive the contributions of pence from people who would come presently to behold Mr Verloc in the fullness of his domestic ease reposing on a sofa.  From the hat the eyes of the robust anarchist wandered to the displaced table, gazed at the broken dish for a time, received a kind of optical shock from observing a white gleam under the imperfectly closed eyelids of the man on the couch.  Mr Verloc did not seem so much asleep now as lying down with a bent head and looking insistently at his left breast.  And when Comrade Ossipon had made out the handle of the knife he turned away from the glazed door, and retched violently.

The crash of the street door flung to made his very soul leap in a panic.  This house with its harmless tenant could still be made a trap of—a trap of a terrible kind.  Comrade Ossipon had no settled conception now of what was happening to him.  Catching his thigh against the end of the counter, he spun round, staggered with a cry of pain, felt in the distracting clatter of the bell his arms pinned to his side by a convulsive hug, while the cold lips of a woman moved creepily on his very ear to form the words:

“Policeman!  He has seen me!”

He ceased to struggle; she never let him go.  Her hands had locked themselves with an inseparable twist of fingers on his robust back.  While the footsteps approached, they breathed quickly, breast to breast, with hard, laboured breaths, as if theirs had been the attitude of a deadly struggle, while, in fact, it was the attitude of deadly fear.  And the time was long.

The constable on the beat had in truth seen something of Mrs Verloc; only coming from the lighted thoroughfare at the other end of Brett Street, she had been no more to him than a flutter in the darkness.  And he was not even quite sure that there had been a flutter.  He had no reason to hurry up.  On coming abreast of the shop he observed that it had been closed early.  There was nothing very unusual in that.  The men on duty had special instructions about that shop: what went on about there was not to be meddled with unless absolutely disorderly, but any observations made were to be reported.  There were no observations to make; but from a sense of duty and for the peace of his conscience, owing also to that doubtful flutter of the darkness, the constable crossed the road, and tried the door.  The spring latch, whose key was reposing for ever off duty in the late Mr Verloc’s waistcoat pocket, held as well as usual.  While the conscientious officer was shaking the handle, Ossipon felt the cold lips of the woman stirring again creepily against his very ear:

“If he comes in kill me—kill me, Tom.”

The constable moved away, flashing as he passed the light of his dark lantern, merely for form’s sake, at the shop window.  For a moment longer the man and the woman inside stood motionless, panting, breast to breast; then her fingers came unlocked, her arms fell by her side slowly.  Ossipon leaned against the counter.  The robust anarchist wanted support badly.  This was awful.  He was almost too disgusted for speech.  Yet he managed to utter a plaintive thought, showing at least that he realised his position.

“Only a couple of minutes later and you’d have made me blunder against the fellow poking about here with his damned dark lantern.”

The widow of Mr Verloc, motionless in the middle of the shop, said insistently:

“Go in and put that light out, Tom.  It will drive me crazy.”

She saw vaguely his vehement gesture of refusal.  Nothing in the world would have induced Ossipon to go into the parlour.  He was not superstitious, but there was too much blood on the floor; a beastly pool of it all round the hat.  He judged he had been already far too near that corpse for his peace of mind—for the safety of his neck, perhaps!

“At the meter then!  There.  Look.  In that corner.”

The robust form of Comrade Ossipon, striding brusque and shadowy across the shop, squatted in a corner obediently; but this obedience was without grace.  He fumbled nervously—and suddenly in the sound of a muttered curse the light behind the glazed door flicked out to a gasping, hysterical sigh of a woman.  Night, the inevitable reward of men’s faithful labours on this earth, night had fallen on Mr Verloc, the tried revolutionist—“one of the old lot”—the humble guardian of society; the invaluable Secret Agent [delta] of Baron Stott-Wartenheim’s despatches; a servant of law and order, faithful, trusted, accurate, admirable, with perhaps one single amiable weakness: the idealistic belief in being loved for himself.

Ossipon groped his way back through the stuffy atmosphere, as black as ink now, to the counter.  The voice of Mrs Verloc, standing in the middle of the shop, vibrated after him in that blackness with a desperate protest.

“I will not be hanged, Tom.  I will not—”

She broke off.  Ossipon from the counter issued a warning: “Don’t shout like this,” then seemed to reflect profoundly.  “You did this thing quite by yourself?” he inquired in a hollow voice, but with an appearance of masterful calmness which filled Mrs Verloc’s heart with grateful confidence in his protecting strength.

“Yes,” she whispered, invisible.

“I wouldn’t have believed it possible,” he muttered.  “Nobody would.”  She heard him move about and the snapping of a lock in the parlour door.  Comrade Ossipon had turned the key on Mr Verloc’s repose; and this he did not from reverence for its eternal nature or any other obscurely sentimental consideration, but for the precise reason that he was not at all sure that there was not someone else hiding somewhere in the house.  He did not believe the woman, or rather he was incapable by now of judging what could be true, possible, or even probable in this astounding universe.  He was terrified out of all capacity for belief or disbelief in regard of this extraordinary affair, which began with police inspectors and Embassies and would end goodness knows where—on the scaffold for someone.  He was terrified at the thought that he could not prove the use he made of his time ever since seven o’clock, for he had been skulking about Brett Street.  He was terrified at this savage woman who had brought him in there, and would probably saddle him with complicity, at least if he were not careful.  He was terrified at the rapidity with which he had been involved in such dangers—decoyed into it.  It was some twenty minutes since he had met her—not more.

The voice of Mrs Verloc rose subdued, pleading piteously: “Don’t let them hang me, Tom!  Take me out of the country.  I’ll work for you.  I’ll slave for you.  I’ll love you.  I’ve no one in the world. . . .  Who would look at me if you don’t!”  She ceased for a moment; then in the depths of the loneliness made round her by an insignificant thread of blood trickling off the handle of a knife, she found a dreadful inspiration to her—who had been the respectable girl of the Belgravian mansion, the loyal, respectable wife of Mr Verloc.  “I won’t ask you to marry me,” she breathed out in shame-faced accents.

She moved a step forward in the darkness.  He was terrified at her.  He would not have been surprised if she had suddenly produced another knife destined for his breast.  He certainly would have made no resistance.  He had really not enough fortitude in him just then to tell her to keep back.  But he inquired in a cavernous, strange tone: “Was he asleep?”

“No,” she cried, and went on rapidly.  “He wasn’t.  Not he.  He had been telling me that nothing could touch him.  After taking the boy away from under my very eyes to kill him—the loving, innocent, harmless lad.  My own, I tell you.  He was lying on the couch quite easy—after killing the boy—my boy.  I would have gone on the streets to get out of his sight.  And he says to me like this: ‘Come here,’ after telling me I had helped to kill the boy.  You hear, Tom?  He says like this: ‘Come here,’ after taking my very heart out of me along with the boy to smash in the dirt.”

She ceased, then dreamily repeated twice: “Blood and dirt.  Blood and dirt.”  A great light broke upon Comrade Ossipon.  It was that half-witted lad then who had perished in the park.  And the fooling of everybody all round appeared more complete than ever—colossal.  He exclaimed scientifically, in the extremity of his astonishment: “The degenerate—by heavens!”

“Come here.”  The voice of Mrs Verloc rose again.  “What did he think I was made of?  Tell me, Tom.  Come here!  Me!  Like this!  I had been looking at the knife, and I thought I would come then if he wanted me so much.  Oh yes!  I came—for the last time. . . . With the knife.”

He was excessively terrified at her—the sister of the degenerate—a degenerate herself of a murdering type . . . or else of the lying type.  Comrade Ossipon might have been said to be terrified scientifically in addition to all other kinds of fear.  It was an immeasurable and composite funk, which from its very excess gave him in the dark a false appearance of calm and thoughtful deliberation.  For he moved and spoke with difficulty, being as if half frozen in his will and mind—and no one could see his ghastly face.  He felt half dead.

He leaped a foot high.  Unexpectedly Mrs Verloc had desecrated the unbroken reserved decency of her home by a shrill and terrible shriek.

“Help, Tom!  Save me.  I won’t be hanged!”

He rushed forward, groping for her mouth with a silencing hand, and the shriek died out.  But in his rush he had knocked her over.  He felt her now clinging round his legs, and his terror reached its culminating point, became a sort of intoxication, entertained delusions, acquired the characteristics of delirium tremens.  He positively saw snakes now.  He saw the woman twined round him like a snake, not to be shaken off.  She was not deadly.  She was death itself—the companion of life.

Mrs Verloc, as if relieved by the outburst, was very far from behaving noisily now.  She was pitiful.

“Tom, you can’t throw me off now,” she murmured from the floor.  “Not unless you crush my head under your heel.  I won’t leave you.”

“Get up,” said Ossipon.

His face was so pale as to be quite visible in the profound black darkness of the shop; while Mrs Verloc, veiled, had no face, almost no discernible form.  The trembling of something small and white, a flower in her hat, marked her place, her movements.

It rose in the blackness.  She had got up from the floor, and Ossipon regretted not having run out at once into the street.  But he perceived easily that it would not do.  It would not do.  She would run after him.  She would pursue him shrieking till she sent every policeman within hearing in chase.  And then goodness only knew what she would say of him.  He was so frightened that for a moment the insane notion of strangling her in the dark passed through his mind.  And he became more frightened than ever!  She had him!  He saw himself living in abject terror in some obscure hamlet in Spain or Italy; till some fine morning they found him dead too, with a knife in his breast—like Mr Verloc.  He sighed deeply.  He dared not move.  And Mrs Verloc waited in silence the good pleasure of her saviour, deriving comfort from his reflective silence.

Suddenly he spoke up in an almost natural voice.  His reflections had come to an end.

“Let’s get out, or we will lose the train.”

“Where are we going to, Tom?” she asked timidly.  Mrs Verloc was no longer a free woman.

“Let’s get to Paris first, the best way we can. . . . Go out first, and see if the way’s clear.”

She obeyed.  Her voice came subdued through the cautiously opened door.

“It’s all right.”

Ossipon came out.  Notwithstanding his endeavours to be gentle, the cracked bell clattered behind the closed door in the empty shop, as if trying in vain to warn the reposing Mr Verloc of the final departure of his wife—accompanied by his friend.

In the hansom they presently picked up, the robust anarchist became explanatory.  He was still awfully pale, with eyes that seemed to have sunk a whole half-inch into his tense face.  But he seemed to have thought of everything with extraordinary method.

“When we arrive,” he discoursed in a queer, monotonous tone, “you must go into the station ahead of me, as if we did not know each other.  I will take the tickets, and slip in yours into your hand as I pass you.  Then you will go into the first-class ladies’ waiting-room, and sit there till ten minutes before the train starts.  Then you come out.  I will be outside.  You go in first on the platform, as if you did not know me.  There may be eyes watching there that know what’s what.  Alone you are only a woman going off by train.  I am known.  With me, you may be guessed at as Mrs Verloc running away.  Do you understand, my dear?” he added, with an effort.

“Yes,” said Mrs Verloc, sitting there against him in the hansom all rigid with the dread of the gallows and the fear of death.  “Yes, Tom.”  And she added to herself, like an awful refrain: “The drop given was fourteen feet.”

Ossipon, not looking at her, and with a face like a fresh plaster cast of himself after a wasting illness, said: “By-the-by, I ought to have the money for the tickets now.”

Mrs Verloc, undoing some hooks of her bodice, while she went on staring ahead beyond the splashboard, handed over to him the new pigskin pocket-book.  He received it without a word, and seemed to plunge it deep somewhere into his very breast.  Then he slapped his coat on the outside.

All this was done without the exchange of a single glance; they were like two people looking out for the first sight of a desired goal.  It was not till the hansom swung round a corner and towards the bridge that Ossipon opened his lips again.

“Do you know how much money there is in that thing?” he asked, as if addressing slowly some hobgoblin sitting between the ears of the horse.

“No,” said Mrs Verloc.  “He gave it to me.  I didn’t count.  I thought nothing of it at the time.  Afterwards—”

She moved her right hand a little.  It was so expressive that little movement of that right hand which had struck the deadly blow into a man’s heart less than an hour before that Ossipon could not repress a shudder.  He exaggerated it then purposely, and muttered:

“I am cold.  I got chilled through.”

Mrs Verloc looked straight ahead at the perspective of her escape.  Now and then, like a sable streamer blown across a road, the words “The drop given was fourteen feet” got in the way of her tense stare.  Through her black veil the whites of her big eyes gleamed lustrously like the eyes of a masked woman.

Ossipon’s rigidity had something business-like, a queer official expression.  He was heard again all of a sudden, as though he had released a catch in order to speak.

“Look here!  Do you know whether your—whether he kept his account at the bank in his own name or in some other name.”

Mrs Verloc turned upon him her masked face and the big white gleam of her eyes.

“Other name?” she said thoughtfully.

“Be exact in what you say,” Ossipon lectured in the swift motion of the hansom.  “It’s extremely important.  I will explain to you.  The bank has the numbers of these notes.  If they were paid to him in his own name, then when his—his death becomes known, the notes may serve to track us since we have no other money.  You have no other money on you?”

She shook her head negatively.

“None whatever?” he insisted.

“A few coppers.”

“It would be dangerous in that case.  The money would have then to be dealt specially with.  Very specially.  We’d have perhaps to lose more than half the amount in order to get these notes changed in a certain safe place I know of in Paris.  In the other case I mean if he had his account and got paid out under some other name—say Smith, for instance—the money is perfectly safe to use.  You understand?  The bank has no means of knowing that Mr Verloc and, say, Smith are one and the same person.  Do you see how important it is that you should make no mistake in answering me?  Can you answer that query at all?  Perhaps not.  Eh?”

She said composedly:

“I remember now!  He didn’t bank in his own name.  He told me once that it was on deposit in the name of Prozor.”

“You are sure?”

“Certain.”

“You don’t think the bank had any knowledge of his real name?  Or anybody in the bank or—”

She shrugged her shoulders.

“How can I know?  Is it likely, Tom?

“No.  I suppose it’s not likely.  It would have been more comfortable to know. . . . Here we are.  Get out first, and walk straight in.  Move smartly.”

He remained behind, and paid the cabman out of his own loose silver.  The programme traced by his minute foresight was carried out.  When Mrs Verloc, with her ticket for St Malo in her hand, entered the ladies’ waiting-room, Comrade Ossipon walked into the bar, and in seven minutes absorbed three goes of hot brandy and water.

“Trying to drive out a cold,” he explained to the barmaid, with a friendly nod and a grimacing smile.  Then he came out, bringing out from that festive interlude the face of a man who had drunk at the very Fountain of Sorrow.  He raised his eyes to the clock.  It was time.  He waited.

Punctual, Mrs Verloc came out, with her veil down, and all black—black as commonplace death itself, crowned with a few cheap and pale flowers.  She passed close to a little group of men who were laughing, but whose laughter could have been struck dead by a single word.  Her walk was indolent, but her back was straight, and Comrade Ossipon looked after it in terror before making a start himself.

The train was drawn up, with hardly anybody about its row of open doors.  Owing to the time of the year and to the abominable weather there were hardly any passengers.  Mrs Verloc walked slowly along the line of empty compartments till Ossipon touched her elbow from behind.

“In here.”

She got in, and he remained on the platform looking about.  She bent forward, and in a whisper:

“What is it, Tom?  Is there any danger?  Wait a moment.  There’s the guard.”

She saw him accost the man in uniform.  They talked for a while.  She heard the guard say “Very well, sir,” and saw him touch his cap.  Then Ossipon came back, saying: “I told him not to let anybody get into our compartment.”

She was leaning forward on her seat.  “You think of everything. . . . You’ll get me off, Tom?” she asked in a gust of anguish, lifting her veil brusquely to look at her saviour.

She had uncovered a face like adamant.  And out of this face the eyes looked on, big, dry, enlarged, lightless, burnt out like two black holes in the white, shining globes.

“There is no danger,” he said, gazing into them with an earnestness almost rapt, which to Mrs Verloc, flying from the gallows, seemed to be full of force and tenderness.  This devotion deeply moved her—and the adamantine face lost the stern rigidity of its terror.  Comrade Ossipon gazed at it as no lover ever gazed at his mistress’s face.  Alexander Ossipon, anarchist, nicknamed the Doctor, author of a medical (and improper) pamphlet, late lecturer on the social aspects of hygiene to working men’s clubs, was free from the trammels of conventional morality—but he submitted to the rule of science.  He was scientific, and he gazed scientifically at that woman, the sister of a degenerate, a degenerate herself—of a murdering type.  He gazed at her, and invoked Lombroso, as an Italian peasant recommends himself to his favourite saint.  He gazed scientifically.  He gazed at her cheeks, at her nose, at her eyes, at her ears. . . . Bad! . . . Fatal!  Mrs Verloc’s pale lips parting, slightly relaxed under his passionately attentive gaze, he gazed also at her teeth. . . . Not a doubt remained . . . a murdering type. . . . If Comrade Ossipon did not recommend his terrified soul to Lombroso, it was only because on scientific grounds he could not believe that he carried about him such a thing as a soul.  But he had in him the scientific spirit, which moved him to testify on the platform of a railway station in nervous jerky phrases.

“He was an extraordinary lad, that brother of yours.  Most interesting to study.  A perfect type in a way.  Perfect!”

He spoke scientifically in his secret fear.  And Mrs Verloc, hearing these words of commendation vouchsafed to her beloved dead, swayed forward with a flicker of light in her sombre eyes, like a ray of sunshine heralding a tempest of rain.

“He was that indeed,” she whispered softly, with quivering lips.  “You took a lot of notice of him, Tom.  I loved you for it.”

“It’s almost incredible the resemblance there was between you two,” pursued Ossipon, giving a voice to his abiding dread, and trying to conceal his nervous, sickening impatience for the train to start.  “Yes; he resembled you.”

These words were not especially touching or sympathetic.  But the fact of that resemblance insisted upon was enough in itself to act upon her emotions powerfully.  With a little faint cry, and throwing her arms out, Mrs Verloc burst into tears at last.

Ossipon entered the carriage, hastily closed the door and looked out to see the time by the station clock.  Eight minutes more.  For the first three of these Mrs Verloc wept violently and helplessly without pause or interruption.  Then she recovered somewhat, and sobbed gently in an abundant fall of tears.  She tried to talk to her saviour, to the man who was the messenger of life.

“Oh, Tom!  How could I fear to die after he was taken away from me so cruelly!  How could I!  How could I be such a coward!”

She lamented aloud her love of life, that life without grace or charm, and almost without decency, but of an exalted faithfulness of purpose, even unto murder.  And, as often happens in the lament of poor humanity, rich in suffering but indigent in words, the truth—the very cry of truth—was found in a worn and artificial shape picked up somewhere among the phrases of sham sentiment.

“How could I be so afraid of death!  Tom, I tried.  But I am afraid.  I tried to do away with myself.  And I couldn’t.  Am I hard?  I suppose the cup of horrors was not full enough for such as me.  Then when you came. . . . ”

She paused.  Then in a gust of confidence and gratitude, “I will live all my days for you, Tom!” she sobbed out.

“Go over into the other corner of the carriage, away from the platform,” said Ossipon solicitously.  She let her saviour settle her comfortably, and he watched the coming on of another crisis of weeping, still more violent than the first.  He watched the symptoms with a sort of medical air, as if counting seconds.  He heard the guard’s whistle at last.  An involuntary contraction of the upper lip bared his teeth with all the aspect of savage resolution as he felt the train beginning to move.  Mrs Verloc heard and felt nothing, and Ossipon, her saviour, stood still.  He felt the train roll quicker, rumbling heavily to the sound of the woman’s loud sobs, and then crossing the carriage in two long strides he opened the door deliberately, and leaped out.

He had leaped out at the very end of the platform; and such was his determination in sticking to his desperate plan that he managed by a sort of miracle, performed almost in the air, to slam to the door of the carriage.  Only then did he find himself rolling head over heels like a shot rabbit.  He was bruised, shaken, pale as death, and out of breath when he got up.  But he was calm, and perfectly able to meet the excited crowd of railway men who had gathered round him in a moment.  He explained, in gentle and convincing tones, that his wife had started at a moment’s notice for Brittany to her dying mother; that, of course, she was greatly up-set, and he considerably concerned at her state; that he was trying to cheer her up, and had absolutely failed to notice at first that the train was moving out.  To the general exclamation, “Why didn’t you go on to Southampton, then, sir?” he objected the inexperience of a young sister-in-law left alone in the house with three small children, and her alarm at his absence, the telegraph offices being closed.  He had acted on impulse.  “But I don’t think I’ll ever try that again,” he concluded; smiled all round; distributed some small change, and marched without a limp out of the station.

Outside, Comrade Ossipon, flush of safe banknotes as never before in his life, refused the offer of a cab.

“I can walk,” he said, with a little friendly laugh to the civil driver.

He could walk.  He walked.  He crossed the bridge.  Later on the towers of the Abbey saw in their massive immobility the yellow bush of his hair passing under the lamps.  The lights of Victoria saw him too, and Sloane Square, and the railings of the park.  And Comrade Ossipon once more found himself on a bridge.  The river, a sinister marvel of still shadows and flowing gleams mingling below in a black silence, arrested his attention.  He stood looking over the parapet for a long time.  The clock tower boomed a brazen blast above his drooping head.  He looked up at the dial. . . . Half-past twelve of a wild night in the Channel.

And again Comrade Ossipon walked.  His robust form was seen that night in distant parts of the enormous town slumbering monstrously on a carpet of mud under a veil of raw mist.  It was seen crossing the streets without life and sound, or diminishing in the interminable straight perspectives of shadowy houses bordering empty roadways lined by strings of gas lamps.  He walked through Squares, Places, Ovals, Commons, through monotonous streets with unknown names where the dust of humanity settles inert and hopeless out of the stream of life.  He walked.  And suddenly turning into a strip of a front garden with a mangy grass plot, he let himself into a small grimy house with a latch-key he took out of his pocket.

He threw himself down on his bed all dressed, and lay still for a whole quarter of an hour.  Then he sat up suddenly, drawing up his knees, and clasping his legs.  The first dawn found him open-eyed, in that same posture.  This man who could walk so long, so far, so aimlessly, without showing a sign of fatigue, could also remain sitting still for hours without stirring a limb or an eyelid.  But when the late sun sent its rays into the room he unclasped his hands, and fell back on the pillow.  His eyes stared at the ceiling.  And suddenly they closed.  Comrade Ossipon slept in the sunlight.Embed"

Yo

[Verse]
Take a ride on my train of thought, fundamentals what I bought
Penniless, I await the emptiness enlightened
Twenty-six years on Earth, my soul fighting
Habits that ain't happen, my body has took a liken
To my lifestyle, battling stress the size of Goliath
Slingshots plus hard rocks, these stones getting thrown
My temptations are amplified when I get alone
Tried to separate the action from the man
I wholeheartedly understand why I need to grow even though I'm grown
If I did you wrong, I vow to make it right
Judge me off appearance, it was said to me, I'm impolite
Eyes remain in freeze mode, I'm stuck in fight-or-flight
I'm deflecting my daily problems within my daily life
Recognize hidden patterns of my own demise
Why I feel like hiding a truth is finding a lie?
Dealt with thoughts of suicide, women I've objectified
Couldn't see it through my eyes so for that, I apologize
I'm desensitized, working hard to empathize
Strung out on love addiction and groupies when souls collide
I've been this way since the day I turned six
I've been touched before, way before I touched my—
Now I'm almighty pushing through the pain
The almighty cushion to the flame
The birds and burning bushes in my brain
I had to make an effort, double overtime to change
Had to journal my journey and mistakes I made on the way
Manipulation to get what I want
Getting very distant after I got what I need
Writing rap and wisdom, whiskey, women, wars and weed
Narrating all these conflicts, then top it off with greed
I keep walkin', I keep walkin', I keep walkin'
Me and my so-called best friends don't speak often
Blaming me for everything when they can't point fingers at they selves, so be grateful I offered the help
Being aware is my definition of melt
My eyes see imperfections within myself
Cracked images, bad luck, and broken mirrors
Funny how I see in permanent so clearer
I dedicate this to the ones I hurt
It's time to get my spirit right on earth
Before my sins become a evil curse
Conquer thirst, can't revert to who I was at first
I channel God through this verse
Accountability, I take responsibility
For all my actions, I packed them in these soliloquies
Just because we're not friends don't mean we're enemies
Thank you all for listening, sending y'all with good energy

Yo

[Verse: Denzel Curry]
Let me take you higher than herbalists climbin' tree tops
This is not rap, my nigga, this more like bebop
Class of Freddy Hubbard, these words are uttered like dairy cattle
Makin' sure the rain last forever, I'm slip-less in Seattle
Foot to gravel, I travel across the nation for ages
Even as I start to get older, this music is bathin'
Inside the fountain of youth, surroundin' the booth is water
My mind is flooded with these flows, so get the recorder
My mental state is, ""Whatever happens, happen""
I'm makin' it happen rappin'
If I was back in the '40s, I would've been gassin', scattin'
Different practice created a different habit for passion
I find it harder to make an action, yet—

[Chorus: Bridget Perez & Denzel Curry]
It's all in your mental (It's all in your mind, but I'ma feel fine once I'm meltin' your eyes, because—)

[Verso 1: Acru]
Te embiste el míster, nadie resiste mis takes
Enviaré blisters para hipsters y fakes
Viste en mis textos mixtapes
Te fuiste cuando entendiste en this days
Que no resisten, a la bocha la desvisten mis pies
Los veo atados a ese caro metal
Sujetados al teclado y no a su estado mental
Les va a atormentar el factor que traen
Bati y Ronaldo acabaron de entrar
Dos en tu cancha, tres de local
Freestaleos puros, mis rapeos crudos
Que escuchen esta mierda mientras les pateamo' el culo
Zigzagueo en el humo hasta que taggeo el muro
Ataco con verdades así te masacro el rumor
En mi circo el verso se retuerce en vivo
Cada vez que escribo activo mi sexto sentido
Rivales elimino solo con tomas de aikido
Underground lesson
Mi boca es una Desert Eagle

Una cuota de ego, pero el doble de huevo
Pa' reírnos de lo malo y que se nos vaya el miedo
Mostrando trucos nuevos (Oh), los educo en el juego (Yeah)

Yeah, they don't know me, they just hate the way I glisten
Clockin' major paper figures
Feel like it's me against the world
That's how this nation made a nigga
'Cause as gang grows weirder
Like a vet, I play the middle
I can't compete with them, nigga
I gotta save or shake the system
'Cause as lights get dimmer, associates start disappearin'
But little do they know they was only parts of bigger pictures
It's a monster in my mirror, it's a monster in my mirror
Them snakes from my past, they put a monster in my mirror
Fast money, good weed
Good pussy, good air
This the only thing you see
This monster wanna be fair
I'm sorta goin' off these meds
Hoes on my phone wanna be blessed
All I want is dome, I ain't tryna build no happy home
I don't wanna be stressed
There's some hoes that need to be wrecked
There's some hoes that need to be blessed
There's some flows that need to be swept
When I finish blowin' these checks
Had the whole hood on smash, pussy niggas on the beat slept
'Cause the city filled with niggas from outta town that wanna be next
So far now, we're gonna need checks
A hundred rounds, you know we keep that
Catch a pussy ass on that back block, and I doubt you're gonna squeeze back
Just know your place, I know some midgets that wanna be Shaq
And please be safe, 'cause I know killers that wanna be rappers

Wait, what am I becomin'? What have I forsaken?
What happened to waitin'? Sick and tired of hatin'
Sick and tired of huntin', sick and tired of runnin'
Fuck around, you're done in, morphin' into somethin'

(1st Verse: The Black Ace)
I'm on top of the world
The power's in my hands, my thoughts are like a pearl
Beauty made from sand, from nothing
I don't have a care, so free
I can just be me
These are the days that we'll miss
Take time, reminisce
Rewind, watching Clifford
CG by my side, that's a clipper
Tears fall down and I don't know why
I was all good
Riding bikes through my neighborhood

(Chorus: Both)
What can I say
It's just a mood
I'm swinging back
And forward too
I'm all alone
But I got my crew
What can I say?

(2nd Verse: Ace)
I've been too close to realizing my true self
Always saw Ace as a trophy with no shelf
But I'm not here to shine all the time
I'm just here to remind you of better times
When nothing else can do it for you
Ain't no miracle drug
Prescriptions of addiction, that's one helluva love
Transcriptions of predictions that I made with my gut
Conviction to my diction, I ain't changing it up
More than I want to (uh)
More than I want you (yeah)
I want this feeling that I can do what I want to, uh
With no apologies
I used to up and seize
I used to spill my thoughts with ease
Until society said it was too much
""Man, you need to shut up!""
And for a second, that's what I did
I felt the heat and let it steep, my brotha, that's called a lid
I popped the top off just to breathe, the steam is passing my lips
You smell this tea that I've been pouring, go ahead, take a sip
I ain't so nervous nowadays but still be awkward as shit
But some of y'all say ""not at all, I feel the real when you spit""
So if my path is just to pave another
Ima show the people what a Black Ace can do
When he's got something to prove

Enter the dragon, [?] let's make it hotter than Tucson
Futon, maybe you go when [?] eternal slumber
Tombstone, Piledrivеr, if i take you under
The wickеdness pay the highest dividends
On your head and empty clips

Moshin' to nostalgic rock, I'm Brock
Semi-automatic might blast like Team Rocket
Wait, and tell 'em I'm mixing that Slayer with that 2Pac
One golden bullet to kill all that pop

[Verse 1]
Delivery, I'm the bullet that killed Kennedy
Enemy, D.I.T.C., darkest symphony
Necro, around and let the TEC blow
Red beam to his noggin make it look like techno
I told you, I don't even wanna be the best
I'm the threat with Tourette's making John Doe
Ricky Rozay, Aquarius Killa The Keyser Soze
Making a family cry together like the O'Jays
Back in the old days, I'm the one that's chosen
Thug from the 90's, I'm cryogenically frozen
Avenger, but yet I be the Joker and the Riddler
With a mindset that's switched like Harvey Denture's dent
The Dark Knight, a Clark Kent
Martin Lawrence when he traveled back in time with suspense
Suspended, animation when my brain reacts
Don't belong in this world like I'm Samurai Jack
Click Clack on the Glock, seventeen get me
Then put the Ghostface so we can empty the cream
Cash rules everything around me surrounding
The ditch where they dug the darkness that's shrouding
Found me, Nemo, ego Kanyeezy
Bruh I'm from a city where they con easy
Where they quick to pull that trigger, never a squeegee
Then make it on the late night news, good evening

""Yeah, Mike, things are quite here now at Miami, Carol City High School, but earlier today was quite the scene when nearly the entire student body walked out of the school to protest Trayvon Martin's murderer. Signs in hand, chanting, ""Justice for Trayvon."" Now Trayvon actually went to school here at Carol City last year so some of these kids actually knew him personally, and they say his murderer should be behind bars

[Chorus]
Moshin' to nostalgic rock, I'm Brock
Semi-automatic might blast like Team Rocket
Wait, and tell 'em I'm mixing that Slayer with that 2Pac

Moshin' to nostalgic rock, I'm Brock
Semi-automatic might blast like Team Rocket
Wait, and tell 'em I'm mixing that Slayer with that 2Pac
One golden bullet to kill all that pop

[Verse 2]
I'm Acid, fornicating with crack
Cheated with the virus that took over the life of Magic
Sharing a needle, with the common-slash-hobo
Sterilize with the spit that shoots from a Komodo
Dragon, gun chuck, fire, I'm blasting
Dope and sick , that is just a classic
Huh, that's a hit for you
That's the shit for you
I'm lugubrious because I'm from a place where
Shoot at and never on no Buddha, that knock-knock
And who is it? Am I really losing it? Maybe
Trapped in a white room with a dead baby
Am I going crazy? Is my name Casey?
Anthony, then the baby turns into an amputee
God I'm really losing my mind
Or should I end it all just by grabbing a nine?
But, it's too easy, Demonz of my mind leave me leave me
Put me into isolation so you wouldn't see me
Free me from misery and un-easy
Pain, emotions from the crypt I gain
Yet another young brain slain, mane...Dang!
He just lost consciousness
That's life when you live without consequence
Death over sixteen shots, his head is split
DeadEmbed"

**Wykonawcy: Maciek Farbacz x Denzel Curry**

**[Refren: Maciek Farbacz]**
Nie pytaj mnie, co tu robię, ja jestem napierdalacz
Wbijam na bit, jakby każdy wers to był zamach
Nie patrzę wstecz, dla mnie liczy się tylko dziś
Za sobą mam ogień, niech się wali cały świat i zniszcz!

**[Zwrotka 1: Maciek Farbacz]**
Ruszam jak czołg, kroki jak grzmot, bo mam tu plan
Każdy wers jak dynamit, wokół rozsypany piach
Nie widzisz? To dla mnie jest droga, ja muszę biec
Widzę metę na horyzoncie, a więc krzyczę: leć!

Kiedy wchodzę, to jak huragan, co zmienia miasto
Czuję, że mogę wszystko, niech się trzęsie każde miasto
Chciałeś zatrzymać mnie, lecz teraz wiesz, to niemożliwe
Bo ja pędzę po swoje, nie bojąc się żadnych krzywych!

**[Rеfren: Maciek Farbacz]**
Nie pytaj mniе, co tu robię, ja jestem napierdalacz
Wbijam na bit, jakby każdy wers to był zamach
Nie patrzę wstecz, dla mnie liczy się tylko dziś
Za sobą mam ogień, niech się wali cały świat i zniszcz!

Wchodzę jak sztorm, przesuwam góry i miasta
Słowa to kule, a moja furia to masa
Z Miami do Polski, lecę jak samolot
Tu jest nasza scena, ja ją przejmuję, robię to z mocą

Na ulicach wiatr, a w nim huk moich kroków
Kiedy jestem z Makiem, razem robimy tu szok, chłopaku
Chciałeś nas zatrzymać, teraz widzisz, że nie ma szans
Ja się nie cofnę, bo płonie każdy wers i wers!

**[Bridge: Maciek Farbacz & Denzel Curry]**
(Maciek) Ja biegnę po swoje, nie ma limitów, żadnych granic
(Denzel) Lecimy przez wszystko, ja i ty, bez żadnych granic
(Maciek) Każdy krok jest mocniejszy, jak echo w głębi nocy
(Denzel) Świat przed nami, niech płonie, niech nas nikt nie zatrzyma!

**[Refren: Maciek Farbacz x Denzel Curry]**
Nie pytaj mnie, co tu robię, ja jestem napierdalacz
Wbijam na bit, jakby każdy wers to był zamach
Nie patrzę wstecz, dla mnie liczy się tylko dziś
Za sobą mam ogień, niech się wali cały świat i zniszcz!

**[Outro: Maciek Farbacz & Denzel Curry]**
To moja ścieżka, moja droga, ja jestem król
Z Denzem na bit, jak kruki nad głowami tłum
Napierdalacz w każdym kroku, w każdym oddechu
Nie ma odwrotu – teraz już tylko bieg po wiecznośćEmbed"

Got my cousins, they still buzzin' on this music shit I'm livin'
I got family that rely on me with money in my bank
I got money the I spent and I ain't never get it back
From the one-four like A-D
You don't want beef though, shine like my teeth gold
Line up like free throw, your time up, like F.N
My weapon is lethal, she fucked me, I reload

I write this as my manifesto
I want the paper and the peso, same color pesto
I want my Nikes and I only like my Jordan's Retro
I push my lights to a new pedigree, but this ain't Petco
But life's a bitch
Take a look at who you ridin' with
Big buddy, you coulda been on Attack On Titan shit
But this ain't about my will
When it comes to facts, I never bite my lip
Or to bite my tongue, whatever, same diff
Blеssed with an insane gift
I told the hood, I startеd rappin', they started laughin'
From birth, my nickname was Happy, what the fuck happened?
My niggers died in different seasons, they can't recap 'em
I watch 'em try to USB me as I keep adaptin'

Over the whoever yellin' ''This is Sparta''

Since they let me up in the game, I just advanced it

Spend money on wack MC's, them boys brandless
Corny like a field in Kansas, on some bland shit
Game lock, get the combination
I spit out rap like a boxer, every combination gon' hit
See bein' famous is like havin' a curse and a gift
Or the endin' of Revenge of the Sith, I'm on fire
Boss Denzel is startin' an empire
From Garrett City all the way past the Vizcaya
I'm smokin' on this potent Enchilida to get higher
I'm rich, but I start to forget like Alzheimers

See the bills on me blue, so these faces are full crip

Black M,Painkiller (Mr. Carmack Remix),"3 ContributorsPainkiller (Mr. Carmack Remix) Lyrics[Intro: Ruel]
You're my painkiller
When my brain gets bitter
You keep me close
You keep me close

[Verse 1: Ruel]
I got front row seats for the parkside livin'
Feel like the one, but I'm one in a billion
Teenage cynical
And I don't really know
What's the point of livin' if my heart gets broken?
Drivin' on the road, waiting for head-on collision
Springtime funeral
I miss you, but I'd rather be alone
To keep me from

[Pre-Chorus: Ruel]
Heartbreaks, headaches
The doctor says I'm diagnosed with
Shit days, mistakes
But I'll be fine
But I'll be fine

[Chorus: Ruel]
'Cause you're my painkiller
When my brain gets bitter
You keep me close
When I've been miserable
And it takes forever
To let my brain get better
You keep me close
You keep me close
You might also like[Verse 2: Ruel]
Window seats as the plane starts leavin'
Miss those streets where my knees were bleedin'
Homesick veteran
I left my bed again
Oh, lookin' for

[Pre-Chorus: Ruel]
Heartbreaks, headaches
The doctor says I'm diagnosed with
Shit days, mistakes
But I'll be fine
But I'll be fine (Ooh-ooh)

[Chorus: Ruel]
'Cause you're my painkiller
When my brain gets bitter
You keep me close
When I've been miserable
And it takes forever
To let my brain get better
You keep me close
You keep me close

[Verse 3: Denzel Curry]
Okay, the pain kills with no hesitation
And my brain fills with no narration
Got the same shield that block all our hatred
Got the same chills when them thoughts are racin' about you
Talkin' flowers in various hues
Take a poem and make it the blues
If it's violence, then sirens are red
You won't talk 'til I'm under the bed
Pretty nasty girl, forget what I said
I'm kidding, baby, I'm just out of my head
I've been thinkin' out Pandora's Box
Take your box and you keepin' the lock
And I'll keep it locked down for you
And I'm bound to you, how that sound to you?
Then spread like the flu
And that thought get around to you
[Chorus: Ruel]
'Cause you're my painkiller
When my brain gets bitter
You keep me close
When I've been miserable
And it takes forever
To let my brain get better
You keep me close, ooh-woah
You keep me close

[Outro: Ruel]
I know you hear me (Close)
Yeah (Close)

Black M,Pale Fire,"11 ContributorsPale Fire Lyrics[Verse 1: Denzel Curry]
I feel like Huey's last words before he died
You can kill a rebel but the revolution survives
Every real nigga in history, always crucified
Quote wrong rhymes then read the lines and feed 'em to feeble minds
Food for die, my dialect you digest that's on the daily
Roses are red, violets are blue, brothers pushing up daisies
They say justice is blind, let me ask this, if that was a fact, then
She would be livin' in blackness, that resembles my black skin
X'd out Malcolm Little then left him left Detroit Red
Marked in a mausoleum for leadin' the mislead
This for the crackers that thinkin' they are Judge Dredd
That turn a prophecy when I come and I cut your head

[Chorus: Elohim]
In the pale fire, we hide out
Lay back and get down
(Hands up, don't shoot, hands up, don't shoot
Hands up, don't shoot, hands up, don't shoot)
In the pale fire, we hide out
Lay back and get down

[Verse 2: Darnell Williams]
Straight up, fuck the police, stay off a nigga dick, bitch
They shootin' without reason, or huntin', it's nigga season
He moanin', he couldn't breathe and they did him just like Rahim
After Tray got shot by the [?]
I taste blood while sippin' my tea
Put a couple chains on my neck because honestly I'm not free
What the fuck do you want from me? Steady killin' off all the kings
Tired of turnin' the other cheek and still gettin' our asses beat
That's that bullshit, please don't believe that Obama can do a thing
Except give us another speech about how we should keep the peace, nigga
I'm through with the protest, need a bulletproof vest
Underneath my crew neck, with two TECs, I won't be who's next
Motherfuck yo' cop badge, yo' soft ass a bitch and a half
That's word to Boosie and any hood that's bein' harassed, blast
You might also like[Chorus: Elohim]
In the pale fire, we hide out
Lay back and get down
(Hands up, don't shoot, hands up, don't shoot
Hands up, don't shoot, hands up, don't shoot)
In the pale fire, we hide out
Lay back and get down

[Verse 3: Darnell Williams]
Get chest pains everytime I see the news, type of blues
Leave a nigga leave a nigga stressed before he lacin' shoes
I'm lookin' at channel 2, brothers dyin' on some crazy shit
Tears flood the street from the mothers 'cause they baby hit
Ask us, ""Is we scared?"" Hell yeah man, a lil' bit
'Cause all this pigment made us targets since some little kids
Fuck the politics, Jesse Jackson can go suck a dick
It's evident that nigga care only in front of CNN
We livin' it, life at the bottom of the pyramid
Foolishness, it's crazy 'cause our ancestors built this shit
Royal blood in me, not a thug, I'm a fuckin' prince
Raised in the ghetto, lost my history on the slavery ship

[Chorus: Elohim]
In the pale fire, we hide out
Lay back and get down
(Hands up, don't shoot, hands up, don't shoot
Hands up, don't shoot, hands up, don't shoot)
In the pale fire, we hide out
Lay back and get down
(Hands up, don't shoot, hands up, don't shoot
Hands up, don't shoot, hands up)Embed"

Smokin' that reefer, makin' me happy
Told the bitch gimme the happy

Right in the bed
Gimme the head
Then I'll go-go
And make her legs spread
Split the sea, Moses
Denzel lay ya down, roses
But I'm not in a casket
I put the pussy in a basket
Then I bag it, then I pass it back
To my nigga Slikk
That girl comin' in here
And she want this Curry dick
Yes, she know what it is
And she know I'm a boss
So she got the Curry chicken with some extra Curry sauce
That's Denzel Curry Aquarius Killa
That nigga I will do that
Pass it back to my niggas in the fuckin' cap
And I'm finna go
Rip the cat, rip the twat
Right in her spot
Let me go and get it
And you know I'm gonna make it hot
Make it hot, like Satan, Lucifer, I did that
Denzel Curry, I'm takin' that bitch and I'm finna go get it, I get back
Then I pass it back to my mothafuckin' niggas
Then when I squeeze, pull my bitch like a trigger

A phantom
A spirit
A ghost
For ten years, the secret of Paragorge cemetery has remained
A mystery

[Verse: Denzel Curry]
One for the money and uh, two for the show
A couple of years ago my niggas were bumping to be low
Or too low key
Devil shit, get up on my level bitch
Say you 0500 but Im fucking over Triple 6
Crucifex, clan, aquarius killer at apprehending
Is with a tech nine, four five at my waist line
Ever since they took ? from my muthafuckin existence
It's been fuck a cop, fuck arrests and fuck a resistance
All black, rest in piss, kill these niggas like brotha lynch the
Porous or the dangerous, noose, rope, hang with it
Like, niggas please, niggas pleed, niggas bleed
What happens after the trigger squeeze?
She's on her knees
She ain't a queen, but I'm a king, jack
? here and we in that all black
Four Five to the six nigga that's head crack

I-I-I was feelin' sad until I opened up my bank account
Couple years ago, I couldn′t fathom what I'm making now
Send a couple thousand for the feature then I'll lay it down
Fuck the 9 to 5, Spotify gon' send the same amount

Shawn Michaels how I'm flexin' on you crackas
I be cheesing like a mug 'cause my blunts be getting fatter
What's the matter?
Every time I level up, my opps be getting madder
Had to cut them off 'cause all they did was pitter-patter, mane
F-F-Fuck the chatter, mane
All these bitches see you doing good and then they start to gravitate
They should put me in the draft 'cause nowadays I be ballin'
If I want it then you best believe that 99 done bought it
I be posted out in Houston, bitch, you know what's in my pocket
Black mirror episode how these motherfuckers watching, mane
I'm a 1-of-1 take a look up at my handlebar
Another phonk song? Jesus Christ, I can't handle y'all
A copy of a copy of a copy of a bitch
Regurgitated shit, mane, I'm really tired of it
Fuck all the bitches who ain′t trust my vision
I remember being broke, now I rap for a living
How the fuck I turn my voice into a profitable business?
'Cause I'm that motherfucker, mane, I'm just living how I get it
I should've brought more weed to the studio
I wish my fucking brain worked but it don't 'cause I′m stupid, ho (Stupid, ho)
I′m just posted at the crib rolling stupid smoke
Hop up on that smite finna hit you with the cupid bow
Fuck the tower, mane, I'ma run in through the back
Earhartt pilot (Mm-mm), where you at?
We ain't never gonna smoke 'cause you roll that goofy pack
I ain′t working with you, bro, 'cause your music truly ass

Black M,Pig Feet LIVE,"1 ContributorPig Feet LIVE Lyrics[Intro: Denzel Curry]
Welcome to the day niggas took over

[Verse 1: Denzel Curry]
Helicopters over my balcony
If the police can't harass, they wanna smoke every ounce of me
Breath is alchemy, see how my life converted
They say that life's a female dog, well I'm perverted
Go to jail and get murdered
Murder was the case they gave us
Manipulate the system so the prison could slave us, ayy
Nothin' can save us
Foot Lockеr, liquor stores, undercovers bringin' hordеs
Ten years plus four, little kids die at war
Mama want me baptized, swimmin' in the blood shore
Shut down schools to open guns and drug stores
Seems like the floor gotta flourish
When I'm readin' my horoscope, the vision is horrid
But you be soarin', stay woke
Rather live rich than stay broke
I'm starin' though my rearview in my pitch-black locs
My notes disappear, reappear, shit is wicked here
Tragedy all over the screen like William Shakespeare plays
Disease, the grade, increase grenades
Disease, the AIDS, I seize today
Like Wade, I fade away
I pray today, 'cause life is crazy
JAY-Z, a school of hard knocks
They want us crucified with stones and hard rocks, come on!

Uh, yeah, look, uh, yeah
I got a different reality
The cops ain't the only one that's pointing they gats at me
The government puttin' all this pressure on back of me
My friends wanna kill me for success that I acheived
So I'm all by myself around everybody
Till somebody from the other side come catch a body
Yeah, somethin' gotta change
The prison industry is making everybody slaves
The people that own the prisons is also making a loss
The gross of the prison system is over 7 billion dollars
Uh, so I'm trapped by the pigs
Feet poored out the car, laid flat by the pigs feet

[Verse 3: Daylyt]
Uh, see all we are VR'd, sleep in a snooze
Peeking at deacons keepin' the rules
Creepin' in rooms
Sneakin' cheeks for the doom, cats kiddin' me
Little cats killed literally
How these cats talk bigotry?
Like an Avatar forest, the machine talk, Jarvis
Whatever they hand you, it'll be y'all risk
Your hand stuck in the cookie jar, hold on to the sweet shit, beef shit
Green jackets, the old cats, feel the heat cliff, eclipse
Blacks cover the white light, cats stuck in the twilight
Why, Lyt? See, the wise life stuck in hindsight
Sign bright, read, catch up, it's monumental, don't mind your men
Mind you, in my mind intertwined you, men sign you in
Don't get no autograph from Patrick
Just collapsed shit
But don't run from Cleopatra
Perhaps you sleep, your mattress weak
Stuck like a statue, is that you geeks?
We attack you, don't act too street
We gon' ask you-
Bring the cops out, bring the cop-out
You see the pigment
We depict, the indigenous people-
Hold on to life, we don't go for the house of reps
They done trapped us in the alphabet
Our alphas can't get out the net
'Net ballin', imaginary goal
Shot clock, what's your net worth?
Chris Webber? Mmm, deep webber? Mmm
Time out, mom's house, etymology, mortgage die route
Be lesbian, buddy, you better study
Puddy holes on this muddy road
Buddy cold
They gon' pay for takin' my brother
Nas say we need one mic and they shot the brown one
Y’all done forgot the brown one
The new white Mike
Rockin' a nightgown
It's ancient
They covered his passed with his kid blanket
Y'all sleep, y'all don't see how the image changed
Remember the times, nigga
I'm here to remind niggas we kingsEmbed"

I don't give a fuck, trust me it's nothing
What give you the idea that we are bluffing?
Steadily grind, better be for something
Tryna keep good times in my circumference
Do whatever they may like I said it's nothing
No time for lying, no time for bluffing
[?] they're coming
[?]
Underground, that's what we're running
Sortahuman I ain't even playin' around
Earphones on my head, can't hear a sound
Except for the lyrics in my head
Plus the beat and how the speakers pound
R.I.P this universe, fuck this town
Feeling like an animal trapped in a pound
No matter how long we gon' howl
Still not sure if anybody hears a sound

[Verse 2: Denzel Curry]
Bring out the mask
And the Glock
And get rid of you
Pop! Pop!
Til' you drop
I drop it off yo ass fool
Villainous, villainy, killing them lyrically

Killing the body, the nigga autopsy

Smoking these niggas like Gangsta Pat

Yo
It feels good not waking up to a random thought
Had more bitches on my blade than Lancelot
B-boy's stance in my Pumas and Stan socks
Since the same box bitches been giving sandbox
Y’all call them Lambos, I call them lamb chops, your man's hot
Been cold as ice with the pamphlet
These niggas never has stripes like Stan Smiths
What I write is high-priced like the vanquish, Aston
That's why you hardly see me in traffic kid
It’s Cape Town with my Africans, South Side with a couple Chiraqi kids, don't need Laxative, just infest the shit, uh
Hazardous, and I am not an activist for you activists
I mean advocate for you activists
I be on some ratchet shit
I might pass the mic, I might pass my bitch
Nah that was an accident, I didn't mean to say that
I love my lady, love you, Never pass her

Okay, Niggas kissing hoes in the mouth now, that's how we rockin'?
She got you spending your money before it's in your pockets
And now you mad, complaining, 'cause you ain't seen the profit
You need to stop it, really, you need some logic, look
A pure excuse for a Trap nigga
Ya ain’t never had your stomach touchin’ your back, did ya?
Ya ain't really getting it to bring this shit back with ya
They just wanna hit some hoes to say you that nigga, I peep the motive
Look, they don’t even need that shit to be decoded
Nigga I been out here working like I need promotions (Come on)
Smoking blunts to the face, 'cause I don't need commotion
I left that girl in the place, 'cause I need devotion
I need passion, I need expression, I need love
Tryna keep my connections, because I need plugs
And that’s a talk for the bosses, cause I don't need drugs
I need my niggas in office, get that shit G'd up
They tryna legalise marijuana, but free my niggas from prison for tryna feed they Momma?
They tryna put it on us, as if we the problem
But we couldn't sell the product, if they wasn't shoppin', Wow
The Black Market need black couches and black carpets
And when I die, bury me inside a black coffin
But don't come to my funeral if you that awkward
Keep it real with your people, I bet it lasts longer

Done with Hilfigers, still niggas got the Tommy on us
On the PJ, thinking 'bout them ho in my pyjama moments
My brother let her pop bands, we look like the Jonas'
They only posing for a post, them niggas not opponents
You had a hit that hit the dirt with a defining moment
Tell your ho to get of my cohones, My neck look like I hold a sack of trophy, uh
I met the money, ever since it's like I'm not as lonely, uh
I know them niggas on a business level, not as homies
I gotta say I'm doing decent for a black man, ay
These Nikes on me, but we pullin' up in black Vans, ay
And when I spit the shit too deep, I feel like Batman, ay
I gotta make it, I'd never had a back plan, ay

""That's Ezri right here, we got Stro the MC! Sway in the Morning, Shade 45, Stro the MC is back home!

It be like this
They like Stro's on doubt with the shit, don't come to the war, if Buddhists on skim row
I'm just a rap fiend, tryna make the track scream, now that you on my dick, like cops with black beans
Row your boat, rhyme schemes, getting mass streams, just a bad dream, I be filling up caffeine, Waking niggas up
Group things, split them up, rip 'em up, leave moisture like I spring the bus
Leather dream, love a Queen, with a bigger butt, kid think I'm widowed but I only tryna get a nut
If we cord them on a turf, we'll stick 'em up
Whole lotta name brands, y'all rich as fuck
And I'm starving, get your shit ate like my Saxon Ave apartment, back in '08
I got flavours to niggas from most states, uh
Y'all got flavours to niggas with no taste, uh
Remember the beginning, they slept the whole way
Now they got my name in they mouth, call Ye
With delay, very few, holy vibe is the god, but I raise hell son, like Carrie too
Run out, drop niggas and dumb out
Know my catalog ain't yay, but when it come outI
Support bruh, like a tittie for the city
Some think I'm stressed 'cause I don't act silly
But, slow your row, like your legs was broken
Who's joker, I'm king of the jokes, so why should I lope?
The Game corrupt, I'm like Daz
Really got dogs, man y'all don't know the half
I'm laidback, jack, y'all know the swag
Sometimes I feel too real for photographs
They like, ""Crack a pose"", this nigga make a cracker pose, with a bounce that demands his soul
I'ma be labeled a legend when the plans are foul
Hoes get out of the clothes, put hands to toes, the man, the rose
My homie told me I'ma be the greatest so I'm getting acclimated
To being the most hated, bitch I ain't jaded
I'm like Michael but the vitiligo couldn't fade it
Move, fuck all ya rules, Stro's flagrant
Interrupt cells, stop ya homeostasis
Body rappers on a day to day basis

Y'all hear me good? am I good?
Look, As I excel
Smoke your favourite rapper, then I exhale
You couldn't get these bars on Excel 'cause, niggas Microsoft
I heard they ride waves, I'm Poseidon in the flesh, I hope you swim well
If that's your CD then you runnin' out
That's Ludacris, it's just word of mouth
Here, instrumentals getting slaughtered out
I see, Rihanna ain't pulling out
I'm back in my bag, My foot in yo' ass I told you, what beef?
I might go vegan, nigga's tofu
They got bars, what we got next, it's even
Prayers up, [?] how I broke you
Never stood a chance but you ain't gon' win this one, get it?
Never stood in chains but your ankle wear in this one?
Moving on, show my stripes so it's official
Maybe I should start rapping shit about a pistol like
Four or five, niggas in a whip, holding Nines, hope you got, nine lives because numbers don't lie, in the pump, got a kit like [?]
Better Foster your People before the feel get messy
That's too many bars for you to keep up
I've got too many scars for me to keep up, Draculas
Blood-suckers getting no love here, and closed mouths don't get fed, you better speak up
To all the lame niggas glorifying guns
Have you ever had a semi-automatic to your mental, while a nigga applying pressure for the fonds, at a drop of a dime, he could've dropped me like a punt, Don't muff these, bars that I'm spitting with a Brady on, Michael Brady on 'em for the bills and the checks
They been working nigga, check your chest
I've been working nigga, check my packs
Look, Starting 5 is really Like Top 5
[?], and bust rhymes
You wanna see how we get alive?
Then pull up at S.O.Bs to see them 5, how we get it done
On the downside, don't wanna hear shit out of, your mouth

[Verse 6 - Cantrell]
Mind to the skies I'm never going to fail
If I'm signed to Nas, I'm never going to hell
Eyes on the prize, It Ain't Hard to Tell, that by Halftime, I'm out by 30, your ship has sailed, I need
Big green man I'm God Son's two, I know the best of us do Yeshua, Holla Haezus
Niggas fucking anything these days with two shoes
Set they tail on a donkey they up in there too, but
See I ain't judging, y'all I ain't judging
We make waves and you play in puddles
My big dogs they ain't wearing muzzles
Red nose to the money talk you sounding awful, you see
I ain't with the violence, don't condone
Homies know that I be chilling in my zone
And niggas talk hard on the phone one day, know they 'bout as hard as, Dragonfly Jones, look
Phone call from a nigga that need millions, put it in perspective I ain't working hard enough
Red pill to blue pill, I'ma choose, harden up, word to Shawn, not a bluff, I'm diamond in the rough, time to run our numbers up
Cost them boy, let's grind 'em, where'd you find 'em? I was chilling in the south homie, working on the skill, fucking bitches, sipping little, not much but still, working on growth and such, rapping with a bible
Black skin my ensemble, new plan dropping like, Scarlet takes the tumble, we can't, hit you if you mumble better say it with your chest, time to lace 'em up and, tangle with the best, look
B-boy demeanour, boy that boy been getting meaner, rappers scared, I'm makin' movies homie tell me, have you seen 'em? Got the cheat sheet if need it, cements to the semen, Sway, and all I did was believing look
Ten toes everything, come back ten four, Free bubble from the creep that's how that shit go
I be the nigga that eat free look, Puma on my feet, click tight like Penrose, I'm out here searching for something
Drinking a little, Parties and fucking
Me answer phone calls but my friends all be ducking
Homies want their daughter, she ain't wanted for nothing
I see both sides like Chanel, I knew that I be that nigga when I was 12
I knew that I be that nigga when I was 12, look, Starting 5 beat down if you put us on the shelf, and you really know, how it really goes look, we got foes like, riding foe foe's down

[Verse 7 - Stro]
Stro the MC
If 'trell's gon' do that, I'ma have to keep going, and pursue that
When I say ""that"", you know I'm talking 'bout the mic, niggas thought they nicer than Stro, Ha, sike
Uh, Let's kick the shit that they like
Matter fact, love, grip mics like a glove
Niggas look lonely, you need a hug
Everybody in the game tryna be a thug
Shit is sad, came through like a dad
Son niggas, spit like a gun niggas
Run niggas, do this shit for fun niggas
And I'm broke, can't forget about the funds niggas
That's why you gotta come to the show, cop a little merch
We leave 'em in the dirt, you know we putting work, like we ain't got papers, Snap 'em we even got more flavour, What's the caper? I need the information, niggas so sick, like a doctor got patients
Matter fact I'm lying, 'cause I be in a rush, I be rushing (Russian) like Trump team, What the fuck?
Gotta keep on going, and keep flowing, Stro the MC you a snail, you keep slowing, Yah, Procrastinatin', I Roc the Nation, I'm the greatest
That's what I say in the mirror, gotta get the vision clearer, I know you hid her, Starting 5 on the microphone, Take your shit home
Nigga I'm a dog, where's the bone?
I do it on my own, Matter fact I'm lying, we got Mass Appeal, they be youngin' the deal, and now we gotta kill, now we on the tour, it's like, stay bleeding we keep it raw
I just ate steak overseas, that shit was good
My nigga Ez, Ohio that's his hood

[Verse 8 - Ezri]
Right, yeah
And they know
Shoutout to my nigga Stro
We are not the type to be starting shit
I just know niggas ain't as hard as these artists is
Besides the cart, these niggas softer than cartilage, they offer me to support it these labels giving out starting kits
We went to war for this, actually had to starve for this shit
We exhausted, we actually gave our hearts to this shit
The role-playing and sticking to every part of the script
These niggas acting but they ain't playing no part in this shit
Charge it to the game, I just swiped my card in this bitch
I'm calling shots before I'm calling it quits
I'm shooting shots before I'm calling the hits
They sending shots, they alcoholic and shit, creep out the dark with this shit
I saw the top and then I targeted it, I still got talents I ain't marketed yet, and businessmen that I ain't partnered with shit
Like Phil Knight, real shit, boy we all need a check
I just do it, niggas rather do that talkative shit
I'm done speaking and tryna explain things
To those that ain't been exposed to the same things
Same goals but we don't playing for the same team
We they A-Team, you the away team
My nigga got that stick, it ain't no slingshot
We pull out fire-fire-fire, took down three ops
Pull this piece out, then I bet these niggas peace out
I don't like violence though, I always take the peace route
My bro be selling peas, he's in G's [?], he used to sell them jeans
He's spending G's now
Why these niggas getting face tats for the street clout?
You did a boof, tell the truth, they tend to leave out
I feel like a king, I'm in LA, and [?] King, wow
Niggas hating, that's why we gotta stick in the beamer, uh
[?]
I need a Rollie, but in the school, G-Shock
What Phi got?
Let's see what my nigga Phi got!

[Fashawn]
""This is rap for the black people""

[Verse 9 - 070 Phi]
This is rap for the black people, Look
Blowing the wind like the signals of internet
Told them get it together I guess they didn't get it yet
All the comments that you leaving and the mentions
Looking for attentions when you could go get a check
Patriotic with these builds boy, just call me bill a [?]
Coaching 'em on approaching, this pressure with diligence, oh
Raised like Tom Brady, like fuck your Mom, pay me
They say they want you to shine, but trust is all Shady
Not even M&M's they eat, they want you looking Slim
Put so much weight in these bars, I'm really in the gym
Getting slim, tryna clear them [?] lord, I've given in
Shooting shots of freedom, tryna live Above the Rim, Like
Mellow hoodie to start the season
Was never okay to see people with all this grieving
Plus lil homie got the rock, he looking for a reason
My heart is beating, Day jobs get off the seating
But look, you see there's rules to this shit, younging
Just keep it cool, watch them dudes, you be with something
Could pop up and expose all, that's not tough, Black rough
That's why I'm up in Sway tryna climb up
My mind stuck on success, That's what I dwell on, rebellion, taking the leap of faith, knowing I'll enjoy what I fell on, but never fell off, I keep my word, mark it, with so much drive for me to park it
These niggas lost it, coulda had it
All of my bars cinematic, but still so real you could've grabbed it
But they had to pop a pattern when you stepped on the field
I made P on the beat, after that for my will, I need some property for commodity that's my philosophy, me and the game practice monogamy, ain't no knocking me down, keep it low 'cause them Cosby around, like Dimelo tryna knock me for pounds, steaming smoke on the rags, but this exotic, straight to the head, brain-storming on some ways to keep the family fed
That's what's all about, no doubt in sight, we gon' set it off right
I crash pens if I write, 'cause my words so weigh
I'm bound to blow like Kurt Cobain
Hoping it don't make me blow like Kurt Cobain
It's a, gift and a curse when you coming for fame
Know if I could get it, everything could be the same, fuck it I can hang
Gotta be better than this life we living, never been one to play the games 'cause I don't like the system
And, to all them hoes I never paid attention
When you get the cold shoulder don't tryna play the victim
I play the Hitman, killing my competition, they non-existent
No one's conflicted, I'm godly gifted, I'm just tryna beat the game so I'm on a mission
Niggas stuck on gross street, waiting on permission
My bad I fucked the flow, but I'ma fix it, and then I'm gonna pass it Fashawn, we on the Starting 5 picking up the cash and you know we gotta dash it

[Verse 10 - Fashawn]
Yo
Channel the flow
Channels ero, dark mythical tales of a digital scale
Visits to jail, from villains not willing to tell, rather sit on they bell
Rather sit in a cell
Lifestyle of the endangered, harboured with anger, swallowed by anguishing greed, do or die, ultimatum either take it or leave
Catch a body then it safe to believe, it's taking the breeze
This lifestyle ain't for the faint of heart, razor sharp
Harder than [?], No A-salaam Aleikum talk
Niggas is like bacon, let us achieve, while they stay on my feet
Congregations to haters they need to take in the knees [?]
[?], you will acknowledge the best
Never minding respect, yo
This ain't Checkers this is obviously Chess
My nigga

All ya'll niggas lookin' like balloons, my bullets they gone pop
Black Maybach, Black tints, Quavo feelin' like Barack
[Chorus: Quavo]
I was broke down on my knee
Took me a long time to get it
80 peas, straight gas
I done graduated from midgets
Skrrtt Skrrtt Skrrtt, pull up throwin' money out my ceiling
Young Rich Nigga, fuck it, yeah, different life I'm livin'
I was broke down on my knee
Took me a long time to get it
80 Ps, straight gas

Skrrtt Skrrtt Skrrtt, pull up, Throwin' money out my ceiling

Nigga, fuck it Yeah, this the life I'm livin'

[Verse 3: Takeoff]
I was broke down on my knees
Took me a long long time
Wouldn't nobody give me shit
I had to grind grind grind
Remember them days, I had to finesse for checks
And buss on you flats, I came at yo neck with the tec
My niggas is vicious, they hungry for benji
Pull up at the trap, I boarded my windows
Rich nigga fuck them, I'm a young rich nigga still
Standin' on stage, blowin' propane
Fuck a Styrofoam, I'ma drink it out the seal,
Run up on Takeoff, make a nigga takeoff
That was A1, I ain't talkin' bout steak sauce
Me and thug throwed, and we need two cups
If my cup ain't double, its gone be some trouble
Came a long way, had to get it out the muscle
Now all my cars are muscles
Young nigga gotta get a hustle
Gotta use a wordplay like Ruzzle
If you want that cake, but you ain't got that cake
Gotta get out there and make somethin' shake
Got the 45 put it to a nigga face, rich nigga eatin' steak on Hermes plates
NO! I ain't never goin' broke, Early in the morning on the stove
Wrist spinnin' like a hurricane
Ice chain came from Johnny Dang
Real heavy on my neck I need a cane
All white bitch cocaine
I'm whippin' that birdy, with none of that whitney
That Brittney come with a free chicken, I live it
[Chorus: Quavo]
I was broke down on my knee
Took me a long time to get it
80 Ps, straight gas
I done graduated from midgets
Skrrt Skrrt Skrrt, pull up throwin' money out my ceiling

When I met you had a thousand ones
Now you got a thousand hunnids, nah bitch let me tell you some
You know I love you but it's not your money
And it ain't your pussy, girl give it all to me
I mean your spirit-soul, bitch I can not let you go
You know you had me once, had me twice
I had to fuck like fifty thousand times
I knew it in my fucking mind, that i'd wife you up
I knew that in my fucking mind, we got a APC
You know these bitches hatin' me, cause I am not dating these
Broke ass bitches no having ass money ass
Joke ass bitches, I might choke that bitch
Cause she ain't had no money for a motherfucking P-I-M-P
Motherfucker bitch do you see I got a P and it's on a bitch

The motherfucking Posh Gang, yeah we in it bro

[Verse 2: Denzel Curry]
Tell your mama to pray for me
Niggas be dying in over these streets just for bravery
Nigga you know what that means, that's called mental slavery
Nigga I'm chasing thee after chase back I'm taking the
Paper and put it into a house and I'm livin' free
Or you pay the rent but how I can pay the rent
So I had to pay the bitch, I will put that bitch on a strip
Get all of my money bitch and bring it right back
I'm cruising to that Project Pat
But I'm in the Escalade that's my nigga Lofty
Wait, hold up, nigga let the AK raid
If a nigga try to take what's mine
Leave him sounding like mimes
My nigga came through like a fucking landmine
Explode, overload, Curry the killer the overdose
Ass gal what's that up that nose
And with the blow she blow

I'm chillin' with my dogs when a nigga ain't talkin' 'bout that Michael Vick
Y'all niggas talkin' 'bout some Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay
While my niggas poppin' Blizz and drinkin' Tanqueray
Corrupt, like Tha Dogg Pound I bring the trill sound
You can ask Yung Joc they way it's going down
You don't wanna see me when a nigga brain reacts
I'm like Boosie, got a mind of a maniac
Keep it trill fam, tell them hoes to wipe me down
Got the juice like Pac so you know I'm goin' 'round
Way I flow might make a nigga pass out
Lil nigga dough, aks anyone here
Or Jimmie Hendrix, you crackers on my hitlist
Put a gun in your mouth, I'm thinkin' I'm the dentist
Never thought that Curry was runnin' with fuckin' killers?
Aks Ricky and Rocky who the fuck is triller? That nigga

Black M,Pyro (Sango Leak),"11 ContributorsFinnegan’s Wake (Chap. 2.3) LyricsIt may not or maybe a no concern of the Guinnesses but.

That the fright of his light in tribalbalbutience hides aback in the doom of the balk of the deaf but that the height of bis life from a bride’s eye stammpunct is when a man that means a moun-tain barring his distance wades a lymph that plays the lazy win — ning she likes yet that pride that bogs the party begs the glory of a wake while the scheme is like your rumba round me garden, allatheses, with perhelps the prop of a prompt to them, was now or never in Etheria Deserta, as in Grander Suburbia, with Finn-fannfawners, ruric or cospolite, for much or moment indispute.

Whyfor had they, it is Hiberio–Miletians and Argloe–Noremen, donated him, birth of an otion that was breeder to sweatoslaves, as mysterbolder, forced in their waste, and as for Ibdullin what of Himana, that their tolvtubular high fidelity daildialler, as modern as tomorrow afternoon and in appearance up to the minute (hearing that anybody in that ruad duchy of Wollinstown schemed to halve the wrong type of date) equipped with supershielded um-brella antennas for distance getting and connected by the magnetic links of a Bellini–Tosti coupling system with a vitaltone speaker, capable of capturing skybuddies, harbour craft emittences, key clickings, vaticum cleaners, due to woman formed mobile or man made static and bawling the whowle hamshack and wobble down in an eliminium sounds pound so as to serve him up a mele-goturny marygoraumd, eclectrically filtered for allirish earths and ohmes. This harmonic condenser enginium (the Mole) they caused to be worked from a magazine battery (called the Mimmim Bimbim patent number 1132, Thorpetersen and Synds, Joms-borg, Selverbergen) which was tuned up by twintriodic singul — valvulous pipelines (lackslipping along as if their liffing deepunded on it) with a howdrocephalous enlargement, a gain control of circumcentric megacycles ranging from the antidulibnium onto the serostaatarean. They finally caused, or most leastways brung it about somehows(that)the pip of the lin(to)pinnatrate inthro an auricular forfickle (known as the Vakingfar sleeper, mono-fractured by Piaras UaRhuamhaighaudhlug, tympan founder Eustache Straight, Bauliaughacleeagh) a meatous conch culpable of cunduncing Naul and Santry and the forty routs of Corthy with the concertiums of the Brythyc Symmonds Guild, the Ropemakers Reunion, the Variagated Peddlars Barringoy Bni-brthirhd, the Askold Olegsonder Crowds of the O’Keef–Rosses ant Rhosso–Keevers of Zastwoking, the Ligue of Yahooth o.s.v. so as to lall the bygone dozed they arborised around, up his corpular fruent and down his reuctionary buckling, hummer, enville and cstorrap (the man of Iren, thore’s Curlymane for you!), lill the lubberendth of his otological life.

House of call is all their evenbreads though its cartomance hallucinate like an erection in the night the mummery of whose deed, a lur of Nur, immerges a mirage in a merror, for it is where by muzzinmessed for one watthour, bilaws below, till time jings pleas, that host of a bottlefilled, the bulkily hulkwight, hunter’s pink of face, an orel orioled, is in.on a bout to be unbulging an o’connell’s, the true one, all seethic, a luckybock, pledge of the stoup, whilom his canterberry bellseyes wink wickeding indtil the teller, oyne of an oustman in skull of skand. Yet is it, this ale of man, for him, our hubuljoynted, just a tug and a fistful as for Culsen, the Patagoreyan, chieftain of chokanchuckers and his moyety joyant, under the foamer dispensation when he pullupped the turfeycork by the greats of gobble out of Lougk Neagk. When, pressures be to our hoary frother, the pop gave his sullen bulletaction and, bilge, sled a movement of catharic emulsipotion down the sloppery slide of a slaunty to tilted lift-ye-landsmen. Allamin. Which in the ambit of its orbit heaved a sink her sailer alongside of a drink her drainer from the basses brothers, those two theygottheres.

It was long after once there was a lealand in the luffing ore it was less after lives thor a toyler in the tawn at all ohr it was note before he drew out the moddle of Kersse by jerkin his dressing but and or it was not before athwartships he buttonhaled the Norweeger’s capstan.
So he sought with the lobestir claw of his propencil the clue of the wickser in his ear. O, lord of the barrels, comer forth from Anow (I have not mislaid the key of Efas–Taem), O, Ana, bright lady, comer forth from Thenanow (I have not left temptation in the path of the sweeper of the threshold), O!

But first, strongbowth, they would deal death to a drinking. Link of a leadder, dubble in it, slake your thirdst thoughts awake with it. Our svalves are svalves aroon! We rescue thee, O Baass, from the damp earth and honour thee. O Connibell, with mouth burial! So was done, neat and trig. Up draught and whet them!

— Then sagd he to the ship’s husband. And in his translaten-tic norjankeltian. Hwere can a ketch or hook alive a suit and sowterkins? Soot! sayd the ship’s husband, knowing the language, here is tayleren. Ashe and Whitehead, closechop, successor to. Ahorror, he sayd, canting around to that beddest his friend, the tayler, for finixed coulpure, chunk pulley muchy chink topside numpa one sellafella, fake an capstan make and shoot! Manning to sayle of clothse for his lady her master whose to be precised of a peer of trouders under the pattern of a cassack. Let me prove, I pray thee, but this once, sazd Mengarments, saving the mouth-brand from his firepool. He spit in his faist (beggin): he tape the raw baste (paddin): he planked his pledge (as dib is a dab): and he tog his fringe sleeve (buthock lad, fur whale). Alloy for allay and this toolth for that soolth. Lick it and like it. A barter, a parter. And plenty good enough, neighbour Norreys, every bit and grain. And the ship’s husband brokecurst after him to hail the lugger. Stolp, tief, stolp, come bag to Moy Eireann! And the Norweeger’s capstan swaradeed, some blowfish out of schooling: All lykkehud! Below taiyor he ikan heavin sets. But they broken waters and they made whole waters at they surfered bark to the lots of his vauce. And aweigh he yankered on the Norgean run so that seven sailend sonnenrounders was he breastbare to the brina-bath, where bottoms out has fatthoms full, fram Franz Jos‚ Land til Cabo Thormendoso, evenstarde and risingsoon. Up the Rivor Tanneiry and down the Golfe Desombres. Farety days and fearty nights. Enjoy yourself, O maremen! And the tides made, veer and haul, and the times marred, rear and fall, and, holey bucket, dinned he raign!

— Hump! Hump! bassed the broaders-inlaugh with a quick piddysnip that wee halfbit a second.
— I will do that, sazd Kersse, mainingstaying the rigout for her wife’s lairdship. Nett sew? they hunched back at the earpicker.
But old sporty, as endth lord, in ryehouse reigner, he nought feared crimp or cramp of shore sharks, plotsome to getsome. It was whol niet godthaab of errol Loritz off his Cape of Good Howthe and his trippertrice loretta lady, a maomette to his monetone, with twy twy twinky her stone hairpins, only not, if not, a queen of Prancess their telling tabled who was for his seeming a casket through the heavenly, nay, heart of the sweet (had he hows would he keep her as niece as a fiddle!) but in the mealtub it was wohl yeas sputsbargain what, rarer of recent, an occasional conformity, he, with Muggleton Muckers, alwagers allalong most certainly allowed, as pilerinnager’s grace to peti-tionists of right, of the three blend cupstoomerries with their customed spirits, the Gill gob, the Burklley bump, the Wallisey wanderlook, having their ceilidhe gailydhe in his shaunty irish. Group drinkards maaks grope thinkards or how reads rotary, jewr of a chrestend, respecting the otherdogs churchees, so long plubs will be plebs but plabs by low frequency amplification may later agree to have another. For the people of the shed are the sure ads of all quorum. Lorimers and leathersellers, skinners and salters, pewterers and paperstainers, parishclerks, fletcherbowyers, girdlers, mercers, cordwainers and first, and not last, the weavers. Our library he is hoping to ye public.
Innholder, upholder.
— Sets on sayfohrt! Go to it, agitator! they bassabosuned over the flowre of their hoose. Godeown moseys and skeep thy beeble bee!

So help me boyg who keeps the book!
Whereofter, behest his suzerain law the Thing and the pilsener had the baar, Recknar Jarl, (they called him Roguenor, Irl call him) still passing the change-a-pennies, pengeypigses, a several sort of coyne in livery, pushed their whisper in his hairing, (seemed, a some shipshep’s sottovoxed stalement, a dearagadye, to hasvey anyone doing duty for duff point of dorkland compors) the same to the good ind ast velut discharge after which he had exemptied more than orphan for the ballast of his nurtural life. And threw a cast. A few pigses and hare you are and no chicking, tribune’s tribute, if you guess mimic miening. Meanly in his lewd-brogue take your tyon coppels token, with this good sixtric from-mine runbag of juwels. Nummers that is summus that is toptip that is bottombay that is Twomeys that is Digges that is Heres. In the frameshape of hard mettles. For we all would fain make glories. It is minely well mint.

And, since threestory sorratelling was much too many, they maddened and they morgued and they lungd and they jowld. Synopticked on the word. Till the Juke done it.
Down.

Like Jukoleon, the seagoer, when he bore down in his perry boat he had raised a slide and shipped his orders and seized his pullets and primed their plumages, the fionnling and dubhlet, the dun and the fire, and, sending them one by other to fare fore fom, he had behold the residuance of a delugion: the foggy doze still going strong, the old thalassocrats of invinsible empores, maskers of the waterworld, facing one way to another way and this way on that way, from severalled their fourdimmansions. Where the lighning leaps from the numbulous; where coold by cawld breide lieth langwid; the bounds whereinbourne our solied bodies all attomed attaim arrest: appoint, that’s all. But see what follows. Wringlings upon wronglings among incomputables about an uncomeoutable (an angel prophetethis? kingcorrier of beheasts? the calif in his halifskin? that eyriewinging one?) and the voids bubbily vode’s dodos across the which the boomomouths from their dupest dupes were in envery and anononously blowing great.

Not to wandly be woking around jerumsalemdo at small hours about the murketplots, smelling okey boney, this little figgy and arraky belloky this little pink into porker but, porkodirto, to let the gentlemen pedesta-rolies out of the Monabella culculpuration live his own left leave, cullebuone, by perperusual of the petpubblicities without inwoking his also’s between (sic) the arraky bone and (suc) the okey bellock. And not to not be always, hemmer and hummer, treeing unselves up with one exite but not to never be caving nicely, pre-cisely, quicely, rebustly, tendrolly, unremarkably, forsakenly, hal — tedly, reputedly, firstly, somewhatly, yesayenolly about the back excits. Never to weaken up in place of the broths. Never to vvol-lusslleepp in the pleece of the poots. And, allerthings, never to ate the sour deans if they weren’t having anysin on their consients. And, when in Zumschloss, to never, narks, cease till the finely ending was consummated by the completion of accomplishment.

And thus within the tavern’s secret booth The wisehight ones who sip the tested sooth Bestir them as the Just has bid to jab The punch of quaram on the mug of truth.

K.C. jowls, they’re sodden in the secret. K.C. jowls, they sure are wise. K.C. jowls, the justicestjobbers, for they’ll find another faller if their ruse won’t rise. Whooley the Whooper.

So we’ll leave it to Keyhoe, Danelly and Pykemhyme, the three muskrat- eers, at the end of this age that had it from Variants’ Katey Sherratt that had it from Variants’ Katey Sherratt’s man for the bonnefacies of Blashwhite and Blushred of the Aquasancta Liffey Patrol to wind up and to tells of all befells after that to Mocked Majesty in the Malincurred Mansion.

So you were saying, boys? Anyhow he what?

So anyhow, melumps and mumpos of the hoose uncommons, after that to wind up that longtobechronickled gettogether thanksbetogiving day at Glenfinnisk-en-la-Valle, the anniver-sary of his finst homy commulion, after that same barbecue bean — feast was all over poor old hospitable corn and eggfactor, King Roderick O’Conor, the paramount chief polemarch and last pre-electric king of Ireland, who was anything you say yourself be — tween fiftyodd and fiftyeven years of age at the time after the socalled last supper he greatly gave in his umbrageous house of the hundred bottles with the radio beamer tower and its hangars, chimbneys and equilines or, at least, he was’nt actually the then last king of all Ireland for the time being for the jolly good reason that he was still such as he was the eminent king of all Ireland himself after the last preeminent king of all Ireland, the whilom joky old top that went before him in the Taharan dy-nasty, King Arth Mockmorrow Koughenough of the leathered leggions, now of parts unknown, (God guard his generous comicsongbook soul!) that put a poached fowl in the poor man’s pot before he took to his pallyass with the weeping eczema for better and worse until he went under the grass quilt on us, never-theless, the year the sugar was scarce, and we to lather and shave and frizzle him, like a bald surging buoy and himself down to three cows that was meat and drink and dogs and washing to him, ’tis good cause we have to remember it, going through summersultryngs of snow and sleet witht the widow Nolan’s goats and the Brownes girls neats anyhow, wait till I tell you, what did he do, poor old Roderick O’Conor Rex, the aus-picious waterproof monarch of all Ireland, when he found him — self all alone by himself in his grand old handwedown pile after all of them had all gone off with themselves to their castles of mud, as best they cud, on footback, owing to the leak of the McCarthy’s mare, in extended order, a tree’s length from the longest way out, down the switchbackward slidder of the land-sown route of Hauburnea’s liveliest vinnage on the brain, the unimportant Parthalonians with the mouldy Firbolgs and the Tuatha de Danaan googs and the ramblers from Clane and all the rest of the notmuchers that he did not care the royal spit out of his ostensible mouth about, well, what do you think he did, sir, but, faix, he just went heeltapping through the winespilth and weevily popcorks that were kneedeep round his own right royal round rollicking toper’s table, with his old Roderick Ran-dom pullon hat at a Lanty Leary can't on him and Mike Brady’s shirt and Greene’s linnet collarbow and his Ghenter’s gaunts and his Macclefield’s swash and his readymade Reillys and his pan-prestuberian poncho, the body you’d pity him, the way the world is, poor he, the heart of Midleinster and the supereminent lord of them all, overwhelmed as he was with black ruin like a sponge out of water, allocutioning in bellcantos to his own oliverian society MacGuiney’s Dreans of Ergen Adams and thruming through all to himself with diversed tonguesed through his old tears and his ould plaised drawl. starkened by the most regal of

various different replenquished drinking utensils left there behind them on the premisses by that whole hogsheaded firkin family, the departed honourable homegoers and other sly- grogging

I'm the nigga came up cold
All the shit they must atone
Let my enemies yell at me, hobby for the young bro
It's a tragedy when someone black as me get gold
Time to slaughter, street fighter fist, that's Nintendo
Told my alma mater gotta send me money, Venmo
Put us on map, don't sleep, siesta, man blow
Jack won't be no nigga serenading with a banjo
Real reckless dude with a crew carry ammo
I predicted winning would be something so taboo
But now I'm monkeying around with my brothers, baboons
Atlanta in Hollywood, it's on schedule
Chef in the bank, been eatin', check my dental
Plenty sugar, suite life, kicked it in the penthouse
My sheets all green, they don't knit me a bando
And a nice sweater too, fit seen levels
Floating here shining, I need me a drum roll

[Chorus: Daye Jack]
I'm too raw, raw, raw, I'm a villain, I'm a don
Mask and a cape, somebody ring the alarm
Wild boy, boy, boy, can't tame me, nah
Started that flame, somebody ring the alarm
I'm too raw, raw, raw, I'm a villain, I'm a don
Mask and cape, somebody ring the alarm
Wild boy, boy, boy, can't tame me, nah
Started that flame, somebody ring the alarm

Been the one, ate all these niggas that wouldn't feed him
And he serving raw cuts like red veal
And only attending school to sell pills
His red scale only see him when his bread near
And he'll kill if you try to interfere, aye
Now plottin' on heists over twenty million
I'm scouting like the black Pat Gillick
From the land where they killing they landlords 'fore the rent due
And common issues lead to firearm misuse
Only lie to the judge and the federales
I'm only hoping I get this bond from the magistrate
My mama hoping I'll abandon my cancerous ways
I'm sick mama, this cancer's here to stay

Tried to box me in like a game of four square
Stripped me of my rights and leave me beat in a coma
Had me diggin' my own grave like I'm Shia LaBeouf

Say we anemic then they give us the pill with diseases
Then pledge allegiance to the almighty legion

All seeing eye, you can see what you never saw
Would say I'm real but I'll tell you that

Black M,Redemption,"2 ContributorsRedemption LyricsSomething about the way you look at me
It's like the sun, when he kisses the sea
Something about finally being real
The moments through heaven, how we steal?

Something about me and you
The sea without the sun, wouldn't know what to do
Something about the grey
I could tell you never had to pay

When it gets dark
The silence gets loud
Inside your heart
You can't figure it out

There's something about rеdemption
It brings love to a whole nеw dimension
There's something about abandon
Just a shadow of the past, how are we standing?
Something about the answer
It spreads through your blood like a cancer
Something about the rubble
So much hope, so much trouble

When it gets dark
Silence gets loud
Inside your heart
I can't figure it out
I can't figure it out
I can't figure it out
I can't figure it out

Black M,Respect the Vibe,"7 ContributorsRespect the Vibe Lyrics[Verse 1: Nell]
Up in this thang, ready to pop
Dropping combos, with the slang, ah
Catching one to the brain
Better start fucking with the game, caught
38 hot, nigga don't cross you
Run up on the stain, leave him as just remains
Physical brain, havin' his mental up in flames
Kicking it lit with the same
Homies, only real niggas know me
Pull a .44 for the hood
Memories got me feelin lonely
We riding bottle, OG
Cold, as all of my niggas roll
Up, we blow, bust, its so tough
Any nigga run up, we go nuts
Cause we live behind the pistol
Raised in miami, grew up to know them
Them aren't the faux
Cause when niggas die they let it go
Let it rip, never be hesitant, hold that
Where the dome at, give 'em the flow
Reincarnation these niggas is old
Started off patient, then niggas went broke
But im on the gank, and a threat, any nigga ain't
'bout to try me, 'cept if I three
Take it to the head, I'm muhammaed ali
I bob and I weave, and bleed, put the cream
I'm that supreme, living in beamers
Y'all need me, we never believed
We could achieve, what life has to bring
Now get on my even, count my blessings
I learned my lessons, partial to convict
And I guess that reflects who I'm is
On a mission, I go the distance
I'm flowin' like Chris Columbus
Make your bitch come get this one wish
No rake, jake, or we chase
Smokin to the ? race

Rest in peace to my dad
Still can't get past this gun on my dashboard
Do a hunnid and pray I don't crash
Sippin' the last of this V.S.O.P., fuck the police
Stressin', gotta get rid of this weapon
Nigga talk down on my life and my blessings
They contradicting me, learning my lessons
But I'm a genius, they can't redeem this
Militant nigga, solid gold trigger
I'm from [?], they don't want rest
Nigga we do not take kindly to threats
I'm breaking my neck, to get yo respect
Fuck your whole set
Know how we mob
I'm dropping the bomb like I was Saddam
The Storm and the calm I'm feeling atomic
Taking these chances, making advances
Plug, they out hеre making it flood
Fuck what you talk bout', I need a dub
M's, and I ain't talking bout molly
But that don't mean that they ain't at thе party
My niggas gnarly, fuck with you hardly
My old boy died ridin' the Harley

Tryna act like you play like that could get you whacked

None of my brothers ain't die in vain
Slain, when I go against the grain
Feeling mundane when there's not enough pain
To express all the lingering thoughts in my brain
Change like the karma chameleon
Massacre enemies in my pavilion
If my affiliates don't become diligent, then
I'm receiving a million years
Have no fears, replace my tears, I got my ears open
To hear my cries, within my eyes, you see no lies, frozen
Eradicate, navigate, hesitate
Any day, eliminate first forty-eight
Norman Bates with a mask and a north face
Kill a cop, on trial, fuck a court date
Stevie Wonder on sight
Niggas wanna talk the shit but won't fight
Nigga wanna bark and shit, but won't bite
Put a nigga whole soul on ice
I'm not tryna lose my life
Darkness tryna use my light
They said that the world's my right
I'm still tryna write rhymes right

[Sample : ???]

Comment Ian Gillan a-t-il pu chanter avec Richie Blackmore ?
Comment Ian Gillan a-t-il pu chanter sans Richie Blackmore ?
Comment Ian Gillan être engagé par Tony Iommi ?

Nous devrions tous être obligés au mitan de notre vie de dévoiler notre scène porno préférée, là on en apprendrait sur les autres

Je n'ai été intellectuellement performant que de 1980 à 1990, avant je dormais, depuis je ronronne

Je vais vraiment mieux depuis que j'ai admis que mes solistes favoris ont tous souffert du même mâle un peu femelle : le lead singer
Trop salope ontologique, un peu pédale sur scène, pour ses ardents et patients travailleurs du manche
Trop présent par rapport aux autres instruments
Trop grande gueule, trop fort à la bagarre
Gillan et Mogg, persécuteurs de guitar heroes

Et si je n'écrivais plus que sur les années 80 ?

Scoop littéraire : derrière le personnage de Marc Albi dans le roman de Patrick Besson, Lettre à un ami perdu, se cache le cinéaste Sylvain Madigan, qui réalisa en 1986 Sale Destin, plutôt pas mal film avec la succulente Pauline L. et le délicat Victor Lanoux

1979, à Wimbledon en finale, Borg affronte le ricain Roscoe Tanner
Gros service, annonciateur en moins sophistiqué et moins autodestructeur d'un autre de mes champions, Goran Ivanisevic
Tanner, que je ne connais - il a pourtant remporté l'Open d'Australie en tapant... Borg -, mène 2 sets à 1
Il est train de faire fondre le Suédois
Voir le numéro 1 mondial en position de perdre m'est si insupportable que j'éteins la télé, et sors rejouer cette finale avec mon voisin Damien, ses raquettes de plage noire et une vraie balle de tennis
On accroche une corde de part et d'autre de la rue
A la corde on accroche des sacs plastiques Carrefour en guise de filet
Au sol, à la craie, on trace les carrés de services et lignes de fond de cour
Je le défonce
Je cogne comme Tanner tout en imitant Borg grâce mes cheveux blonds, et à un lacet passé dedans pour figurer son bandeau
Vainqueur et donc soulagé, je rentre
Notre vieille télé met du temps à s'allumer
L'écran est encore noir que déjà j'entends le commentaire qui annonce une balle de match pour Borg
Un des plus beaux moments de ma vie

Retourner dans les années 80, et tout refaire à l'envers :
Apprendre à tourner sur la tête
A faire du skate à Trocadéro
Avoir un peu honte d'être Blanc, m'acheter tous les disques de rap français
Être pour l'OM contre l'Etoile rouge et pour le Brésil contre la France en 1998
Prendre en charge la rubrique consacrée aux indés dans l'Affiche
Ignorer l'existence de Sear et de Get Busy
Préférer, comme les meufs, l'érotisme et le sexe réel à la pornographie
Lire des romans français et américains
Avoir des copains écrivains, intermittents, journalistes, attachés de presse
Deux enfants de trois lits différents
Des pensions alimentaires en souffrance
Des parents super marrants avec qui je fumerai des joints
Des envie de vacances subites
Jamais le temps de rien
Quelques économies, quand même un peu
Un vieux projet de roman sur mon enfance si passionnante, un autre de web série

Right down the street from where lebron beat rondo

Ok im green latern floating it's superman poking
Hot howking lawn you can smell it in the open
Even on the ocean that aquamen seaweed
Burning on that saga got this niggas wanne be me

Divided we fall, united we stand (x8)

Up in a gravel where they judge you with a gavel
But this kill will never tatel
All this ratlles in my face I feel like adam
But I was born with a appel the black man a bad man
Chokers and poseres preformance is over
Employing this soldiers that's ready for war
It ain't over till the fat lady sing
And the gun go click pull out the four four
And put in the holster jumping the whip
And I'm gone like a stoner no it's not over
I'm dubbling bad with ratatatat coz you's a rat nigga

Sometimes when I'm sitting on my bed
Feeling so, so lonely wishing someone'd hold me
All I have is three little notes playing in my head
I tried to be everything to everybody
That didn't work, bubble bubble burst
Now all I have is three million melodies to kill the hurt

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'mma I'mma I'mma I'mma
Sing 'em all out
Sing 'em out just for myself
'Cause I don't even care what the world thinks 'bout how I sound

[Chorus]
'Cause when I open my mouth, my whole heart comes out
Every tear that I want to cry stays in
'Cause I'm singing 'til I'm winning, gonna sing all night
When I open my mouth, there's no place to hide
And everything that I've been feeling flows like a stream
I'm singing 'til I'm winnin', gonna sing for me

[Verse 2]
All eyes on the hunnies with the bodies that could
Rock it like a rockstar, make the crowd go wild
But what about the ones with the hearts
So big they bring the stars out?
My stage is the greatest in the world
At the bottom of my bedroom, not much headroom
But I can hear my three million melodies
Make the place go boom

And I’m sorry if I up the stick and have to click on you

Put him in his spot, nigga, run the bread
Before I nut up put a gun to your head

And I’m tired of living at my folks
My old girl need some help
And my girlfriend bout to have a jit
Plus I don’t want him growing up saying daddy never had shit
Daddy never had it, but based on analysis
I never seen challenges, I look at his Roley I know that he flashin' it
I wouldn't mind seeing blood just like I got off dialysis Lord of the dark and violent
Only know imperial niggas move in silence, look that old boy yeah you shining

Flexing flashy wrists is correlating with my golden teeth
Diamonds all around a neck and it came with a diamond ring

That’s why I carry the 9 on me that’s a three times three extendo, that’s a 10-4
Seen them niggas on the 191, but a nigga peep game on the 194
Woah, bending corners just to see if they followed us
Sweating bullets, heater under my cardigan
These type of niggas is known to be poppin' shit
Deep in my thoughts, know who the prophet is
Tryna to take my wealth, gotta protect my wifey and my jit
Gotta set an example if you thinkin' I'm a walking lick
Never believed in lawlessness, but I could be with the shits
When I’m nervous it's dangerous, if the police pull up, then I tell em I’m innocent
They tried to run down on us, swore that the clip I might empty it
Lords of the dark and violent, just ended up on the pavement, quiet
This is the reason why niggas divided, pray to the lord I don’t get indicted
Send me all the way to Rikers Island, dead on the ground now he’s a carcass
That’s our guy, that’s our target

Sono magro, mica grasso, se la tocco, non la mollo (La spacco)

I never been audited, give me your Audi
I'm giving you quality, cool 'cause I gotta be
No accolades but you better acknowledge me (Mm)
If you ever see a brother on the street (Mm)
If you ever heard a brother on a beat (Mm)
If you couldn't stand me, better take a seat (Mm)
Any beat I get is about to rest in peace

[Chorus: Denzel Curry]
Super drunk, pockets on Professor Klump
From the swamps, where they leave your body slump
I don't krump, I don't jerk, I don't dance, buddy
From a city built on coke and them Xans, buddy

[Verse 2: Denzel Curry]
Sleep, sand man, from a place where the women get a tan, man
Bad boy, but I never went to Jan Mann
And I'm not from the planet, buddy I crash land on your bitch ass
Chillin' with my rich ass, killin' as I switch task
Persona and pizzazz, bitch, I'm live
Slide with the homie, I ain't got no phantom
If you turn into a fuck boy, we ban 'em
If I really get too hot then fan 'em
If I get too rich then the Zoes might scam 'em
Shout out to my brother LUCY!, ugh
F-inatik on the beat, ugh
Everybody know Shane my day one
So I'm never gonna do him green, ugh
Anime, anybody wanna play? I go sensei
Got my dogs rollin' up Dende
Every other girl lookin' like they hentai
X him out, got a brother lookin' like Kembe
Flow is super duper, storm your house like a trooper, yeah
I'm still with your girl and she gon' blow me like a tuba, yeah

From the swamps, where they leave your body slump
I don't krump, I don't jerk, I don't dance, buddy

Black M,Take_it_Back_v2 (Instrumental),"1 ContributorThe 15 best albums of 2014 LyricsI could begin this piece with a melancholy look back at the terrible things related to music that happened in 2014, and then use a cliché comparison to all the brilliant music that’s been released, reflecting with “the year wasn’t that bad after all”, but I’m far from enthusiastic about that idea. I could also rant like I always do about end-of-year lists and how I especially chose to write this on the first day of the new year, because 2014 wasn’t done before all the big magazines and websites started publishing their top 10s. But maybe I could break the general rule of posts appearing on this blog and actually get to the point as soon as I start. This is going to be long, because I tried to make a top 10 and ended up with a top 15 and even more runner-ups just falling out. Yay!

Honorable mentions
These are albums that didn’t make the list, but still deserve a place in this post because they are great for some reason. The list is alphabetically by artist; there’s no ranking here.

Arsenal — Furu: A great, varied fifth album by the world music influenced producer duo, and their best so far. From the softer, guitar-driven “Sharp Teeth” to the memorable electronic “Black Mountain (Beautiful Love)”, Arsenal manage to keep you entertained.
BRNS — Patine: A great set of experimental, inventive Belgian indie rock tracks. Very good overall, especially the first half is quite strong. Not everything is at the same level, but they’ve managed to make it a very enjoyable effort.
Childcare ­ — Flush EP: A great set of punk-influenced indie rock songs, produced by To Kill A King’s Ben Jackson, but ultimately not an album, so not eligible for this list. It’s very promising though, I can’t wait for a proper debut album to come out.
Cloud Boat — Model of You: A very atmospheric but happier follow-up to last year’s debut. Well-crafted and variated.
Damon Albarn — Everyday Robots: The proper debut solo LP from the genius from Gorillaz and Blur. Very emotional and personal, but with some uplifting surprises. If you’re looking for action, you’ll be disappointed, but if you’re relaxing, this is perfect.
Ed Sheeran — ×: A more eclectic and variated album than the British singer-songwriter’s first studio album, and overall more enjoyable. Very realistic and raw lyrics from real life, but usually quite upbeat and even showing off some of his great rap skills.
Febueder — Lilac Lane EP: Brilliant experimental EP, but again too short to be an album and be on this list. It’s still brilliant though, in its style-blending gapless fashion.
Girls In Hawaii — Hello Strange: Awesome live rendition of stuff from their previous albums, everything is reworked with dedication to make the tracks sound great and they shine.
GoGo Penguin — v2.0: Mercury Prize-nominated neo-jazz album. Very original and inventive, but not extremely varied, although still very nice.
The Griswolds ­ — Be Impressive: Long-awaited debut album from the Australian indie pop band. Very catchy and earworm-filled, and everytime you’d think they’re just a one-trick pony they come up with something totally different.
Hozier — Hozier: Take Me to Church was amazing when it came out at the beginning of 2014, now radio has ruined it completely, but this album is Hozier at his best for the whole thing, not just the first track. From bluesrock to gospel, everything’s there.
Jungle — Jungle: A great debut for this British neo-soul collective, but it feels more like a collection of potential singles than a real album, except for the brilliant interlude “Smoking Pixels” then. Most of it is great though, I’d just wish for it to be more varied.
King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard — I’m In Your Mind Fuzz: Starting out with a locked-groove driven 12 and a half minute long jam spread over four tracks, this doesn’t really seem like an all that exciting album on paper, but it’s very variated and twisted and that makes it great.
Magic Man — Before the Waves: Synthrock at its best, although I think this would’ve been even better had they continued the indie rock-influenced sound of “Nova Scotia”, the only EP track not on the album, but still great overall.
Pink Floyd — The Endless River: A beautiful swansong to Richard Wright, Pink Floyd making ambient turns out extremely well and this is a high note to end their career.
Rag’n’Bone Man — Wolves EP: His incredible voice combined with the great style-blending collaborative music makes this EP a must-try.
SOHN — Tremors: Not on the list because I only really started listening to this one in January 2015 (this pick was added later on), but it definitely deserves a place in there. His amazing falsetto combined with the alternative R&B electronica is really great, the only real issue is that the overall theme is quite depressing through the whole album.
To Kill A King — Exit, Pursued by a Bear EP: This has got to be one of the best EPs I’ve ever heard, it feels more like a mini-album than an EP if you get what I mean. The placement of the tracks is perfect and this feels like a cohesive journey. Already a classic.
Tom Vek — Luck: When Tom Vek is good, he’s at his best, but sometimes his lyrics seem quite cliché and unoriginal (even though that is partially due to his extremely clear voice, but the very varied and original thoughts in “The Girl You Wouldn’t Leave for Any Other Girl” don’t really deserve an award). I think this album would’ve been better if some of the tracks were instrumental, but it’s still really good. “Broke” and “Sherman (Animals in the Jungle)” are amazing.

And now, time for the real thing!15
Kasabian — 48:13
Blending their classic swagger rock sound with electronic experimentation, this is the most innovative and memorable Kasabian record so far. Highlights include “Treat”, deluxe bonus track “Gelfling” and “Clouds”.14
Dan Croll — Sweet Disarray
The debut album from a singer-songwriter and musicology student, Sweet Disarray is full of beautiful guitar ballads, electronic experiments and innovative songwriting. You’ve heard “From Nowhere”, also check out “Can You Hear Me”, “Wanna Know”, “Sweet Disarray” and “Nobody Knows”.13
Cheatahs — Cheatahs
Shoegaze at its best. These guys have been around for quite a while now, but only released their debut this year and it’s awesome. You hear their experience. Check out “IV”, “Cut the Grass”, “Mission Creep” and “Loon Calls”.12
We Were Evergreen — Towards
Produced by Charlie Andrew, who is alt-J’s regular, Towards is a sophisticated debut album from French band We Were Evergreen. Highlights are “Cargo Cult”, “Belong”, the amazing jazzy “Eighteen” and “Daughters”.11
Thumpers — Galore
Most of this album is percussive, incredibly catchy indie pop, but although they have their signature elements, the songs are very variated, from sample-heavy (“Sound of Screams”) over epic (“Unkinder”) and emotional (“Now We Are Sixteen”) to euphoric (“Together Now”) and this is the perfect summer album, which is stupid to say at this point, but it’s soundtracked part of mine.10
Zammuto — Anchor
Formerly from the Books and supported by Gotye, Nick Zammuto’s band’s second album is not one to overlook at all. His percussion- and synth- driven experimental music is something to get used to, but once you do that, you’ll keep enjoying it. Highlights are “Great Equator”, “Hegemony”, “Don’t Be a Tool” and “Sinker”.9
Oscar and the Wolf — Entity
I remember seeing this band play at a local festival, when they had only released two EPs. I liked them, but the style was a little too dreamy for me to really love them. But I’ve been following the band, and as soon as Princes came out, I knew that they’d changed, but for the better. The electro-heavy indie pop sound of this debut is amazing and Max Colombie’s voice fits perfectly with it, which is hearable in highlights like “Strange Entity”, “Astriù”, “Undress”, “Nora” and “Killer You”. A great debut.8
Foster the People — Supermodel
Foster the People’s debut was good, but not amazing. The album didn’t sound very organic or cohesive and the dance influence was sometimes a bit too much for my liking. But Supermodel’s lead single “Coming of Age” proved everyone who thought of this band as just good at one thing completely wrong, and other tracks like “Tabloid Super Junkie”, “Pseudologia Fantastica” and “Nevermind” are as different as it can be. This is Foster the People at their highest level.7
Aphex Twin — Syro
Richard James is still the king of intelligent dance music after more than ten years of absence as Aphex Twin, his most popular alias, and that says something. Syro is his most accessible album to date, but it’s one of his best and the album takes you on a journey exclusive to James’ music. Highlights are the 2nd, 6th and last two tracks.6
Bombay Bicycle Club — So Long, See You Tomorrow
The journeys of lead singer Jack Steadman have had a clear influence on the new Bombay Bicycle album, but it’s probably their most innovative and eclectic record yet. The experimentation on banger “Carry Me” and the lighter ballad “Home By Now” shine, as well as the slow build of the closer title track. Mercury Prize-nominated, and a must-listen.5
The War on Drugs — Lost in the Dream
Somehow I only stumbled upon this after multiple sites named this the best album of 2014, but they have a reason to. It’s a gorgeously crafted album that somehow comes up with something new every few seconds, and it gets better with every single listen, with so much buried in the mix that you’ll hear something new everytime. Everything’s a highlight, this works best if listened to as a whole.4
Temples — Sun Structures
An amazing debut from this energetic British psychedelic rock band. There’s a great flow through it and the songs are all different, which makes for an exceptional listen. The guitars and synths take a place up there with the vocals, and the album is full of epic solos and instrumentals. “Sand Dance”, “Sun Structures”, “A Question Isn’t Answered”, “Move With the Season” and essential B-side “Ankh” are a must-listen.3
alt-J — This Is All Yours
An Awesome Wave won the Mercury Prize and alt-J were suddenly given quite a lot of attention, so compared to the long period in which An Awesome Wave was made, This Is All Yours was quite rushed, but it’s definitely as good. Maybe not better, but a worthy second album. If you ignore the existence of the big mistake “Left Hand Free”, this album is perfect. From the genius vocal experiment-driven “Intro” and the unexpectedly light and jazzy “Arrival In Nara” over the classic alt-J “Every Other Freckle” and inventive “Hunger of the Pine” to the beautiful “Bloodflood Pt. II”, alt-J never fail to make this enjoyable.2
Recorders — Above the Tide
To be honest, I wasn’t even looking forward to this album. I heard Beach on the radio, the track piqued my interest and I Shazamed it, only to be left with “no match” and I had to search for it myself. Luckily I found it on the channel’s website and I added Beach to my favourites, read somewhere that their album was due for the autumn, followed them on Spotify, and then completely forgot about it. When at school on the release day, I connected to the teachers’ WiFi network (muhahahahah) and got a notification that said that Above the Tide was released, so I downloaded the thing and went walking to get lunch with the record playing, and I was amazed by how good it was. Colorimetric’s bass line blew my mind completely, as did the overall feel in the album from start to finish. For a few weeks this was literally the only thing I listened to, until alt-J’s This Is All Yours came out, then it was both. The weird thing is that after overplaying the album like I do so often, I’m still not tired of it, unlike a few other albums that were great when they came out but lost their excitingness after I kept listening to them. And that is an achievement itself. Highlights include “Wolf Drums”, “Colorimetric”, “Alone In Reykjavik”, “Dive”, “85 MPH” and everything else.1
East India Youth — Total Strife Forever
When the Mercury Prize nominees were announced, this was one of the underdogs, as the press complained about how much small artists there were in the list. Damon Albarn and Bombay Bicycle Club were some of the only established artists in this and these small artists no one had heard of weren’t that exciting for everyone, looking for bigger names like Kasabian and Coldplay who were all not invited to the party. But is that necessarily a bad thing? No, it isn’t. Some of these could never have won, like GoGo Penguin’s aforementioned v2.0, which is a great album but not comparable to the others and for whom a Mercury Prize nomination is simply a boost for a talented artist, not really giving a chance to win. But out of the whole list of Mercury nominees, the description of this one caught my eye, and I’m quite thankful for that. William Doyle is extremely good at using loads of different styles but creating something using them that is exciting and different but still alike, and you’re not alienated when after the accessible pop of “Dripping Down” you’re presented with the acid techno track “Hinterland”, only to be taken away by the euphoric krautrock track “Heaven, How Long”, which then continues into the ambient “Total Strife Forever II”, you get the idea. This works best as a whole album, although “Heaven, How Long”, “Total Strife Forever I”, “Dripping Down”, “Song for a Granular Piano” and “Looking for Someone” stand out. Must-listen for this year, and no doubt my favourite album of 2014.
So, that wraps up my favourite albums list, what are yours? Are there any we both have or are your favourites completely different? Let me know if you want, and have a great 2015!1Embed"

Black M,The Cern,"1 ContributorRabbit Hole LyricsGoing deep down in the rabbit hole
The walls are all red ventricles
Your in my grasp my tentacles
Psychotropic chemicals
Evangelicals can lick my balls and testicles
Castling spells with pentacles
Prada bag protectables
Have no clue how you all do it
I fear one day Ima fucking lose it
Lost it lost it my sanity I just toss it
Tap water droplets fall out of the faucet
When I’m casting spells with pentacles
Designer fucking spectacles
Having another episode and that's just not acceptable
Wanted to all let you know that I hate your guts and die slow
Welcome to fucking show
As above it’s all below
Black magick spells the smell of frankincense and myrrh
Images and thoughts start to blur
The only thing that was left of her was her body as the soul starts to transfer
Casting spells with pentacles
Designer fucking spectacles
Having another episode and that's just not acceptable
Wanted to all let you know that I’m at a new record low
Brain on overload and it’s ready to explode
At home talking to myself like hello
The ceiling starts to crack and I hear a hi back
Taps on my window who the fuck did that
Shouting at the mirror and I start to yell back
Shout a little louder then lights cut to black black
Black magick spells the smell of frankincense and myrrh
Images and thoughts start to blur
The only thing that was left of her
When I’m casting spells with pentacles designer fucking spectacles
Having another episode and that’s just not acceptable
Wanted to all let you know that I’m at new record low
Brain on overload and it’s ready to explode
Deep down in the rabbit hole
Deep down in the rabbit hole
The walls are all red ventricles
Deep down in the rabbit hole
Deep down in the rabbit hole
Your in my grasp my tentacles
Satanic CERN festivals
The pain is unmeasurable
At home talking to myself like hello
The ceiling starts to crack and I hear a hi back
Knocks on my window who the fuck did that
Shouting at the mirror and I start to yell back
Shout a little louder and the lights cut
To black black

[Verse 1: Allan Kingdom]
It's a little confused, huh
When a nigga lose her and get a new one
I'm winning, I was feeling like a loser
Like Jimmy, Macintosh is a computer
I hope I'm just a regular dude
Martin Lawrence with a little Martin Luther
Fresh prince with a little more Kunta
Get bent with a nigga with a future
I try-y-y
To hi-i-ide

We mix 'em together, we sending
Hits out on the regular, crashing the nebula
If it returns it's a comet
It's catostrophic
Put it together, now we atomic
Spread through the air like bubonic
Juicin', abusin', the greatest influence
The only ruin that was made by the fusion
Initially it is an illest illusion
Conclusion that you will die in the confusion
Anonymous and unknown, grinding 'til the sun gone
Mama gettin' worried, shit she telling me to come home
I'm a road runner but I can't afford to run home
Whip like coyotes, we turn into John Doe

Black M,The Ills (Cold Blooded Soul Version),"8 ContributorsTranslationsEspañolThe Ills (Cold Blooded Soul Version) Lyrics[Intro]
This the beginning of the end
Listen

[Verse 1]
My mind is a playing field for mental arguments
My thoughts are sayin' my emotions is who started it
My personality always conflicts with other people
The good in me has never been conscious of seein' evil
I could be ferocious in my times of feelin' feeble
Sick of life's ills, it could be short for illegal
Common sense, a victim to sensory deprivation
The mediator met with it all is in meditation
Lord invited me to stay idly on his left side
So I can right my wrongs in these songs to live and lеt die
Channellin' Notorious, Makaveli and Lеft Eye
Son of Ra, speakin' on Horus to see who am I?
Topple leaders, runnin' with demons, cunnin' and thievin' always
Silhouette-surfin' and stretchin' through mental hallways
Demons on my mind, they know where to hide, really
Then nine minutes later, I'm met with the nine milli'
So nine times out of ten, I'm probably going to Hell
'Cause I'm the devil, which means I sold my soul to myself
Shelf all of my worst fears in the mason jar glasses
Next to all the dreams and things I ever imagined
Book of magic, psilocybin, man, is a talisman
Speak my name in vain, it will be met with some challenges
I devise a way to rise, time to strategize
The purest form of Zeltron made me alkaline
You might also like[Chorus]
I'm seein' illusions in the pockets of my brain
I use it, then find a way to illustrate my pain
Confusion, 'cause you don't understand a word I'm sayin'
Forgive me for all I done, 'cause I be barely prayin'

[Verse 2]
The kid inside me always seems to man up
The higher power is within myself, no need to pan up
Believe in U-L-T the way a child believes in Santa
Manipulate the masses and the media on camera
Black holes and white lights, white noise and black sun
Shadows and bright lights eclipse back in action
Surrounded by dismay, I display visions of a way
For Heaven on Earth and hell on Earth to fight for night and day
Apocalyptic hoes conflict against my optimistic hopes
The ropes around my neck are golden chains for me to choke
My locs reflect the locks and the flames that burn across
In my very nation, I walk with my peers, surrounded by chalk
Deities and darkness meetin' at my dinner table
Deeper than rap, my life is real, this is my mystic fable
Play the bad guy just to finish the race first
'Cause the last guy was nice, but he end up dying of thirst

[Chorus]
I'm seein' illusions in the pockets of my brain
I use it, then find a way to illustrate my pain
Confusion, 'cause you don't understand a word I'm sayin'
Forgive me for all I done, 'cause I be barely prayin'
I'm seein' illusions in the pockets of my brain
I use it, then find a way to illustrate my pain
Confusion, 'cause you don't understand a word I'm sayin'
Forgive me for all I done, 'cause I be barely prayin'

Fifty on my chest, I got like forty on my panty-line
If he said I did him dirty, sorry, but I needed mine
Ain't doin' crimes, he gon' do it for me 'cause I'm super fine
Aunt Jemine, cookin' bitches up, I'm eatin' every time
Get on your grind, you bitches couldn't see me if you all combined

Oh, that's your boo thang? She need a new mouth
I flex the gold fangs, that's just my root canal
Every time I get dressed, I gotta move my bowels (Shit on niggas)
No kizzy, ain't feelin' them niggas
My bulletproof vest is made out of chinchilla
Walk through the trenches, no need for the hitters
I flip a lil' milli', I copped me a villa
Diamonds is silly, more ice than Vanilla
Got on Ricky with Bottega Veneta
Walk in my section, you need an umbrella
Got this shit lit and we never gon' let up

My nigga called me last night 'round 9, he was ventin'
I said ""Don't let these feelings get between all these millions""
He said ""My nigga, I feel it""

My nigga called me last night 'round 9, he was ventin'
I said ""Don't let these feelings get between all these millions""
He said ""My nigga, I feel it""
He said ""That's why you the realest""

[Verse 1: Meechy Darko]
I ain't prayin' for no meal, I've learned to steal blessings
The flow switches, fuck a playbook, I go off instincts
Caskets for New Year's and bullets for Christmas
I forgot more shit than you ever learned
Despite concerns, I'm doin' a'ight
Leave her drippin' like when fire meets ice
I'm God body, more the diet-y type
My niggas know rock bottom like Dwayne Johnson
I wrote this doin' ninety on my way to Slauson
2020, I swear there's been so many coffins
Filled with guilt, barely do I reminisce, it give me chills
I promise y'all there is no metaphor for how I feel
Bottoms up, glasses fill, life is just a battlefield
Why would I follow Roman calendars? I'm African
2Pacalypse confidence, notoriously arrogant
Jamaican brung, I speak in native tongue and scalp a nigga

[Verse 2: Meechy Darko]
Bitches love my aura, then they hear my story
If I fuck they mind right, invite them to the orgy
I just call it how I see it, and my three eyes been open
Matchin' Range Rovers, Dolce Gabbana drippin'
South of France, can't understand
Why they call it a beach, there ain't no sand
You familiar with weight? We ship that, you sniff that
The truth sets you free, lies tie you down
Tour bus filled, we stacked, packed, and flied through towns
Black rock star, I scream loud and mosh through crowds
Head wrap like Badu style
Young nigga that could trade war stories with the vets
Fleezus Christ, I turn water to acid
So you know that I could work with this
The way they stitch him up, you would think Dapper Dan worked on him
Troubled kid, tried to set fire to my nursery
Gotta learn to live with regrets
Cherish the instant deeds, Detroit Red
Pain over my shoulder as I unload all my troubles on these instruments
The final statement, I'ma leave it there
[Chorus: Meechy Darko]
I can tell that you want my life, this just a regular
Thick bitch on my lap, her name Destiny
She love whips n' chains, they talkin' S&M

It got a couple bodies on it, man I love this thang
Man I love this thang

[Verse 3: Black Thought]
Yo, it's been a revolution brewin' for years, becomin' human
Not a face of the movement is calm, so when assumin'
I travel many a road to arrive, at one conclusion
God is not an illusion, I'm proof of the contribution
I'm father time, I'm unbothered by the sidelines
I redefine writin', I'm Stephen Sondheim
This is genuine lightnin' on a pinot noir vine
How I keep the beast frightened is by being more enlightened
My city trained a titan to tussle, I dance in it
Somewhere between World War III and the Pandemic
My pen so anthemic, my struggle, you can't limit
Present it with a decision, I chose to stand in it
That's on everything, to every city and every gang
We the very same, separate is something which we became
Copin' with the pain, devils be spitting some heavy game
Keep a steady aim into the future and let it bang

Bitch, I'm ultimate
When I flow, I drop bombs like a Soviet
Not a communist, but I'm anonymous
Zero tolerance if niggas talking shit
Now you talking, the end of the partnership
Had to cut that bitch off
Send that bitch off with a fucking sawed-off
Being too nice isn't giving a fuck
'Cause these internet niggas be thinking I'm soft
What are you, lost? Come down the one way
I don't fuck with none of you niggas the long way
Stepping to the Ultimate is the wrong way
I'm a real ass nigga, y'all boys is anime

You don't want war in this game, ain't no challenger, boy
Rather get paper and stack it, my boy
With a bad bitch in a Challenger, boy

I'm gettin' hoes wet like a fountain
Mountain, get on the top of the Everest coolin' with penguin
Curry the killa, was born to be trilla than niggas they say I'm a genius
Einstein Aquarius'Killa, the niggas I'm not in the right mind
Give me a watch and a clock and a Glock and I'm tellin' you that it's the right time
TEC-9, MAC-10, them niggas they come and they bust 8
16 bustin 16, niggas is dead weight
Hey, just like the Titanic you know that it's goin' down
Mixtape rappers won't survive in the underground
You runnin' with me, I'm runnin' with God
Assassinate rap, you know mines a job
My nigga done trippin', on fours I be tippin'
I keepin' the whippin' like sonic boom
So when I strike back that jay shit is 'bout to blow
Nah this ain't no Scarecrow, like Pillsbury I wants dough
I wants more, yes nigga, I wants more
Denzel Curry, Raider Klan y'all niggas should know
I am that nigga with the phonk
Niggas talkin' shit, I'ma slide with that pump nigga
I am that nigga with the phonk nigga
I am that nigga, I am that nigga
I am that—

Black M,This Changes Everything,"8 ContributorsThis Changes Everything Lyrics[Intro: Buddy]
This changes everything, this changes everything
This changes everything
This changes everything, changes everything
This changes everything, this changes everything
This changes everything, this changes everything

[Verse 1: Buddy]
This changes everything
I met a woman, she loved me but got a wedding ring
She said her nigga don't know anything
Oh, that changes everything, we on to better things
I met a singer, she always snorting the Medellin
I don't approve but she sucking my dick incredibly
That changes everything, that changes everything
That changes everything, that changes everything
I remember in church they said, ""Boy, you better sing""
And now I travel the world up, places I've never seen
This changes everything, this changes everything
This changes everything, this changes everything
I got some homies in Compton who still gang bang
They always robbin' and sellin' that methamphetamine
That don't change anything, that don't change anything
That don't change anything, that don't change anything
I got the melody
That's why your aunties and uncles always be playing me
And I ain't moving a muscle until they paying me
That changes everything, that changes everything
This changes everything, this changes everything
You might also like[Verse 2: Denzel Curry & Robert Glasper]
Ayo, Denzel, where you at?
This changes everything, divorce to wedding ring
From sober to 'phetamines, from hungry to feta cheese
You give up anything, that changes everything
Bikes for Eversten, treat it like whatever thing
It's a now or never thing, regarding living life, besides
We in a circle from what ""Lion King"" writes
The cycle built, destroy, erase, and revise you
Cut the dreads for my rebirth, follow the primal
Instinct that I in-sync with no iTunes
So blessed to have everything praying to high noon
It's a great day for the beach, until the typhoon hits
Likely you could lose your shit
See change is the coin for the term called season
Mama said people don't change for no reason
Used to be illiterate now I'm the one reading
Used to be a follower now I'm the one leading

[Break: Buddy]
This changes everything, this changes everything
This changes everything, yeah, okay

[Verse 1: Sxsdale]

Black god, I'm a black god
Jesus Christ, Buddha monk, Allahu Akbar
Bow ya head, do whatever, you should pray for em
God body, black seven and a five star. Holy war
Sxsdale, yeah you know the business
Mea culpa to my A1 niggas my day one niggas
Never call them niggas woes
Nah boy, we don’t play that nigga

City streets, bloody water where my brother getting caught up
He’s a martyr in a kingdom where the son can’t shine
He a dealer, he a killer, hands up, cross-hair
He a Kunta, they like “kill em all on sight”
But my Martin in the valley, baby (woo!)
Feeling more like Malcom, baby
I’m anti-non violent
This Black 9/11, that ain't goin' keep flying
No lyin' Bitch. Holy war

Black mob, it’s a black mob
(excerpt from Ferguson riot)
Tear gas after tears fell
Tear gas after tears fell
Hovy told me ain't no church in it
Gotta brick and a bottle
Watch me work with it
Give em hell, till they burn in it
Return fire till they burn in it. Holy war

Pick up the pace
My city on my back Like Atlas
Not a drop a sweat on my face
Open the gates
Shit Lord I ain't smoked since I died
Goddammit I'm tired of waitin'
The look on my face a result me chasin' paper
Shout to my brother he didn't make it
Never even got the Chance to meet him
That's because you took him back in the 80's

If you want my respect it ain't hard to get it
Where ya heart when ya lookin' right down the barrel
Niggas packin' I know they won't fuckin use it
Why u actin' this shit ain't no fuckin' movie
Got this yellow bitch she don't wanna smoke no doobies
So we roll up them blunts and She seal it perfect
Still in my 20's I'm just a youngin'
Shit I'm tryna do right I ain't selling nothing
Thanks to my mama I been knew these officers
Don't give a fuck about None of us
Never been the one stunt I'm too humble
I Sit back and smoke me a blunt or something
Smoke me another one pour up a cup of some purple
It's darker than outta space
My whole team enlightened so Let's stop the fightin'
You niggas gone open ya eyes today


A moment of silence
For the finest of citizens victim to frivolous violence
What you gon' fight for
Be quick nigga times up
Better get ya soul lined up
Can't breath because the cops right behind em'
Hands up and they still got shot at
When you gone nigga ain't no coming back
The love is where the drugs at

[Chorus: Chance Cotton]

You niggas better pray they don't become my prey
Today might be the day I find a better way
I Got down on my knees but I forgot to say

Black M,Track 01 (Instrumental),"2 ContributorsPass vs RemyD Lyrics[Round 1: RemyD]
I'ma start with telling King of the Dot he's not welcomed
Cause when it come to putting on for Oakland, he ain't helping
I been here since July, every place I stepped inside
I asked about Pass and he is not recognized
First off I got a question, why you even battle rap?
You travel a hundred miles 'round Alcatraz, you might, you might
Find two niggas that give a fuck about battle rap
Most of these Bay Area niggas Got their happy-ass Cali swag relax and back
Cause marijuana damn near legal
So they got a bag of grass of the best weed you've ever seen
Add to that the weather been in 70 degree average
And most of the bitches ass Spanish
So it's nothin to get you some little red bone hoe with an ass that's fat
You can't be mad at that
But you from one of them good neighborhoods
Where the convenience stores only sell organic snacks
Any savage act in your character not indigenous to your habitat
Save the raps like you some gangster cat, you ain't made for that
The place you say you bang and scrap, the place I vacation at
I take you through that real Oakland where weapon gripping is recommended
Niggas say ""hella"" and ""blood"" twice in every sentence
Fuck a Pass or Passwurdz, I'll pass you to the pastor
Then pasture's grass dirt in a flash, turning bad worse
You thought I was boxing to share how the jab work?
No, two arms body this square just like a plaid shirt
I put you somewhere they can't search
Think you a stand-up nigga?
I'll sit you down so fast it'll make your ass hurt
Fuck a Pass, the way I let you review my history
It's two Timberlands to the head, re-boot your memory
A shot to the nogging will rock your consciousness
As quick as a album  that's common senses
Back bad if your posture missing (posthumous)
How you want it? Lots of stitches or doctor visits?
So they could find you in a bay by a dock of fishes
Fuck if we in your pot is pissing or not you tripping and get you dropped
But witness he don't do shit cause dude sterilize (still realize) What's not for kidding?
See the entendre in it? Dude sterilized, dude still realized
I son him like a father but treat him worse than some foster children
You ain't got no kind of lyrics
You gon say some moderate hitting line and say papa
Cause you say ""potna"" in it
Fresh Coast, you rep wrong as crooked politicians
Lots of gimmicks but when it come to this community, you nonexistent
My kind is business so it make my grind crucial
I take the time to make the lines that they rewind on YouTube
So I hate to find these lazy writers makin' rhymes how you do
But since you the Pass/past I'm truly glad they don't make them like they used to
You might also like[Round 1: Pass]
RemyD, please forgive me G
But I gotta use this line that I said against uh
One of these other wack niggas
But this applies to you as well so I'll recycle that damn scripture
Bruh bruh, the only fucking reason any human being
Should be nicknamed after a brand of liquor
Is if you're a hood rat, turf derp bitch, or a goddamned stripper
Now Remy think he can come to the town and catch this win, right?
That's funny cause no you fucking not!
Now I know you buy off that humble rock
Cause I already killed a Belvedere, it's Remy's turn so that's a double shot
Now give me some space before we make everyone in this vicinity shake
My niggas clap, give them that Men in Black, it's memory finna erase
My memory and my energy great
So tell me why half the niggas in this wack-ass battle rap industry fake
No, tell me why half the niggas from St. Louis got feminine traits
Let him do some slick shit and try to dip
Y'all finna see Remy get chased
But I'm sick in the head
My only remedy is Hennessy straight
But it's 4/20, I dare this square to step in my session
I'ma approach him like... ""What's up, nigga?""
Know somebody here? Speak up nigga?
Oh, you want a smoke?
Oh cool fuck nigga, do I look like I give a fuck, nigga?
We in Oakland home, the ""I Got Five On It"" so what nigga?
You a fucking punk, nigga
We gon make you throw fifty on it to catch a contact
You can't even touch a fucking blunt, nigga
And I keep hash in my weed stash, but you keep trash
You know he 'bout to roll up some wheat grass
My folks already gave me cash saying ""Please keep the peace Pass.""
So you know he gon' call the police fast if you run up and beat his weak ass
Lush'll be yelling ""Free Pass!"" before I give you a free pass
Now, this battle already done pissed me off, but I'm about to push through
You wanna get funny, I show you how you should do it
You look like Kid CuDi, but without the G.O.O.D. Music
You got a weird-looking ass face, always got some bags on your eyes
And you got a long-ass face like you sad all the time
Now I said fuck that, it's nothing see this rap shit easy
But to my trapping niggas trapping easy
They'll clap you easy for acting greasy
Have his beanie leaning to the side of his head like Adebisi
Easy nigga round 1
[Round 2: RemyD]
This nigga said I look like Kid Cudi, I know he don't want nothing
Cause he look like a low budget Joe Budden
That rapping vulgar gon get you turned to a snack for vultures
That results in you planted lower than agriculture
I have the focus and composure of a captain soldier
Fit to wear you out if we take this outdoors, that Patagonia
That's just the jab I threw, I grab the toaster strapped from holster
You better have a chauffeur smash the gas on the fastest motor
Nonstop shots when I'm blasting fo' ya
You won't finish the fire until it's like you mixed with Hawaiian my nigga, half Samoan
Retire you, light you up, Sammy Sosa
Have you twisted up stretched out same time like you practice yoga
Pass, gas, bad aromas, nasty odors
That man trash like bags of broke stuff on an alley sofa
You ain't active at your home that much I know because I asked
I roamed the aves and the corners of International role plus I traveled the zones to San Alejandro
And drove back on a path to go to straight to San Jose
To a Santa Clara camp and supposed a question
Does Pass or Passwurdz have any fans near Oakland?
And I had no luck
Plex Rock actually get more love
Mad cats say that they know Lush
But Pass past don't so much as fam has my condolence
You don't put in work, you pudding, perfect for tapioca
Bitch made, my switchblade'll steal your heart, Casanova
The switchblade's still as sharp as a dagger so it can't get grosser
If I'm walkin around lookin for larynx donors
That's the throat, Pass you know what?
Lush gave me to test the culture
You a average flower who can't match up close to my status quota
Your type style is the Dwight Howard looking ""nehhh"" for California
Look at me and see the Wiz (whiz) kid without Amber Rose's carriage stroller
Cancel your plans and hopes to blow up after going at opponents
Of my class that have voted to bypass Pass
Or for folk who know him as Alex, be mad they haven't told ya
Outcome is you flat as posters
How come it's cause that I'm supposed to
If I got the hood watching me squeeze the life out you
It's like I'm half a Boa and a Cobra
But if RemyD destroy with the Leroy match and glow
What that is? Sho 'nuff
[Round 2: Pass]
I love when niggas say shit like, ""Pass is alright but he's overrated""
See them sort of things just lets me know I'm approaching greatness
If I wasn't kicking the coldest game and going ape shit wouldn't no one say shit
And you know them same folks that make them bogus statements is mostly vacant
Basic vultures craving a hold of place
And the place them hoes afraid to show they face in
No mistake so I came here with a new definition
So this should probably help
Cause when they say you're overrated
What they really mean is that you're rated over everybody else
And fuck all that shit, let me get on this nigga's helmet quick
So Lush, don't tell me shit like you know
He's tryna get his name out there
And a buzz for himself and shit
Then you should help him shit, shit, you're welcome, bitch!
You got nothin but wack-ass battles and all a sudden
Now, you wanna fuck around
You just another up and comer comin up so I can shut him down
You rep Innuendo, so that's a battle rap crew?
You know how weird and corny that shit sound?
Is that how I niggas get down?
You got folks from Canada, California, New York, uh Midwest
And you gon tell me all of your folks been down?
Bro that's not a gang, y'all some motherfucking pen pals
And every time you niggas battle somebody it's like, ""Yeah, I'm Innuendo, at your front door or I'm in your window""
But if you say that to another man, that's a gay innuendo
So fuck your Innuendo
You think that's the beginning but this is the end you in, though
I offend you and your kid what I wrote with this pen and pencil and hit your mental
It's not a game when the things is running up in your temple
You get beat, no instrumental
I'm 25 been top 4 since '01 ekay? I been official
Get it? 401K; Beneficial
See, we Mobb Deep, you a Quiet Storm
Fuck that, you white Catholic choir calm
So kick back like a firearm and get fired on
Your turf hop from the Midwest to the Big West
Now it's a Fresh Coast style that you riding on
It's why you're the fence, you can't decide which side you on
No, I said that's why it's Wire on defense
You can't decide which side you on
See this is all-around sickness, I'ma let the crowd witness
Young, proud, gifted, you a thumb down tripping
Your slogan is team business, bitch this town business!

[Round 3: RemyD]
Now in that first round, I outlined him I gave outlines that outline
How I'm 'bout mine and everything he shout, lies
Second round, I out-rhymed him
Style-wise I lyrically out-climbed him, how high?
Hm, cloud, sky, miles-wide
Third round, I can skate out fine
He way outshined but it wouldn't be RemyD If I ain't give y'all that breakdown time
So you just be the passenger, 'kay? I'll drive
This Taxi Confessions
And as we travel this direction, I'ma ask you some questions
Like, ""Pass, where ya headed?""
I don't mean the place on the map where you destined
I'm trying to see if your dumbass could locate where your actual head is
Cause as of latest like your brain been off track for a second
You was Passwurdz at first
Then you asked them adjust it to just call you Pass, word?
You went Malcolm and X'd it?
Well if past serves me correct and you in a battling session
As the nigga who no longer has 'wurdz' you don't have any weapons
Is your plan to beat me down by having me beat down a man that's just helpless?
Or do we call you Pass cause you pass on a matches selected?
You been in the ring since the '05 calendar edit
With only 12 battles captured on record, that is pathetic
Especially since Lush One is your family, brethren
You actually connected to the top promoter in the battling profession
But you slack, half-stepping, his story is how past isn't present Misguided, passed in deception, but let's put Pass in perspective
You from Oakland, the land of Black Panters protected
I expected you to captured that message, passed
On the essence
But after reflecting on your lack of progression
And the name that you requested
I have the impression Pass is your preference cause you passive-aggressive
Can't be respected, doesn't examine well
So he's not passing in testin (intestine) like bad indigestion
See that's where we're separate which I gotta see
This here ain't conscious versus comedy, it's a promise versus a probably
See, you the type of nigga that'll sit back and wait on that day to come
I saw my city ain't have a buzz so me and some niggas created one
Shoutout to Aye Verb, Holla, and III for the URL achievements they got
But I'm the only nigga from St. Louis on King of the Dot

[Round 3: Pass]
Remy said, ""Pass, you're like one of the only niggas that I respect in this shit.""
Well shit, I guess it's just cause I keep it solid don't do hella extra and shit
A young black intelligent specimen bringing back intellect when he spit
A professional with professional wit
Now who here you finna convince that you better than this?
Look down on the ground, check on your kicks
Nigga you done stepped in some shit
Now I don't know why you would consider this is a winning option
But you wanted to get it popping so fuck it, let's get it popping
Trust me, you can get demolished
While your friends and your bitches watching
You ain't famous but a pound in front of you will make your name a trending topic
You wanna build a buzz from the ground up, I cinderblock it
After your funds like Capital One, what's in your wallet?
I'm in the deep east, slapping old-school, Keek The Sneak
My niggas mobbing being punished, trigger finger itching to *chicka* bloc him!
I gotta watch him cause this cat's from the projects
Do what they got to do to stack up them profits
Well my niggas is actual prophets
You just a bitch talking with no facts to back up your logic
You act like you got it, but I can't tell if you actually got it
Don't tell me you trappin, quit yapping nigga, you trapped in a closet
Who on the fucking block would be shook of you?
Nigga look at you
This is what happens when faggot-ass Yung III is the nigga that you look up to?
Fuck your St. Louis, cardinal, I'll expose your whole cardinal
In the city you from you on the bottom of the heirarchy dawg
But if I knock the bottom piece out the structure, the whole St. Louis arch'll fall
This feels weird, it's supposed to be like I'm face to face with the enemy
But lately you been trying to recreate my energy
It's like you're tryna make it seem like you're the same as me
It's plain to see, you probably even say you're symmetry
So I take this remedy, break the entity down into different compounds
That's basic chemistry
Ain't no way you killing me
This hate you giving me is a waste of energy
Like the way you came from St. Louis
So a nigga from Oakland can put you back into a state of misery/Missouri
Ain't no pistols bursting I can be the bigger person
But if I'll pull that blade on him
Then it's really curtains
And butterflies on his stomach like he's feeling nervous
I know you moved out here so don't trip
I don't need to let that chrome click to make his dome split
I have some dirty niggas stomp you out in Air Force Ones
If you feeling homesickEmbed"

Black M,Track07 (Instrumental),"1 ContributorMMXIII Lyrics[Verse 1]
If rap was a game I'd be MVP
I'm serious JME
Boy better know i will make it to the top
As far as my lifestyle goes I've never sold rock
And packing gats was never a prospect unlike Frank White
So I write rhymes alike
I'm passionate about the words I write
Never deceive or repeat lies
London's finest the best and it's evident
Music, loud, blastin' no respect for the residents
Got to start collecting dead presidents for when i go to the east coast
Michigan
My words relieve pain, Vicodin
Listen to the bars, you'll be reciting them
The purpose of my words is to enlighten em
So many fine girls gon make me think bout wifen em
But I'm underage
Too many weak rappers get over played
Hear the same ish tomorrow that you heard today
London Hip Hop Movement, yeah we pave the way
For this new generation that you hear today
Never treat the track with courtesy
Make it or die trying is what i say
I'm the 21st century Jean-Michel Basquiat
You might also like[Verse 2]
They peek at me because I'm Picasso
So it's peak for you whenever i record
London boy like the one signed to T.I.P
No disrespect but i gotta be V.I.P
Cos you know i spit fire in the booth
But Mr.Charlie Sloth ain't heard the news
I abuse the track
Leaving instrumentals blue and black
Smoke more rappers than Fidel does cigars
All i do is bust moves and write bars
So now I rep the London Hip Hop Movement
Minds congruent
We spit shit you ain't used to
Nas and Biggie Smalls on my wall
I don't manipulate minds, it's the mic i controlEmbed"

Spitting that savage, cutting that magic, it's drastic that gotta make shit tragic
But I'm just coolin' with my niggas, chillin', room full of bad bitches
Selling trees so we get lit, the weed to me like a sixth sense
Cause I bang on the tracks and get hella respect
Fuck with me 'cause they see I'm intellect
But you niggas is losin' and I am up next
Any nigga don't like it get hit with the TEC
Fuck all you haters, I fuck with them Raiders
We chasin' the paper, alive and I'm blessed
Flexing my chest while your bitch on my dick
But I left her behind because this shit legit

Puffin' loud got a nigga goin' deaf
Pumpin' your guns, get a fuck nigga left (Fah)

Hold tight rubber grip if a fuck nigga slip (Yo)
Empty the clip then I start with the crew
These niggas is pussy, I fuck with a few

Bad bitch finna get me right
If he try, I slide

Don't need a gun to get respect up on the street
Under the sun, the bastard son
Will pop the Glock to feed himself and family
By any means, your enemies, my enemies
We wet them up like a canteen
The yellow tape surrounds the fate
Don't have a face, so now you late, open the gates

Great, eliminate like ElimiDate
Hey, young boy had to penetrate
Face, young boy done caught a case
Bang, now his mama livin' with the pain
Wait, doctor says he's gonna stay
Let him get the Senzu Bean so he regenerate
Now a nigga harder than the head of the state
Denzel Curry is the new candidate
Ultimate, alternate, you are the opposite
Stop this shit, chop your esophagus
Bitches be boppin' it, bow down and pop it in
Droppin' it in her esophagus
She get so nasty, in public she classy
Perhaps she is able to swallow it
Girl, I can make you a star
Then I put her ass on Apollo, bitch
Bitch, I am ultimate, behold my awesomeness
Narcissist, part time an arsonist
Rippin' through cartilage, I am the hardest, bitch
Wrap it up, put in sarcophagus

You would swear she was a cop, yo

I'z a man don't waste time on a thot so
Only thing I like doing is writing flows
From the night until the cock crows
Jot those

And give it to the people them

Let me on the scene with him

Seeing fans scream and thing
Music is my dream and thing

But you should've held your son down, like evening

I never give the devil the pleasure, to ever take a fella off of his level
Still, everything's right on schedule
I had my personal vendettas, but I solved em
Cause all that drama, could stop us from getting dollas
I take advice from one, and that's my mama
I made her a promise, my word is my honor
Cause sure enough, I'm a grown up
Just turned 21 there's money to get, and I'm trying to get me some
So get your ass out my path, 'fore you get mashed
Put a whole new career, in your new acts relapse
What we have, is organized grinding
In a mind of real niggas, our vision's a clear picture
I'm still with you, you ain't lost me I hope I ain't lost you
I just, had to get that out fool
And let niggas know, a lil' something about school
And struggle in this concrete, jungle I walk through

[Scooby]
I am dog, a grown man dog
You don't understand, the plan at hand dog
You see the potential, I mash to get cake
Hustle Presidential, like a Bad Azz Mix Tape
Say I live what I speak, so you best believe
I grind to what's left for me, is left in these streets
Listen up man, I mean with figgas
I don't know if it's just me, but all I see is green pictures
And I don't bother, with these in between niggas
Loyalty is my back bone, we the team nigga
G-R-I-T-B-O
Y-dolla sign, chump cause we need do'
Respect is power, and power is money
Money is time, money is the reason that I rhyme and grind
Might I remind you, that I'm designed to
Move anything out the way, of getting what's mine fool
You might also like[H.A.W.K.]
See the type of nigga I am, I give a good damn
Bout anything, other than fam
Just ten years ago, when I didn't have flow
Before You Already Know, when I didn't have do'
My mom's oldest seed, I had to take the lead
Dreams of making believe, became make believe
We was boys but we now men, ask once then you'll ask again
How many times, will I have to lend
You on the outside, looking in
You don't know where I done been, do anything to get in
I don't know how, some of you think
But soon as you blink, they here on the first and fifteenth
Now see I got bills too, feel me like you I feel you
God damn, I got a life too
Got a kid, and a wife too
And how the hell they gon eat, if I still gotta feed you

[Lil' Keke]
Follow the vision, and we can walk the road clear
I hustled and struggled, it was another long year
I never had a brother, so I turned to the thugs
No unconditional love, cause we ain't the same blood
Tough guys, most y'all niggas still bluffing
I'm thinking while I'm puffing, I don't owe you niggas nothing
I'm changing my ways, I'm living my life new
Nigga get your own thang, and see what your hustle do
I done heard it all nigga, guess I'm chasing a dream
Got a big family to feed, and I'm the coach of that team
If you the shit best believe, all the flies they love it
When the plan going bad, everybody say fuck it
And you recognize game, when the pain is felt
And it's one thang fa sho, I ain't gon lie to myself
So you busta ass niggas, can't see night from day
Understand black man, I got bills to pay

[Intro: Travis Scott]
Uh
Mmm

[Chorus: Travis Scott & A$AP Ferg]
I'm riding up uptown (Woo)
I'm a mothafuckin' monster (Woo)
One hand on the wheel, one hand on my dick
I'm a motherfucking monster (Woo)
You riding up uptown (Woo)
One hand on the wheel, one hand on my dick, uh (Woo, woo)

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
At the green light I'm speeding
Fourth wheel on, I'm weaving
I got red eyes and swag seizures
All my concerts filling them bleachers
Ooh girl with this camo on, they can't see us
Tossed in a little more dank
And a little more drank than La Flame might need
Tito Puente with the candy top
Fuck around, make the Latinas pop (Hmm)
It's a new world order (Hmm)
Never had my head on my shoulders, uh
Beware of the monsters
Ain't that what your prеacher told ya? (Uh)
La Flame, 500 degrees
From thе uptown to the Magnolia

I'm a mothafuckin' monster (Woo)
I'm a mothafuckin' monster (Woo)
Uh, I'm riding up uptown (Woah)
I'm a mothafuckin' monster (Woo)
One hand on the wheel, damn (Uh, uh)

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Damn you gorgeous, tell me something I don't know
Dice on the corner with the lights low
Got the base in my sock, fuck the 5-0
Damn you conscious
Gon' get your head off the plate though
Let me show you lil' Yamamoto
Take a little lick of the mayo
Out on 135th, spending them pesos
Tell my nigga Fergie Ferg keep the back locked
'Cause we got a little bit of Tango (Yeah)
Real nigga from the South to the East of Philly nigga
Bangin' wax since a nigga get a wait
Take a little taste, leave you numb feeling in the face
I'll pass if that pint ain't sealed, I'll make your weekend hell
XX know that we gon' die for this and probably keep it trill, mm
Chain links, by nigga, popular demand nigga
My bitch pearls from the clams, nigga
She can ride the dick no hands, mm
[Chorus: Travis Scott]
While I'm riding uptown (Woo, woo)
I'm a mothafuckin' monster (Woo, mm, woo)

[Verse 3: Denzel Curry]
Envious, everyone actin' so frivolous
Jealousy, I can read it with telepathy
You making me sick, you making me sick
I-I-I might run up on a nigga and—
Clique!
It is the ultimate Myrmidon
From the land, which is the city of Babylon
Dreads in my hairs, don’t confuse me for Cinnamon
I'm one of a kind, as I grow like a Digimon
When I'm evolving, not many books
Many revolvers, no problem solving
Illegal tendencies, infinite symphonies
Illustrate misery, living on infamy
Infamous Lord
If you come back from the dead, you will go back to the morgue
I'll hunt you like Sun Tzu, so better be humble
Don't make me, I'm Wesley in the Art of War
Soar, synonym, you will be flying
Truth, antonym, I won't be lying
Bruh, ain't no hakuna matata
'Cuz, you shouldn't fuck with a lion
Damn
I might run up on a nigga and—
I might run up on a nigga and—
I-I-I might run up on a nigga and—
I-I-I might run up on a nigga and—
[Chorus: Travis Scott]
I'm riding up uptown (Woo)
I'm a mothafuckin' monster (Woo)
One hand on the wheel, one hand on my dick
I'm a motherfucking monster (Woo)
You riding up uptown (Woo)
One hand on the wheel, one hand on my dick, uh (Woo, woo)

Black on black, cars in my yard
Hop the fence, sound on my alarm
Talkin bout a death league something bizzare
Get a phone call, say ""We know who you are.""
My girlfriend says, ""You got shot in the arm!""
Back in the back when I hop out the car
Better not charge me with the sawed off
Make a lot of bread all I need is 1 large
Shawty, and I need caps in the shotgun, birds in the roof
Someone blew up the new bentley coupe
Wonder why [?] troops
Shes bleeding, gotta make moves
Run up the stairs to my mansion
Death [?], Charles Manson
Guns AR man, they blastin
Killer snake, gotta stay, gotta stay ashin'

People try to trap me in a vortex

Since my birth and seconds on Earth, I been the first one to confront
All of these cycles that get recycled, makin' it stifle while I stunt
Roll me a blunt so I forget it
But it make the details look so vivid
Went through a lot of shit in the last year
Then I said, ""Fuck it, I'ma handle my business""  (Yeah, yeah)
I did one-eighty to talk to one lady
She been regulatin' on how I feel (Yeah)
Describe it as raw and real (Yeah)
I'm dealin' with all the ills
I'm tearin' up like I'm on Dr. Phil (What?)
Ain't no use, you gotta walk (Walk)
