We that generation

[Verse 1: Deniro Farrar]
All of my youngin's some savages
Run in your trap, hit you up for them packages
Rob you for bricks, finesse you for pounds
Fuck all that talkin', they layin' you down
That'll teach niggas 'bout playin' around
Cartel connected, you better respect it
Fuck up the paper, send you to your maker
They layin' you 6 feet under the ground
Ridin' with choppas, masked up like Chewbacca
Got dreads like a Rasta, free all of my patnas
This one for Sosa and Gio, I got yah
Bentley, what's happenin'? Lil ToeNail what's crackin'?
Dub, TG, DuRu what it do?
Don Don, I see you laid back and be cool
I'm fuckin' this ho and she wet as a pool
I'm feedin' her dick and you buyin' her food
Shoppin' and robbin' and robbin' and shoppin'
Break bread with my niggas, you know how we rockin'
Hittin' these licks and countin' this cake
I don't give a fuck, I'm bearin' my face
Hopin' I live to see me a new day
E got that choppa and ready to spray
I'm runnin' through bitches, what more can I say?
Kush came from Cali, shout out to the Bay

It's get rich or die tryin' like that nigga 50
And I'm about to go dumb like Timmy
You ain't talkin' money, we look at you funny
Lil nigga you wastin' your breath
I told my niggas, ""I'll see you at dinner""
We eatin' 'til nothin' is left
My bro in the kitchen, he chef
But he keep the TEC, you would think he a ref
That 30 on me like I'm Steph
But all my bitches as jazzy as Jeff, Fresh
Prince in the city of Queens
Chasin' that sack 'til they crown me a king
Sacramento home team
I'm better than clever, ball harder than Webber whenever
Whoever however they want it
No competition, ain't got no opponents
My seat at the throne, they can't stand that
Cause I Eminem, Kim and Stan rap
A nigga might start shootin' if I don't know y'all
My city made a nigga's heart so cold, dog
Your bitch got nice lips and I'm like road dog
Pour 4's 'til I'm throwed off
The biggest menace since Dennis and O-Dawg (Aye)

To keep it one hunnit, I'd rather get blunted

They run in your spot for the cash
A bitch nigga run up, I post up with gunnas

I'm up 'til the sun up, I'm juugin' with Bird
No Stunna, we overgrind hard for this cash
We ain't kiddin' like JK, my homeboy got an AK
Only aimin' where your hood hang
It rock-a-fella like Just Blaze
The AK MJ how it give fades
Pussy niggas Shaq feet, boy you been gay
These niggas MIA like where the Heat stay
I'ma catch 'em with the work in the breezeway
Better freeze or catch a bullet like a Brees play
We need cake like a B-Day
I hang with my niggas, my niggas my woes
Don't fuck with too many cause niggas be hoes
Bitches ain't shit, they gon' fuck with your foe
All for the smash so I'm passin' a ho
Sprint to the money, I dash and I go
Cause niggas be bitches and actin' like hoes
Be screamin' ""Fuck 12"" when they call em' the most

[Verse 4: DuRu Tha King]
Nigga go crazy on yappas
Run with them choppas, cookin' up beef with that China
I'm a young nigga who's solid
Max on that shotta, Dub TG that's on my mama
Show me a check or show me respect
Either way it go, I'm comin' for necks
These bitches around me, they know I got next
You takin' her out, I'm takin' her mouth
She strip on the side, I'm dick on the side
Broke down a whole brick and got rich on the side
Come to my crib, you see killas inside
Shout out to Beata, I'm from the north side
Bless up to Ghetty, I love the west side
Thuggin', thuggin', thuggin', thuggin' it out
Boy you shouldnâ€™t doubt, come to my city, you might not get out
Niggas be claimin' they know me, don't know what you talkin' about
Nigga don't try to lil' bro me, you'll get a gun in your mouth
My nigga that's not a real Rollie, why are you playin' around?
See you let these bitches control you, you are not fit for the crown
Kings

Alonzo,Faded Out My Mind,"1 ContributorAngels & Demons Lyrics[Intro]
You're a demon and I'm an angel
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Hook]
You're a demon and I'm an angel
I'ma go to heaven and you gon go to hell
I could see it in your eyes, every single lie
You cast a love spell, do you feel helpful?
You're a demon and I'm an angel
I'ma go to heaven and you gon go to hell
I could see it in your eyes, every single lie
You cast a love spell, do you feel helpful?

[Verse]
The way you broke my heart feels like you're doing surgery
Diamonds in my head, yeah can't keep sleeping
Faded out my mind every single weekend
With a new bitch in the black Benz tweaking
Pop a bean, molly in my cup now
Both know, I just wanna be alone now
I don't wanna call home now, faded with my bros now
Don't got time for love guys
You broke my heart down, can you calm down?
You left me on the ground. there's no coming back now
It's like you took the one and you [?], our love's so jaded that's why i'm getting faded
Halo 3 energy sword to my throat, you're an infection- a real cutthroat
But you keep texting, texting my line
Do whatever with my love, I guess it's time to say goodbye
I guess it's time to say goodbye, say goodbye to your lies
Would you care if I died?
Would you care if I died?
Would you care if I died?

Every time you lie to me and every time you hurt me
I will still love you, no matter if I'm hurting
And every time you cry to me, I will be there by your side
To wipe those tears from your eyes, to make you feel alright inside
Are you here for the ride, till you ride down
Made me feel alright, are you here to die?Embed"
Alonzo,Late Nights,"9 ContributorsToo Many Walls Lyrics[Verse 1]
Wish on a rainbow
Is all I can do
Dream of the good times
That we never knew
No late nights alone in your arms
I'll dream on

Living in wonder
Thinking of you
Still looking for ways to uncover the truth
You're so young is all they can say
They don't know

If I could change the way of the world
I'd be your girl

[Chorus]
Too many walls
Have been built in between us
Too many dreams
Have been shattered around us

If I seem to give up
They'll still never win
Deep in my heart
I know the strength is within

Watching the others
Chances drift by
They'll never discover these feelings I hide
Deep inside
I'm falling apart
All alone with a broken heart

Thinking in silence
Is all they allow
These words still unspoken may never be found
All these dreams one day will be mine
They cross my mind

My time has yet to come
Until then

[Chorus]
Too many walls
Have been built in between us
Too many dreams
Have been shattered around us

If I seem to give up
They'll still never win
Deep in my heart
I know the strength is within
Ooh, yeah

[Chorus]
Too many walls
Have been built in between us
Too many dreams
Have been shattered around us

If I seem to give up
They'll still never win
Deep in my heart
I know the strength is within

Too many walls
Have been built in between us
Too many dreams
Have been shattered around us

If I seem to give up
They'll still never win
Deep in my heart
I know the strength is withinEmbed"

When I talk to you I feel like a boomer
I'm glad we never grew you would've been a tumor

Now I'm scared of the ocean
Cuz I don't want anymore leeches thinking I'm their friend

I can't keep myself open, can't keep on hoping
Cuz that's how it all beganEmbed"
Alonzo,Same Ole Shit,"23 ContributorsIt Sounded Like A Roc Lyrics[Intro: Subroc]
Ahh, shit! There it is, there it is, boy
Ahh, yeah!
There it is, there it is, buddy
Ahhh, yeah!
Yeah, yeah, they seem to know the time but, um.. let's see..
(Ah-ha, swing it)

[Verse 1: Subroc]
It's my thing! Yo, it's my thing!
The way I swing, not even an orangutan can hang on my DING-DING
Saved by the bell rang
I talk, yell, whisper, mumble street slang
With no doubt, you tumble if I flip
Don't make me shout with my vulgar lip
A hip-hugger, I'll mug ya, if fun to know
Slow and steady wins a race, I keeps a steady pace
In a chase, I'm bookin', cookin' feet don't fail me
5-0's can't see me, catch me to jail me
Walk the plank, ya damn dime droppers
Snitches get stitches, why, oh, why does my trigger finger itches?
Corrupt! I follow my nose â€” it always knows it
Open the draw bridge â€” close it! Close it!
A doo doo lyric, I snuck in 'cause I chose it
Long ding-a-ling dong there, big booties grows it
Up! (Up!), up and awaaaay, we go across the border
To Mexico, suck my toe
Doo doo brown's my color
No watered down, no cut
A jewel to a fool is like pearls to big butt
Ahh, swine, I strut on the sidewalk and don't touch the line
Escalate, never decline
I'm gonna get mine, don't try to take mine
No, my kneecaps ain't blacker than my black behind
The bush, I touch tush
So beware of the grin of my evil eyeball glare
I's a wiseguy, yeah, a smart alec
Like it, or kiss me where the sun don't shine like metallic
KA-BLAOW!

[Verse 2: Subroc]
One-double-nine-tre, dumbbells I lift it
Just for the taste of it, coke I won't sniff it
Ya party pooper, you'll never stop my frontings
Like Jesse Owens, Iâ€™ll dust ya, I run tings!
Popcorn mama, you can sniff my sock
I's a hard headed nigga, my head is (Like a rock)
So, so, leave me, B-boy, I'll be boppin'
When I chug-a-lug alone, it ain't no stoppin'
Hop in skin to skin, now I must stall
Jim hats ain't even made like rubbermaid, at all
If I be over stressed, over tryin' under arms
Cookin' like onions, you'll be cryin'
Boo-hoo-hoo! But I get the hoorays
From sunrise, to sunset for days
All in the Kool-Aid, don't know the flavor
Taste buds are shot, waistlines duds
I left the slammer on bad-ass behavior
Call me Sub, I roll underground like C.H.U.D.'s
Cease with the wack, I'm never ever booty over that
I got my cootie shots for the cootie for the body
The hottie, I might use Karate
(Snap back!) 15 minutes I'll be off duty
KA-BLAMM

[Zev Love X]
It's a break, Zev Love X and Subroc for Ninety Tre
Crew massive deep
Constipated Monkeys deficatin' that old hard shit
And ya don't quit!

[Verse 3: Subroc]
It sounded like a what?! It sounded like a boulder
It sounded like a Land, yo, slide up over
I need my room, to huff and puff
These bastards be soft like marshmallow fluff
Step up, wrong move you catch a back smack
Or a blackout, so be out, black!
Let's play catch, a bad one ya caught it
I'll take your thumpin' heart and smote it
Then I grab my wood (my dick), I grab my rope
Over there ya got that same ole shit, here ya don't
Oh, no, you don't, gimme that, back
Now you sing the blues while your eye's black
Don't need to flaunt, no need to front
I see right through, you very blunt
Attitude nonchalant, I do what I want
If I be ghost, expect me back to haunt

I get a set alone
Dancing with myself
Greedy go-getter gone

I get into my bed
I do it to myself

To the lo-o-o-o-ocal (Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh)

[Verse 2]
