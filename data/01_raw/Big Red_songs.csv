I tapped on your window on your darkest night
The shape of you was jagged and weak
There was nowhere for me to stay, but I stayed anyway
And if I would've known
How many pieces you had crumbled into
I might have let them lay

[Chorus: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Justin Vernon]
Are you really gonna talk about timing in times like these?
And let all your damage damage me
And carry your baggage up my street
And make me your future history, it’s time
You've come a long way, open the blinds, let me see your face
You wouldn't be the first renegade to need somebody

[Post-Chorus: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Justin Vernon]
Is it insensitive for me to say
""Get your shit together so I can love you""?
Is it really your anxiety that stops you
From giving me everything
Or do you just not want to?

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
I tapped on your window on your darkest night
The shape of you was jagged and weak
There was nowhere for me to stay, but I stayed anyway
You fire off missiles ’cause you hate yourself
But do you know you're demolishing me?
And then you squeeze my hand as I'm about to leave

You wouldn't be the first renegade to need somebody

[Post-Chorus: Taylor Swift with Justin Vernon]
Is it insensitive for me to say
""Get your shit together so I can love you""?
Is it really your anxiety that stops you
From giving me everything
Or do you just not want to?

[Bridge: Taylor Swift]
And if I would've known
How sharp the pieces were you'd crumbled into
I might’ve let them lay

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
Are you really gonna talk about timing in times like these?
And let all your damage damage me
And carry your baggage up my street
And make me your future history, it’s time
You've come a long way, open the blinds, let me see your face
You wouldn’t be the first renegade to need somebody
[Outro: Taylor Swift, Justin Vernon]
To need somebody, to need somebody
To need somebody, to need
Are you really gonna talk about timing in times like these?
And let all your damage damage me
And carry your baggage up my street
And make me your future history, it's time
Is it insensitive for me to say
""Get your shit together so I can love you""?
You've come a long way, open the blinds, let me see your face
You wouldn't be the first renegade to need somebody
Is it really your anxiety that stops you
From giving me everything

The way I woke up was old
Was all fucking choke
And it ain't easier after a week
We're on a long byway standing

Well, if you cannot tell I'll tell you right away
If I'll stay a spell, or if I cannot stay
I am less at ease, not the best at these
See the forest trees, call what's these what's these

Out in the loading bay light
Watching the fog recede
Divided the flame you slowly gave to me
Sign of relief in my mind
But I only caught you the one time
Later I'd watch you and wonder what it was like

[Pre-Chorus: Robin Pecknold]
How do you bear the full weight?
How does the long way feel?
Kneading your hand too tight against the wheel?
How do you stay in that tower?
How do you reckon your own power?
How does the wheel not turn hour on hour on hour?

I was trying to find my way

Stacked yourself against the odds
Talkin' back to an act of God

There the bell tolls noon on 12th and Vine
And I still need this overtime
'Cause I'm over myself
I'm over the hill
I'm Over-the-Rhine
For the millionth time

[Verse 1]
I park at this spot and stare at the water
Try to remember I'm somebody's father
Dawn commute across Covington Bridge
Get lost in my head, just looking at it
Now I'm looking at you
Through the hole in my sheet
And I still need this overtime

[Chorus 1]
'Cause I'm over myself

Stop the traffic lights
Cycle up Price Hill

Now, look at that road
Look at that climb
When it's throwing in a nickel or get out a dime
Too patterned, too close
Too flattered, too broke
Now look at you go

[Pre-Chorus]
Took the morning to float
Took the morning to find
I got a vision of a mission but an awkward vibe
Too livid, too scared
Too loving, too closed
Now look at you know

[Chorus]
When the cause is dead on arrival
And you coulda, shoulda, woulda for free
Now look at your post script, every minute
It's a very slow thing to have glean, now

So maybe you know
Or maybe you don't

There's little lakes, there's little fountains
There's little molehills made out of mountains
There's little prayers that I perceive, ah

[Verse 2: Anaïs Mitchell]
Every time I drive up on fifty-four
It goes past Mick's and Dick's general store
There goes the signal, it's dropped for miles
There goes the static at the top of the dial
Every wild land screened in
By only a hundred years of white men

[Chorus: Anaïs Mitchell, Anaïs Mitchell & Justin Vernon ]
Who am I to witness, who am I to see
Who am I to notice which way a tree
Falling alone falls silently

[Verse 3: Anaïs Mitchell]
Half a mile later, just past the sign
There's a Winnebago, an Econoline
I smell the lake on up aways
I know the exit and the parking place

To say the things I want to say to you would be a crime
To admit I'm still in love with you even after all this time
I'd rather let you touch my arm until you die
Seduce me with your charms until I'm drunk on them
Go home and drink in bed and never let myself be in love like that again

Light a cigarette and think of you and walk away
Turning all the words around in my head, I won't stay
Because of all these triangles and squares
The memory we seem to share replays a distant love that plays my records on

By the time I get the courage I am drunk and you are tired

I love my mom pops and sis\
I been around since the filming of French Kiss and been in the city like Fresh prince\
I'm an educated fellow no plot thicken just an inference\
This gift wrapped bar seasoned with an army tan\
Watch Out 4 haters cause I see them from afar like loose dogs in protected no harm fam\
I'm trying to a deal with lord bishop make it knock and cassidy\
To put the pieces in order Big Jim has to zigzag through lanes bring my knight then go up and down like a room see\
Trial and error that's how most dogs learn bars shaping history Victorian\
We can detect southern accents and. Famous black waitresses count in stacks on mattresses\
I'm prim and proper playing roles call it Mary Poppins medicine down in the most delightful way\
A spiteful sway from set out of fate\
Bullhorn blow you can't understand me I'm not homeless red hair Annie\
More puns than the laugh factory\
I took the world by storm not x men but when I assimilate lines morphed into Cyborg\
I don't repeat myself you luck fly heard what I said\
Economics goes up and the supply goes down leaving plebians with faces rough red\You might also likeEmbed"

Looked like a heart attack
Looked like pain
Looked like it

Look the sun
Green May seasons
Look an angel

Look the distance
Look home
Look the feeling
Or a fever

He looks like a sun
On my back
Felt like it

He looked like a sun
On my back
Felt like it

It's not what you thought
When you first began it
You got what you want
Now you can hardly stand it, though
By now you know

You're sure there's a cure
And you have finally found it
You think one drink
Will shrink you till you're underground
And living down

But it's not going to stop
It's not going to stop
It's not going to stop
'Til we wise up
