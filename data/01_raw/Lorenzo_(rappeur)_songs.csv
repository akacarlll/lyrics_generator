Gusto kitang iwasan
Por favor por favor
Ayaw kang mahawakan
Por favor por favor
Di ako tinatamaan
Por favor por favor
Ayaw kang mahawakan

Uno dos
Pagbilang ng tatlo
'Di ka ba aalis
Ayoko ng ganito
Vibe with me
If you wanna see me fly
Ride with me
If you wanna see me die
Holla wait
'Di ka ba nakakaintindi
Tapos pinagsamahan
Tapos na ang gabi
Night stand, no bands
Yeah we kissing for fun
I'm done, I quit
Yeah we doing this once
