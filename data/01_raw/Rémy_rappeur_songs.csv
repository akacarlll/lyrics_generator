Rémy (rappeur),Daydreaming,"1 ContributorDaydreaming Lyrics[Intro: Abstract]
Daydreamin', daydreamin'

[Chorus: Abstract]
Daydreamin', daydreamin'
Oh oh, we daydreamin', daydreamin'
They say we do it right, say we made for the life
Strivin' for better days so we don't sleep at night
No no, we daydreamin', daydreamin' (Daydreamin')
Oh oh, we daydreamin', daydreamin' (Daydreamin')
They say we do it right, say we made for the life
Strivin' for better days so we don't sleep at night
No no, we daydreamin', daydreamin' (Daydreamin')
Oh oh, we daydreamin', daydreamin' (Daydreamin')

[Verse 1: Hendersin]
Word to my craft like NASA
Yеs I'm the answer, I ain't evеn ask it
Wanna get it started we can go and get it started
But I bet in the end that I'm probably gon' pass ya
No disaster (Nah)
Chasin dreams like liquor
You spit sick, I spit it sicker
You just mad 'cause I run this shit
Yeah, I run this shit
You just a kicker
End of point, you still don't get it (Nah)
Fuck it, I don't need your credit (Nah)
Had to do it on my own
Didn't need a team, I just did an edit
Nights alone (Alone), microphone ('Phone)
In the microzone (Zone), they ain't like the tone (Tone)
Now they mad 'cause I'm makin' hits
Yeah, I'm makin' hits like Al Capone
Had drive like Ryan, live like I'm dyin'
Flow I'm supplyin', no denyin'
Lace like I'm tyin', y'all can't ply in
I kept flyin' so damn high
And no, I ain't slowin' down
Tetris shit is going down
Just know if you tryna ball, expect to fall
Expect to get thrown around, uh
Focus on a new position, even with a new condition
Make 'em disappear, motherfucker, like a new magician
Sky is the limit, you would think that the roof miss 'em
Aw yeah, focus on a new position, even with a new condition
Make 'em disappear, motherfucker, like a new magician
Sky is the limit, you would think that the roof miss 'em
Aw yeah

[Verse 2: J-Remy]
Yo, what's up? J-Remy
I'm caught up in that daydream
It's day one with that same team
And I'm 18 and I'm too real to understand what that fake means
Like damn, rappin' with Hendersin, sippin' on Hennessy
Make 'em remember me
I got a tendency killin' my enemies
Doin' it endlessly, while gettin' so faded
Say that you hate it, I'm all in your playlist, like secret-related
What are you sayin'? Too busy prayin'
One day we'll make it and then celebrate it
With models and bottles and everything else
They offer me help, but wait 'til tomorrow
Wait till mañana, you'll be a goner
Came, saw, you know I conquered, I must be a monster
I'm hittin' Rihanna, hittin' Beyonce
Hangin' with Andre, sippin' on Bombay, okay
Maybe one day, despite what some say
Remy did this or Remy did that
Fuck that other person, I don't give an exact
I'm layin' out facts, don't sample on my raps
I'm sleepin' on rappers like naps, lost up on my Mac
Gettin' those racks on top of those racks
And I'm caught up in that daydream
It's day one, same team
And I'm 18 and I'm too real to understand what that fake means
Caught up in that daydream
And I'm caught up in that daydream
Remy
[Chorus: Abstract]
Daydreamin', daydreamin'

No no, we daydreamin', daydreamin' (Daydreamin')
Oh oh, we daydreamin', daydreamin' (Daydreamin')
They say we do it right, say we made for the life
Strivin' for better days so we don't sleep at night
No no, we daydreamin', daydreamin' (Daydreamin')
Oh oh, we daydreamin', daydreamin' (Daydreamin')Embed"
Rémy (rappeur),You Don’t Know Me,"1 ContributorYou Don’t Know Me Lyrics[Intro]
Hey
Did you think I'd let you get away with that?
Wrong side of town
I'm the Backwoods Legend

[Verse 1: J-Remy]
You gave it a shot, the pistol was hot
The barrel was loaded, your gun wouldn't cock
So halt (you don't know me)
Stop the assault
Your ammo was weak like rock salt
It's not my fault, that's all you got
Blank rounds and negative props
It's all that pops, you start your talking
A sniper can hit what he's stalking
(You missed) You're a dead man walking
(One wish) I'll grant your pardon
(Forgiveness) For the bull you started
You at your best is me at half-hearted
So check the credentials, it's like missiles and pistols
We in different leagues, the same game
So head to the range and practice your aim

[Hook]
You think you know what I'm all about (you don't know me)
You think you've got me all figured out (you don't know me)
You think you've know me, but you really don't
You don't know, you don't know
You think you know what I'm all about (you don't know me)
You think you've got me all figured out (you don't know me)
It's best to keep my name out your mouth
You don't know, you don't know
You don't know me

I came in the game, aimin' for change
Outta they range, blowin' they brains
Industry lies, the industry tries
To figure me out and wiggle me out
But what I'm about is bigger than me
And harder to see just lookin' at me
I paint it words, speak it in curbs
Write it rhymes, challenge the minds
Balance the times, lookin' through eyes
Given to me to the better the lives
Of others' brothers, others' mothers
Others' cousins, sisters, lovers
Whoever's in need, whoever takes heed
Whoever believes, whoever receives
Not from me, but Him
Who gave me this message to spread to the end

[Hook]
You think you know what I'm all about (you don't know me)
You think you got me all figured out (you don't know me)
You think you've know me, but you really don't
You don't know, you don't know
You think you know what I'm all about (you don't know me)
You think you've got me all figured out (you don't know me)
It's best to keep my name out your mouth
You don't know, you don't know
You don't know me
[Verse 3: Pigeon John]
The name is Pigeon John
People, don't get it wrong
I know that you think I'm silly
But really, that's the j-jam in every song
I hear what you be sayin'
""Pigeon is not on track
All he be doin' is writin' about
The ladies and how they never be comin' back""
That is not so
Well, kinda though
Gotta be real, understandin' me, bro
I try a lot, my people see through that
I spit the real and I'll deal with the facts
God is love, we push and shove
But all we is point fingers and judge
You can do that and just live in your world
But I'm gonna be lovin', I'm gonna unfurl

[Hook]
You think you know what I'm all about (you don't know me)
You think you've got me all figured out (you don't know me)
You think you know me, but you really don't
You don't know, you don't know
You think you know what I'm all about (you don't know me)
You think you've got me all figured out (you don't know me)
It's best to keep my name out your mouth
You don't know, you don't know
You don't know meEmbed"
