K-mel,Nine Million Bicycles,"15 ContributorsNine Million Bicycles Lyrics[Chorus]
There are nine million bicycles in Beijing
That's a fact
It's a thing we can't deny
Like the fact that I will love you till I die

[Verse 1]
We are twelve billion light years from the edge
That's a guess
No one can ever say it's true
But I know that I will always be with you

[Verse 2]
I'm warmed by the fire of your love everyday
So don't call me a liar
Just believe everything that I say
There are six billion people in the world
More or less, and it makes me feel quite small
But you're the one I love the most of all

[Bridge]
We're high on the wire
With the world in our sight
And I'll never tire
Of the love that you give me every night

There are nine million bicycles in Beijing
That's a fact
It's a thing we can't deny
Like the fact that I will love you till I die
And there are nine million bicycles in Beijing

EPIC RAP BATTLES OF POKEMON
CREEPY BLACK
VS
LOST SILVER
BEGIN!

[Verse 1: Lost Silver]
I'M DEAD, I want to live to spit this curse at you
Turn back now or you'll be sent to your doom
Cyndaquil says ""HURRY"" 'cause this GHOST will be Unown
I'll leave you in chains like the Pokémon I own
The forgotten hero haunts this spawn of Lavender Town
This is the battle of your life. The run option's not allowed
LEAVE, or it'll be your soul that I pilfer
In this battle of horrors, you'll take second place silver

[Verse 2: Creepy Black]
Black's here to hack through your silver soul and brain
You think you'll win? Man, the word ""Lost"" is in your name
GHOST is in your party, the Lavender Town sprite spirit
I'll curse you first, even though in Generation 1, that move wasn't in it
You can't stеp to me. Hell, you can't step at all
Can't catch this brawling ghost insidе a Pokéball
You're too scared to move. You're about to get owned
And on the place I finish you off, there'll stand a tombstone

NOMORE, Your raps are giving me FRUSTRATION
You can't K.O. me! This will be my domination
Celebi will sing a Perish Song and have our Pain Split
Your data will be erased! REST IN 8 BITS

[Verse 4: Creepy Black]
Don't be giving me that Mean Look, or I'll use my Curse ability
You're Lost, Silver, when you come up against me
I murder every trainer I face. Don't even bother to fight
It's time to put you to sleep, 'cause this is your very last night

[Verse 5: BRVR]
Do you love me? If not, I'll use my thunderbolt
I know you'll never leave once I catch your souls
It's so cold down here, but my rhymes are so hot
Like what my owner did to me, I'll leave you all to ROT
You don't know the pain that's going in my chest
All of you were lying to me when you said your disses were the best
I'd rather die than listen to your lame excuses of raps
When you see my plushy in the room, it'll end in a BLOODBATH

[Verse 6: Buried Alive]
Let me come out from the ground and make you stop your strife
My time to shine and finally rip apart your lives
It's over, Pikachu, Nowhere to run and nowhere to hide
'Cause all you flee in fright when BURIEDALIVE wants to fight
Won't be tame when I've glitched your game, you're lame, will never be saved
'Cause my claim to fame: taking jokes like you to your graves
Finally, fresh meat, I've been waiting almost a century
You've reached the final floor! Now it's time to get BURIED
[Verse 7: Missingno.]
The true killer king has arrived to break your demise
No one will be missing you when I make you all di-I-I-I-I-I-I-e
Your pants, you'll be splitting when Missingno.'s spitting
These lyrics were written in the blood that's dripping
From your quitting, barely living heads since I'm hitting and ripping
There's missing-no way you'll win versus this verbal ass-kicking
Time's ticking, and ticking, and I'm winning, and grinning
I'm the glitching killing forbidden beginning of your spine-splitti-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-ing

[Verse 8: Strangled Red]
I have no reason to be here, but I'll take you all down anyways
You guys thinking you're the best has driven me even more crazed
In a world that cheated me, why should I play fair?
Just like me when Miki died, you'll all be driven to despair
I'll kill you all, I'm gonna do it, you don't wanna know what's going in my mind
This win is MINE, your guys' victory is something you can't find
Nothing can be saved now, prepare your necks, I'll strangle you all, there won't be a reset
When you step up to me, you'll end up dead, with the last thing you see is the color of red

[Verse 9: White Hand]
I can't believe you think that you all understand
You're nothing, but at least now you're in my hand
Crashing through this battle, rapping 'till you faint from this happening
Taking over your game 'cause your bodies aren't the only thing I'm hacking
Trust me, you'll be missing with no one to find the remains
All of you are fighting for supremacy, but your rapping's the same
Make all the noises you want. It'll prove to be futile
When I rip you into pieces, you'll know I made this battle BRUTAL
[Verse 10: Hypno's Lullaby]
Come with me, little children, Safe and happy you'll all be
As you rest in your beds and I DEVOUR ALL YOUR DREAMS
Don't cry, it's fine. Hypno wouldn't hurt a fly
Fortunately, all of you are NON-INVERTEBRATE SLIME
Got to Hand it to you, White. At least you proved you aren't the worst
Because Missingno. blew for every second of his verse
Hypno lied to you all. Sorry, now you're dead and done
Stay with me forever, we'll have so much fun

[Verse 11: Lavender Town Syndrome]
Come and listen to my song, I'll make all your ears bleed
You'll all be suicidal in this battle, don't believe me?
Step out of the cave, into the town and feel my power
More fearsome than the ghost of Marowak who haunts this tower
Any child who plays with me will end up being dead and severed
I'll corrupt all of you, showing you who should be feared
You think you're scary? I've got zombie Pokémon on my side
Challenging me to a battle? Better get ready to hide

[Verse 12: Ash's Coma]
I leave my home, start my journey all alone
No...(I'll catch 'em all) No... (Number one) I'll leave YOU all in a coma
Your theories aren't eerie. They're ethereal diseases
I'm the leader, and I'll turn you into Ash for your treason
(Listen!) My vision's blurry...(Stop! Pikachu!) I can't see...
I thought we were all a team. Maybe this is just a dream
Your existence is fiction. You'd rather hurt than feel hurting
Time to show you what I've learned on my Pokémon journey
Stage 1: Strike you with a bolt of lightning in my pocket
(Pikachu!) Stage 2: Ignite your fire and blast you like Team Rocket
Stage 3: Water Gun you down with flows you can't test
Stage 4: Make new friends and become the very best
If this is all in my head, sprawled in a hospital bed
Then I'm forever indebted to recycle the REM
Come on, You pasta peoples can't quite catch up!
Well, this battle is done, so let me pull the plug

[Outro]
Who Won?
Who's Next?

K-mel,I Will Be There,"4 ContributorsI Will Be There Lyrics[Verse 1]
She is like the lady down the road
Or just the woman up the street
Like any mother you may know
To me, she is the one who had it planned
To lead us all to Wonderland
She always wanted us to go

[Chorus]
And she said
Don't ever be lonely
Remember, I'll always care
Wherever you may be
Remember I will be there

[Verse 2]
And like another lady that we know
She has a smile so bright and sweet
And hair as white as driven snow
Though life is never easy day to day
She has a very special way
To make us smile when we are low

[Chorus]
And she says
Don't ever be lonely
Remember, I'll always care
Wherever you may be
Remember I will be there

K-mel,I Cried for You,"9 ContributorsI Cried for You Lyrics[Verse 1]
You're beautiful so silently
It lies beneath a shade of blue
It struck me so violently
When I looked at you
But others pass; they never pause
To feel that magic in your hand
To me, you're like a wild rose
They never understand why

[Chorus]
I cried for you, and the sky cried for you
And when you went, I became a hopeless drifter
But this life was not for you though I learned from you
That beauty need only be a whisper

[Verse 2]
I'll cross the sea
For a different world
With your treasure, a secret
For me to hold

In many years they may forget
This love of ours or that we met
They may not know how much you meant
To me

K-mel,The Closest Thing to Crazy,"15 ContributorsThe Closest Thing to Crazy Lyrics[Verse 1]
How can I think I'm standing strong
Yet feel the air beneath my feet?
How can happiness feel so wrong?
How can misery feel so sweet?
How can you let me watch you sleep
Then break my dreams the way you do?
How can I have got in so deep?
Why did I fall in love with you?

[Chorus]
This is the closest thing to crazy I have ever been
Feeling twenty-two, acting seventeen
This is the nearest thing to crazy I have ever known
I was never crazy on my own
And now I know that there's a link between the two
Being close to craziness and being close to you

[Verse 2]
How can you make me fall apart
Then break my fall with loving lies?
It's so easy to break a heart
It's so easy to close your eyes
How can you treat me like a child
Yet like a child I yearn for you?
How can anyone feel so wild?
How can anyone feel so blue?

K-mel,If You Were a Sailboat,"6 ContributorsIf You Were a Sailboat LyricsIf you're a cowboy I would trail you
If you're a piece of wood I'd nail you to the floor
If you're a sailboat I would sail you to the shore
If you're a river I would swim you
If you're a house I would live in you all my days
If you're a preacher I'd begin to change my ways

Sometimes I believe in fate
But the chances we create
Always seem to ring more true
You took a chance on loving me
I took a chance on loving you

If I was in jail I know you'd spring me
If I was a telephone you'd ring me all day long
If was in pain I know you'd sing me soothing songs

Sometimes I believe in fate
But the chances we create
Always seem to ring more true
You took a chance on loving me
I took a chance on loving you

If I was in darkness you would lead me to the light

Your scent upon my pillow
And then I'll say goodbye
To your whispers in my dreams
And then our lips will part
In my mind and in my heart
'Cause your kiss
Went deeper than my skin
Piece by piece
Is how I'll let go of you
Kiss by kiss
Will leave my mind one at a time
One at a time
First of all must fly
My dreams of you and I
There's no point in holding on to those
And then our ties will break
For your and my own sake
Just remember
This is what you chose
Piece by piece
Is how I'll let go of you
Kiss by kiss
Will leave my mind one at a time
One at a time
I'll shed like skin
Our memories of lazy days
And fade away the shadow of your face

I'm going to find a happy
I'm going to find a happy
I'm going to find a happy place

[Verse 1]
Seven thousand eyes are watching
Marching home, and no one's touching
Army of the city workers
Secretaries, lawyers, brokers
Heading for a London station
Heading for a quick salvation
Oblivious to cherry cola
Trying to sell to every stranger

[Pre-Chorus]
Stuck here; it's cold, I'm standing
Hoping for some understanding
Only way to go is inside

[Chorus]
I'm going to find a happy
I'm going to find a happy
I'm going to find a happy place

[Verse 2]
Seven thousand light years travel
Let my sense of time unravel
Trapped feelings are never ending
Send those weaknesses descending
Towards the Earth's red center
Let the fire rise and enter
Tap into the primal power
Rising like a giant tower

[Parte I: ""Dorian Grey"" prod. Mark Tembo]

[Intro]
Yo, Kid Yugi anti-idolo
Ah-ah
Tembo hit
Yo, bella Real Talk, bella Kuma, bella Bosca, bella Khaled
Qua è Kid Yugi from Massafra, T-A, ci siamo

[Strofa]
Ho preso trenta saponette, nessuno mi dice: ""Gay""
Venti punti sulla faccia, Big Yugi il vero Scarface
Ho sentito la tua musica, ho pensato ""Shame""
Sto trattando con gli zingari cugini a Moira Orfei
Mi misgenderano, al ristorante mi danno del lei
Mi consumo molto prima del mio expiration day
In casa sette uomini, cuciniamo la K
Rapperei di morte pure sopra un beat di Drake, take
Risolviamola col sangue, non faccio le Instagram flame
Wall of death, hall of fame, drive by, shoot race
Mask on come Bane, ti sto addosso come un plaid
Per me è un gioco da ragazzi, Blue Whale
Cacciachene mudifichete, ma 'u stesso te fanno i bochere
'I 'uagnune mi' so 'i megghie, mango 'i vide ca se movene
Parto da Massafra, dec'ore, stoco a Real Talk
Purte 'i solde ci vuò 'a polvere, ci no te fanno a stozzere
Ah, sono biglotta
Se non mi trovi in Puglia, sono da Artie in Bicocca
Tagliavamo il prodotto, facevamo la ricotta
Questa è merda da gang, vengo a farti la cappotta
Ti prendiamo a schiaffi come Sciarra Colonna
'Sta roba è tagliata, Massafra non è Colombia
Puzzo proprio di luppolo, acqua di colonia
Neve come in Lapponia, Wockhardt come in Polonia
Io sono Big Yugi, straight outta Terronia
Il mio ritratto che peggiora come quello di Dorian
Poesia cimiteriale, binaurale, Lavandonia
Prendo i sali da bagno, esco a fare baldoria
Tu eri un big, ma finisci a farmi warm up
Devo cambiare il gioco, devo lasciare un'impronta
Vengo dal vero nulla, trappavamo in una grotta
O Ilva o camorra, o galera o tomba
La gogna o la forca, niente VIP, niente star
Niente luce, solo ombra
Smetto con lo spaccio, inizio con il rap
Il portafoglio è più leggero perché mo sono sul conto
Ora è un software che li conta

Yo

[Strofa]
Kid cazzo di Yugi, il nuovo volto del diavolo
Sposato col denaro, non voglio tornare scapolo
Cambio il game, gli altri gridano al miracolo
Scendevo in gravina alla ricerca del papavero
Voglio arricchirmi, mangiare solo col bavero
In bagno in discoteca spendevo di più di un tavolo
Comandamenti del commercio, decalogo
Un lusso da campo rom, neve come a Capo Nord
Ah, yeah, più storie del Decameron
Ho più di un amico con il padre all'ergastolo
L'occhio nel triangolo, un pacco quanto un pargolo
Per i cavalli il pungolo, non è musica, è un rantolo
Ricettazione, un garage è un ricettacolo
Ho robe nel cazzo, le piscio come un calcolo
Chiaroveggenza, oracolo
Dieci K mentre mi scaccolo, non è un bello spettacolo
Ne ho presa troppa, son rimasto toccato
Giubbotto taroccato, cervello diroccato
Sto come allo sciroccato, liquido sciroppato
Pugliesi escono il ferro se vengono spintonati
Guadagno uguale anche se il prezzo è aumentato
Tentato omicidio, voglio togliere il ""tentato""
Tabagismo da rehab, fumo dov'è vietato
Oppio come in Vietnam, spontaneo
Rispetto un rapper solo se viene carcerato o se viene studiato
Tutto il resto è fuffa, è logica di mercato
Alla tua home invasion con il passo felpato
Un nemico è un nemico perché ormai è stato flaggato

Ah, Kid Yugi anti-idolo

[Strofa]
Kid Yugi, tre cuori di inchiostro come un polpo
Precipito da anni, ancora non tocco il fondo
Ero holo, mi sentivo common
Alcol fino al midollo, un SOS su un nastro la musica che droppo
Mordimi il torso, poi sputa il torsolo, lasciami un goccio
'Sti giorni sanguino come un emofilo, emotion
Le rinomino così fingo che non provo solo odio
Non fermo lo sterminio neanche se mi immolo
Ho chiesto aiuto al cielo, mi ha dato tempesta
L'ho chiesto alla terra, mi dà terremoto
L'ho chiesto all'uomo, mi ha sparato addosso
A una donna e mi dà solo il corpo
Manco droga mi dà più conforto
Fanculo le cazzate per le quali mi ammorbo
Le puttanate per cui perdo il sonno
Le sigarette per cui perdo il fiato, il fiato per cui perdo il mondo
Mancanze che so, abbondanze che non riconosco
Il veleno che sorseggio, la droga che maneggio
Se la assumo, vaneggio
La musica mi esce solo se mi danneggio
Ora che ci guadagno produco come un marchingegno
I vincitori scrivono la storia, ma i perdenti scrivono meglio
Tu puoi solo farmi male perché non sai farmi peggio
C'è chi schiaccia e chi muore, non esiste pareggio
Kid Yugi
[Parte IV: ""Fall out"" prod. Swan]

Yo, Kid Yugi
Ah

Vero Kid sulla track, la trap, lo scam sopra il crime
Ci insegue l'FBI,  pluggo Wuthering heights
Ero diverso, ero shiny, è un B-movie, è sci-fi
Get G or die tryin', in Puglia stiamo sul vibe
Vero Kid sopra il gore, lo show, il groove, metto il NOS
Cinche gramme de polvere, scioco a cinche pescotte

Coltelli tirabusciòn, vieni qua, vai in shell shock

Siamo il diritto, lo ius, dalle trap house senza lusso
Sî nu sucche de frutta, ch'me no fé 'u de cchiù
Siamo allo zenit, al vertice, YanGL
Mezzo K di merce, mi traccia l'intelligence
Non mi posso far prendere, sto col mio doppelganger
Sotto cassa sintetiche, il suono scassa le vertebre
Rocks, no Percocet, concentrato di tenebre
Esalazioni mefitiche, formule ipermalefiche
Più swag di 'sti rapper, di tutti 'sti rapper
Sex appeal di Ed Kemper, OTK, faccio perfect, my dawg
Shout out, coltelli come gli scout
Satanassi, il side è south, due legnetti fanno un tao
Vendo l'anima al demonio, macrocosmo, dottor Faust
Genio, dottor House, underdog, underground
Bomba al neutrino, faccio partire il fallout
Lo faccio per T-A, non lo faccio per il clout
Flow pesa mille tera, manderemo in down il cloud
In giro coi miei dawg, glielo butto se è pawg
Stiamo nella traphouse, mica sopra Clubhouse
E questa non è trap, è il Libro rosso di Mao
Spingo per le quattro cifre sopra il body count
Dieci sopra il bank account, mezzo Bart mezzo Milhouse

Cause being born broke is the worst though
I’ve been on this feeling for a while it ain’t nice jo
Mammies they don't wanna mess with you nah boy
Walking in the mall looking at the things you can’t afford
Story of a youngin living ekasi
Before he got to Joburg he was living Emlazi
Saw the kasi life / Rich kids blowing money
Drinking out the bottle and surrounded by them mommies
He wanted that life so bad , He would kill for it
Started making new friends that will lead to it
Plans didn't work out / Parents didn't help
No money to eat at home , He just wanted swagger
You gotta work for what you want / Yeah mama said it
I'm on that hustle everyday praying that i get it
Cause people they never around when you ain’t got none
But after the riches they be sending accounts
Chorus

All i ever wanted was to go big
My name on your head / Face on the magazine
Being born broke made me wanna get it all

Flow gotta switch i'm starting not to like yall
I've been at it for a minute i think you should watch out
I'm so nice man the mirror gave me a high five
All that swerving you've been talking about will make you crash guys
Other homie told me that i'm too humble
I should be pissing on you niggas cause some trouble
I told him i'm just tryna make it out the bottom
I'm aiming for the stars i think somebody shot em
I cannot see these guys
All i can see is us /Man the east is up
All i see is us
Nam ngiphusha waya waya manje angifun ukwaz
Attitude is on who ? Asifun' ukwaz

Chorus

I'm the man outchea
Feeling like i'm the mayor
I can do what i can
I can just do whatever
I don't care how you feel
I'm just about my biz / I'm just about my biz
I came here to win

Verse 1

I'm writing this chilling in my room
Sipping on old buck thinking how far we done came
Now them homies close to the game
Look at us making a name
All i wanted was to see my niggas win
This is how we live going for the kill
Struggle everyday praying for a deal
Losing everything just for a win
(Bless)
The day that i met TuxX, Mano , Smart , Pk ,Vusi and Hype (Damn)
Veneration flag high / You the reason now i got the flag high
We were in my room writing songs everyday
TuxX on the beat , Got hype on the page
Picture so clear make a blind man say , this the shit you don't see everyday
My late sister bought our first mic
That's when i knew one day we gon shine
I believed in a dream that's mine
Rest in peace Lele , i'll make you proud
Years later still killing it boy
Got the Pm flag all on me boy
Gotta put my heart over these songs / Gotta leave something for the lil bro's

Chorus

I didn't make it out on my own
All i had was people that i know
Some they changed , Some they made me king
Fuck it all i wanted was to see my niggas win

I'm thinking about the shit that we went through and how we still living
Spending everyday in the kitchen busy cooking not eating
They said we will never make it out , we dreaming

Bless the day , Geonix Deep came in the set

K-mel,All Over the World,"30 ContributorsRoots Lyrics[Intro: Stogie T]
Ehh, Stogie T, Zakwe, ehh
Ha!

[Verse 1: Stogie T]
Before Nelson Mandela was on money
I was folding leopards, you would swear it's origami
Wild life lessons, every death gave me life
Still-born,  so me and Christ share a likeness
None like him, no Siamese, it's all timing
You can push, hope it come out live, but this ain't the gynae
Zakwe hit me like ""Let's talk about the rhyming""
Couldn't find the heart to tell him ""that's not my vibe see""
Not when the world need a Marley
And Bob's your uncle but you worry about your country
I don't take molly, I take lil' rocksy and my daughter
Out to get chiffon dresses from the shopping complex
And I'm not trying to shop a complex
I put my shit in the music so you can find strength
It's a lil' project I built from the onset
Ordinary people baptized now that's a John Legend
Born in Tanzania, that seems far-fetched
But none of you know the world that's in my closet
I make lines speak to the heart of the darkness
Everything hidden unless you listening with your conscience
Taking revisiting lyrics to feel the content
German precision sniffers is ill-equipped for this bomb threat
This shit could get too thick for Shawshank
Don't bank on lip if you can't swim or walk it
Didn't got the whisky on the arm rest
Puffing something stinky from the tropics
With a face like, brake lights
Ey son you can miss me with the nonsense

Uh, See times and people change but numbers don't

We made dough without flour ekasi, it's where I rose

I've been down for the streets, and now it picks me up

You see they add a lot of problems when they minus-ing us
They must, do the math from the previous lines
Selling gold was contagious, now I got that midas touch, that's right
We survive when they told us we're never winning in this
Patience on my timeframe till I could picture this, ha
Y'all still drink ciders and pee 'em like evenings
With that much flow, I could beat the odds when I even things
And be the voice of the illest
Shit, I can flow so the industry pour my thoughts on a jiggy beat
Either or, I'm a lyricist

Get applause in the millions, 'till I'm gone they be feeling this

Gotta watch my back to see these niggas got it fucked up
But I keep my heater on me daily, nigga, what's up? You're fucked up
Then put G-Cell with the .9 Nina
Releasin' vapors on that ass like Biz
This like not misdemeanor (Nuh-huh)
So take notes, I slit throats up of a rhyme biter
Bump your bitch
Just spliff her on 'em all nighter
Gangsta haters
Can't stand to see me comin'
With this TEC-9 creepin', nigga, and straight up dumpin'
Now let's roll
Until you lose control
Steady reachin' for the sky, watch this game unfold
For this real Eastside Rida man, it's all about that cheddar
Tryin' to live my life better
Tryin' to buy them fly sweaters
Throw the Macs in the cut
Keep it right, keep it strong tight
Never lose my head as I be dead, keep my game right
In the city there's no pity
So I exercise my game
Better watch your front 'cause I be back
Crippin' it up again

Lord have mercy on a young black
I shoot up shit with the TEC then where my pride at?
My will is empty all I do is 'pose I'm daydreamin'
I've seen it all but couldn't tell you what life mean
What's my purpose?
Once I sit, hittin' and hurt and suffer
I show no love for these
Busta-ass motherfuckers
Convicted felon criminal minded that can't get a job
So when I'mma hungry do I starve to death or [?] robs
Oh my God
I only call on You when I need ya
You know a nigga get you high back before he feature
The only child runnin' wild still on parole
I got a son he don't know me
And he's 4 years old
Sadness and madness, this hurt me in the worst ways
The jury say I missed all my son birthdays
Moment of silence means quiet on the fuckin' set
Lord, please, don't let my son walk my footsteps
He couldn't handle it
He see too many crucifies
Plus, he got to be proud of his friends high and close his eyes
And bless his momma, she's a money hungry lyin' rat
Didn't mean to call her that
But, damn, that's how the FUCK she act
I've been locked down for three long whole summers
Fuck the block they takes the motherfuckin' phone number
I'm needin' help but can't did it from a damned soul
But the homie
And they just gave him life without parole
Lord have mercy
[BIG FREEZE]
For sure when I bust verbally
[?], label me a threat to society
Maybe it's because I spit with force
Or I'm too
Underground of being seen in their Source, Magazine
But well of course I take one of those AK machine fullies
With the 15 round clip and an infrared beam
Crime scene
Known fellas, death strugglers
A gang that's representer by players, killers and hustlers, now bustas
Get beat down, stomped out and jacked
Act anybody and they tell you Watts niggas it's like that, in fact
I don't know no more niggas like my niggas old schools squads
Rhyme besides the robbers with the
50 caliber
Semi-automatics can't stop
Refused to quit, we gotta let these busters have it
Tragically seem shattered dreams and infrared beams
Screamin' breakin' the demons
Tryna stake by all means
And I know I'mma have to pop just to protect my turf
Or be a bitch and tryna creep and wind up in a hearse
Oh no, not Freeze, I keeps it real, no fakin'
'Cause the hood is for death, loc
I just can't shake this is talent
We was raised by G's
From the good old days
Laced with this gangsterism just playin' these cold ways
How crime pays and fully K's mean power
Trippin' a few on island? in that ass some lead shower
And that adds up the mo' death
Mo' tape empty shells and my soul might burn in Hell
I can't tell you to outcome 'cause I don't know
But one thing I know for sure was everybody gots to go

It's a time to buy, a time for shopping
Going to the store and make a choice
But everything she sees, it's like they're talking
Talking at her with a different voice

[Verse 1]
Laura's head is buzzing, can't remember what she came here for
Couldn't keep her promise not to gaze at things she can't afford
'Cause there's shoes, bags and silk scarves and dreams of summer days
And now she's wording a letter to her bosses for a raise

[Pre-Chorus]
But then she passes the baby section
With the tiniest shoes on shiny trays

[Chorus]
It's a time to buy, a time for shopping
Going to the store and make a choice
But everything she sees, it's like they're talking
Talking at her with their different voices
A singer's voice and her mother's pleas
And the voice of countless charities
But the one she heeds with certainty says
""Have it all
Have it all
Have it all""

I came from Africa, crazy massacre
Cheeks in the front of the whip and back of the
Navy Acura, Played ambassador
Of this rap game, no baby stamina
Grown up Swag
Fill the Ozone with blown up Grass
You ain't got money better loan up cash
Dope ass beats and the flows not bad
Better blow up SHAQ
Cause you need a baller team
Your chick short, men you need a taller queen
My sh** wicked when I hit the mall I'm mean
Big chains and my whips it's all a dream
Just like biggie track
When I come through it's like EZ Pass
Get funk flex I'm a hit VLAD
Rap insight good gift to have
Let's twist a cap
Of that cold drink
Put it on the house now the hoes wink
Hoodie Pitch black ni**** no pink
Weed every where so the clothes stink
Headphones banging from the beats by Dre
Talk green white green when I see Wale
Down south money like T.I. plate
You could get murked over freestyle craze
Every week valet
I push the whip she cook the dish
Cats on the highways - that's puss at risk
Keep your pets cause I'm running 'em over
So much tracks for you song promoters
So much roc I belong to HOVA
F**king cheap skates bubble gum or soda
If you need beef you could come to Kroger
Just like burger king I server them thangs!
These Ni**** can't hold me back
Above the law like I'm police hat
Big boi like I know three stacks
Suck my dick get on both knee caps
Turn that off, it's like totally crap
Doctor Drew you need to go to rehab
Come to my show and get a photo need pass
Twitter tweet you need to follow me back/
Pussy Hoe L.A. to Jersey Snooki show!
Make it rain as the booty goes
Making me cum it's gooey gross
Then I act cold like I'm 2 below
Don't see nothing but the jewelry glow!
Bang that west till I'm through with east coast
Bang that west till I'm through with east coast uh!

They're angry as f**k I'm raging too
Dress code red, I'm a stay in blue
West Africa child, that's the way I grew
Married to the game I say I do
You don't wanna see stuff that the KY do
Cash rules everything play out WU
I'm heavy in the game I weigh out you!
Finger snapping let me spin it back 'n

Make more hits than a tennis racket
Landlord flow for you tenant rappers
Wrap it up good I'm a sell it after
Kris Kross over  Rick Ross, twist yours that's denim backwards
I leave hotels with a smelling mattress
These ni**** can't hold me back,  no Pun intended no Joey Crack

K-mel,Blowin’ in the Wind,"5 ContributorsEastward Ho ~  Prologue  & Act 2. Scene 2 LyricsBefore  SECURITY'S  House.
Enter  SECURITY,  solus.
Sec.
My privy guest, lusty Quicksilver, has drunk too deep of the bride-bowl; but, with a little sleep, he is much recovered; and, I think, is making himself ready to be drunk in a gallanter likeness. My house is as 't were the cave where the young outlaw hoards the stolen vails of his occupation; and here, when he will revel it in his prodigal similitude, he retires to his trunks, and (I may say softly) his punks: he dares trust me with the keeping of both; for I am security itself; my name is Security, the famous usurer.

Enter  QUICKSILVER  in his prentice's coat and cap, his gallant breeches and stockings, gartering himself.
Quick.
Come, old Security, thou father of destruction! th' indented sheepskin is burn'd wherein I was wrapp'd; and I am now loose, to get more children of perdition into thy usurous bonds. Thou feed'st my lechery, and I thy covetousness; thou art pander to me for my wench, and I to thee for thy cozenages. K. me, K. thee runs through court and country.

Sec.
Well said, my subtle Quicksilver! These K's ope the doors to all this world's felicity; the dullest forehead sees it. Let not Master Courtier think he carries all the knavery on his shoulders: I have known poor Hob in the country, that has worn hobnails on 's shoes, have as much villainy in 's head as he that wears gold buttons in 's cap.

Quick.
Why, man, 't is the London highway to thrift; if virtue be us'd, 't is but as a scrap to the net of villainy. They that use it simply, thrive simply, I warrant. Weight and fashion makes goldsmiths cuckolds.
Enter  SINDEFY,  with  QUICKSILVER'S  doublet, cloak, rapier, and dagger.
Sin.
Here, sir, put off the other half of your prenticeship.

Quick.
Well said, sweet Sin. Bring forth my bravery.
Now let my trunks shoot forth their silks conceal'd;
I now am free, and now will justify
My trunks and punks. Avaunt, dull flat cap, then!
Via,  the curtain that shadowed Borgia!
There lie, thou husk of my envassall'd state;
I, Samson, now have burst the Philistines' bands,
And in thy lap, my lovely Dalila,
I'll lie and snore out my enfranchis'd state.
[ Singing ]When Samson was a tall young man,
His power and strength increased than;
He sold no more nor cup nor can;
But did them all despise.
Old Touchstone, now write to thy friends
For one to sell thy base gold ends;
Quicksilver now no more attends
Thee, Touchstone.But, dad, hast thou seen my running gelding dress'd to-day?
Sec.
That I have, Frank. The ostler a' th' Cock dressed him for a breakfast.

Quick.
What, did he eat him?

Sec.
No, but he ate his breakfast for dressing him; and so dress'd him for breakfast.

Quick.
O witty age! where age is young in wit,
And all youths' words have graybeards full of it!
Sin.
But alas, Frank! how will all this be maintain'd now? Your place maintain'd it before.

Quick.
Why, and I maintain'd my place. I'll to the court: another manner of place for maintenance, I hope, than the silly city. I heard my father say, I heard my mother sing an old song and a true: ""Thou art a she fool, and know'st not what belongs to our male wisdom."" I shall be a merchant, forsooth! trust my estate in a wooden trough as he does? What are these ships but tennis balls for the winds to play withal? — toss'd from one wave to another; now under-line, now over the house; sometimes brick-wall'd against a rock, so that the guts fly out again; sometimes struck under the wide hazard, and farewell, Master Merchant.

Sin.
Well, Frank, well: the seas, you say, are uncertain: but he that sails in your court seas shall find 'em ten times fuller of hazard; wherein to see what is to be seen is torment more than a free spirit can endure; but, when you come to suffer, how many injuries swallow you! What care and devotion must you use to humor an imperious lord, proportion your looks to his looks, smiles to his smiles; fit your sails to the winds of his breath!

Quick.
Tush! he's no journeyman in his craft that cannot do that.

Sin.
But he's worse then a prentice that does it, not only humoring the lord, but every trencher-bearer, every groom that by indulgence and intelligence crept into his favor, and by panderism into his chamber. He rules the roast; and, when my honorable Lord says it shall be thus, my worshipful rascal, the groom of his close-stool, says it shall not be thus, claps the door after him, and who dares enter? A prentice, quoth you? 'T is but to learn to live; and does that disgrace a man? He that rises hardly, stands firmly; but he that rises with ease, alas, falls as easily.
Quick.
A pox on you! who taught you this morality?

Sec.
'T is 'long of this witty age, Master Francis. But, indeed, Mistress Sindefy, all trades complain of inconvenience, and therefore 't is best to have none. The merchant, he complains and says, ""Traffic is subject to much uncertainty and loss."" Let 'em keep their goods on dry land, with a vengeance, and not expose other men's substances to the mercy of the winds, under protection of a wooden wall, as Master Francis says; and all for greedy desire to enrich themselves with unconscionable gain, two for one, or so; where I, and such other honest men as live by lending money, are content with moderate profit, thirty or forty i' th' hundred, so we may have it with quietness, and out of peril of wind and weather, rather than run those dangerous courses of trading, as they do.

Quick.
Ay, dad, thou mayst well be called Security, for thou takest the safest course.

Sec.
Faith, the quieter, and the more contented, and, out of doubt, the more godly; for merchants, in their courses, are never pleas'd, but ever repining against Heaven: one prays for a westerly wind, to carry his ship forth; another for an easterly, to bring his ship home; and, at every shaking of a leaf, he falls into an agony, to think what danger his ship is in on such a coast, and so forth. The farmer, he is ever at odds with the weather: sometimes the clouds have been too barren; sometimes the heavens forget themselves. Their harvests answer not their hopes: sometimes the season falls out too fruitful, corn will bear no price, and so forth. Th' artificer, he's all for a stirring world: if his trade be too dull, and fall short of his expectation, then falls he out of joint. Where we that trade nothing but money are free from all this; we are pleas'd with all weathers. Let it rain or hold up, be calm or windy, let the season be whatsoever, let trade go how it will, we take all in good part, e'en what please the Heavens to send us, so the sun stand not still and the moon keep her usual returns, and make up days, months, and years.

Quick.
And you have good security!
Sec.
Ay, marry, Frank, that's the special point.

Quick.
And yet, forsooth, we must have trades to live withal; for we cannot stand without legs, nor fly without wings, and a number of such scurvy phrases. No, I say still, he that has wit, let him live by his wit; he that has none, let him be a tradesman.

Sec.
Witty Master Francis! 'T is pity any trade should dull that quick brain of yours. Do but bring knight Petronel into my parchment toils once, and you shall never need to toil in any trade, a' my credit. You know his wife's land?

Quick.
Even to a foot, sir; I have been often there: a pretty fine seat, good land, all entire within itself.
Sec.
Well wooded?

Quick.
Two hundred pounds' worth of wood ready to fell. And a fine sweet house, that stands just in the midst an 't, like a prick in the midst of a circle; would I were your farmer, for a hundred pound a year!

Sec.
Excellent Master Francis! how I do long to do thee good! How I do hunger and thirst to have the honor to enrich thee! Ay, even to die, that thou mightest inherit my living; even hunger and thirst! For, a' my religion, Master Francis — and so tell knight Petronel — I do it to do him a pleasure.

Quick.
Marry, dad, his horses are now coming up to bear down his lady; wilt thou lend him thy stable to set 'em in?

Sec.
Faith, Master Francis, I would be loth to lend my stable out of doors; in a greater matter I will pleasure him, but not in this.

Quick.
A pox of your hunger and thirst! Well, dad, let him have money; all he could anyway get is bestowed on a ship now bound for Virginia; the frame of which voyage is so closely convey'd that his new lady nor any of her friends know it. Notwithstanding, as soon as his lady's hand is gotten to the sale of her inheritance, and you have furnish'd him with money, he will instantly hoist sail and away.

Sec.
Now a frank gale of wind go with him, Master Frank! we have too few such knight adventurers! Who would not sell away competent certainties to purchase, with any danger, excellent uncertainties? Your true knight venturer ever does it. Let his wife seal to-day; he shall have his money to-day.

Quick.
To-morrow she shall, dad, before she goes into the country; to work her to which action with the more engines, I purpose presently to prefer my sweet Sin here to the place of her gentlewoman; whom you, for the more credit, shall present as your friend's daughter, a gentlewoman of the country, new come up with a will for awhile to learn fashions forsooth, and be toward some lady; and she shall buzz pretty devices into her lady's ear; feeding her humors so serviceably, as the manner of such as she is, you know —

Sec.
True, good Master Francis.

Quick.
That she shall keep her port open to anything she commends to her.

Sec.
A' my religion, a most fashionable project; as good she spoil the lady, as the lady spoil her; for 't is three to one of one side. — Sweet Mistress Sin, how are you bound to Master Francis! I do not doubt to see you shortly wed one of the head men of our city.

Sin.
But, sweet Frank, when shall my father Security present me?

Quick.
With all festination; I have broken the ice to it already; and will presently to the knight's house, whither, my good old dad, let me pray thee, with all formality to man her.

Sec.
Command me, Master Francis; I do hunger and thirst to do thee service! — Come, sweet Mistress Sin, take leave of my Winifred, and we will instantly meet frank Master Francis at your lady's.


Enter  WINIFRED  above.
Win.
Where is my Cu there? Cu?

Sec.
Ay, Winnie.

Win.
Wilt thou come in, sweet Cu?

Sec.
Ay, Winnie, presently.

Exeunt  all but  QUICKSILVER.


Quick.
""Ay, Winnie,"" quod he. That's all he can do, poor man; he may well cut off her name at ""Winnie."" Oh, 't is an egregious pander! What will not an usurous knave be, so he may be rich? Oh, 't is a notable Jews' trump! I hope to live to see dogs' meat made of the old usurer's flesh, dice of his bones, and indentures of his skin; and yet his skin is too thick to make parchment; 't would make good boots for a peterman to catch salmon in. Your only smooth skin to make fine vellum is your Puritan's skin; they be the smoothest and slickest knaves in a country.
Enter  SIR PETRONEL,  in boots, with a riding-wand.
Pet.
I'll out of this wicked town as fast as my horse can trot! Here's now no good action for a man to spend his time in. Taverns grow dead; ordinaries are blown up; plays are at a stand; houses of hospitality at a fall; not a feather waving, nor a spur jingling anywhere. I'll away instantly.

Quick.
Y'ad best take some crowns in your purse, knight, or else your Eastward Castle will smoke but miserably.

Pet.
Oh, Frank! my castle? Alas! all the castles I have are built with air, thou know'st.
Quick.
I know it, knight, and therefore wonder whither your lady is going.

Pet.
Faith, to seek her fortune, I think. I said I had a castle and land eastward, and eastward she will, without contradiction; her coach and the coach of the sun must meet full butt. And, the sun being outshined with her Ladyship's glory, she fears he goes westward to hang himself.

Quick.
And I fear, when her enchanted castle becomes invisible, her Ladyship will return and follow his example.

Pet.
Oh, that she would have the grace! for I shall never be able to pacify her, when she sees herself deceived so.

Quick.
As easily as can be. Tell her she mistook your directions, and that shortly yourself will down with her to approve it; and then clothe but her crupper in a new gown, and you may drive her any way you list. For these women, sir, are like Essex calves: you must wriggle 'em on by the tail still, or they will never drive orderly.

Pet.
But, alas, sweet Frank! thou know'st my ability will not furnish her blood with those costly humors.

Quick.
Cast that cost on me, sir. I have spoken to my old pander, Security, for money or commodity; if you will, I know he will procure you.

Pet.
Commodity! Alas! what commodity?

Quick.
Why, sir, what say you to figs and raisins?

Pet.
A plague of figs and raisins, and all such frail commodities! We shall make nothing of 'em.

Quick.
Why then, sir, what say you to forty pound in roasted beef?

Pet.
Out upon't. I have less stomach to that than to the figs and raisins. I'll out of town, though I sojourn with a friend of mine; for stay here I must not: my creditors have laid to arrest me, and I have no friend under heaven but my sword to bail me.

Quick.
God's me, knight, put 'em in sufficient sureties, rather than let your sword bail you! Let 'em take their choice, either the King's Bench or the Fleet, or which of the two Counters they like best, for, by the Lord, I like none of 'em.

Pet.
Well, Frank, there is no jesting with my earnest necessity; thou know'st if I make not present money to further my voyage begun, all's lost, and all I have laid out about it.

Quick.
Why, then, sir, in earnest; if you can get your wise lady to set her hand to the sale of her inheritance, the bloodhound, Security, will smell out ready money for you instantly.

Pet.
There spake an angel: to bring her to which conformity, I must fain myself extremely amorous; and, alleging urgent excuses for my stay behind, part with her as passionately as she would from her foisting hound.

Quick.
You have the sow by the right ear, sir. I warrant there was never child long'd more to ride a cockhorse or wear his new coat than she longs to ride in her new coach. She would long for everything when she was a maid, and now she will run mad for 'em. I lay my life, she will have every year four children; and what charge and change of humor you must endure while she is with child, and how she will tie you to your tackling till she be with child, a dog would not endure. Nay, there is no turnspit dog bound to his wheel more servilely than you shall be to her wheel; for, as that dog can never climb the top of his wheel but when the top comes under him, so shall you never climb the top of her contentment but when she is under you.

Pet.
'Slight, how thou terrifiest me!

Quick.
Nay, hark you, sir; what nurses, what midwives, what fools, what physicians, what cunning women must be sought for (fearing sometimes she is bewitch'd, sometimes in a consumption), to tell her tales, to talk bawdy to her, to make her laugh, to give her glisters, to let her blood under the tongue and betwixt the toes; how she will revile and kiss you, spit in your face, and lick it off again; how she will vaunt you are her creature; she made you of nothing; how she could have had thousand-mark jointures; she could have been made a lady by a Scotch knight, and never ha' married him; she could have had panadas in her bed every morning; how she set you up, and how she will pull you down — you'll never be able to stand of your legs to endure it.

Pet.
Out of my fortune! what a death is my life bound face to face to! The best is, a large time-fitted conscience is bound to nothing: marriage is but a form in the school of policy, to which scholars sit fast'ned only with painted chains. Old Security's young wife is ne'er the further off with me.

Quick.
Thereby lies a tale, sir. The old usurer will be here instantly, with my punk Sindefy, whom you know your lady has promis'd me to entertain for her gentlewoman; and he, with a purpose to feed on you, invites you most solemnly by me to supper.

Pet.
It falls out excellently fitly; I see desire of gain makes jealously venturous.

Enter  GERTRUDE.

See, Frank, here comes my lady. Lord, how she views thee! She knows thee not, I think, in this bravery.

Ger.
How now? who be you, I pray?

Quick.
One Master Francis Quicksilver, an 't please your Ladyship.

Ger.
[ aside ] God's my dignity! as I am a lady, if he did not make me blush so that mine eyes stood a-water. Would I were unmarried again!—


Enter  SECURITY  and  SINDEFY.


Where's my woman, I pray?

Quick.
See, madam, she now comes to attend you.

Sec.
God save my honorable knight and his worshipful lady!

Ger.
Y' are very welcome; you must not put on your hat yet.

Sec.
No, madam; till I know your Ladyship's further pleasure, I will not presume.

Ger.
And is this a gentleman's daughter new come out of the country?

Sec.
She is, madam; and one that her father hath a special care to bestow in some honorable lady's service, to put her out of her honest humors, forsooth; for she had a great desire to be a nun, an 't please you.

Ger.
A nun? what nun? a nun substantive? or a nun adjective?

Sec.
A nun substantive, madam, I hope if a nun be a noun. But, I mean, lady, a vow'd maid of that order.

Ger.
I'll teach her to be a maid of the order, I warrant you. And can you do any work belongs to a lady's chamber?

Sin.
What I cannot do, madam, I would be glad to learn.

Ger.
Well said! Hold up, then; hold up your head, I say; come hither a little.

Sin.
I thank your Ladyship.

Ger.
And hark you — good man, you may put on your hat now; I do not look on you — I must have you of my faction now; not of my knight's, maid.

Sin.
No, forsooth, Madam, of yours.

Ger.
And draw all my servants in my bow, and keep my counsel, and tell me tales, and put me riddles, and read on a book sometimes when I am busy, and laugh at country gentlewomen, and command anything in the house for my retainers; and care not what you spend, for it is all mine; and, in any case, be still a maid, whatsoever you do, or whatsoever any man can do unto you.

Sec.
I warrant your Ladyship for that.

Ger.
Very well; you shall ride in my coach with me into the country, to-morrow morning. — Come, knight, pray thee let's make a short supper, and to bed presently.

Sec.
Nay, good madam, this night I have a short supper at home waits on his Worship's acceptation.

Ger.
By my faith, but he shall not go, sir; I shall swoon an he sup from me.

Pet.
Pray thee, forbear; shall he lose his provision?

Ger.
Ay, by'r Lady, sir, rather than I lose my longing. Come in, I say; as I am a lady, you shall not go.

Quick.
[ aside ] I told him what a burr he had gotten.

Sec.
If you will not sup from your knight, madam, let me entreat your Ladyship to sup at my house with him.

Ger.
No, by my faith, sir; then we cannot be abed soon enough after supper.

Pet.
[ aside ] What a med'cine is this! — Well, Master Security, you are new married as well as I; I hope you are bound as well. We must honor our young wives, you know.

Quick.
[ aside to  SECURITY] In policy, dad, till to-morrow she has seal'd.

Sec.
I hope in the morning yet your Knighthood will breakfast with me.

Pet.
As early as you will, sir.

Sec.
Thank your good Worship; I do hunger and thirst to do you good, sir!

Ger.
Come, sweet knight, come; I do hunger and thirst to be abed with thee!

Akela baitha kar raha tha intzaar mai
Kuch arsay pehle ki baat bta raha hun yaar mai
Hotel mai milna tha nazar meri ghari (watch) pe jami
Aur akhir tu agae puri hui teri kami
Uth kr khada hua agey tere ki kursi (chair)
Aur bola tum betho ispe, mere liye dusri
Nazar thi tujhpe meri soch mai kya baat krun
Kis tarhah shuru krun, kis tarah shuruwaat krun
Table pe Ashtray aur pada dabba cigarette ka
Pee raha aur bhool gaya k kamzoor hun mai dil ka
Hath pakar k boli J.J lamha hai mushkil ka
Choro gey kabhi nahi, wada kro abhi zara
Har baat teri, mujhe yaad hai
Abhi bhi lage, tu sath hai
Waqt k sath sath ik duje ko bhool gae
Yun lagey jesey hum dono kal hi thay school gae!

Waiting, anticipating
For your love to shine on me
Dating! in my mind
I see both of us unwind, as I get behind
You might also like[Verse 2: Shag]

Living my life is a lesson in itself
A curse so perverse, it's a blessing in itself
The paths I walk on, are seldom full of light
In the depths of darkness, deep in the night
Puffing on the lye, because there's something on my mind
Cerebral assassins, hunting down my rhymes
It's 4 in the morning, I'm looking at the time
The clock seems to stop in the middle of the night
Only thing I'm feeling is the sound of the beat
Seeing flashbacks, defeated! - down on my knees!
Trials and tribulations, happiness, sorrows
Fading in the air as I empty up this bottle
Scribbling in my notepad, spitting out my heart
Dreaming about fantasies, reaching for the stars
Looking in my soul, to find the meaning of my art
Every verse, Every bar - I'm fiending for applause!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Mani] [Punjabi]

Yaran naal behta me teri gal bat karan
Gal bat vich bas eko shurowat karan
Lafzan vich bas tere pyar nu beyaan karan jan khawan heer khawan

Door behta jj mere kholo gal pochda way
Mani teri ankhan vich tera pyar disda
Han kasme khuda di me te oono pyar karda
Me dhup vich chaun keedi odhe uthay marda
Oo pal menu yad ne bas tere hey kiyal ne
Kiyaalan vich teriyan o meriyan o sariyan khaniyan
Diwaani han tu kehendi c me teri han

[Verse 4: Sharaf Qaisar]

Redesign, redefine, reassign, realign
Looking at the world through my window blind
All I need is to get high
And then have a plane stand by
Mile high club you while we land in Dubai!
Go to China Town we do it like Shanghai!
Maybe go to India we do it in Mumbai
I got a great plane and you need to test fly
Cuff you until you give in to me, FBI!
WE could try outdoor do it under the blue sky
Letcha feel the Heat of the moment, let's french fry!
Of course I have some rules and you need to comply
I'll be your cheese, you be my pizza pie
Now baby don't be too shy
Wear nothing but just a tie and then
Let me bite your inner thigh
You know I ain't a good guy, so I'll be the bad guy
Leave you breathless, bone dry - after that its GOOD BYE!

Drinking out the bottle and surrounded by them mommies

Cause people they never around when you ain’t got none
But after the riches they be sending accounts

K-mel,Call Off the Search,"8 ContributorsCall Off the Search Lyrics[Verse 1]
I won't spend my life, waiting for an angel to descend
Searching for a rainbow with an end

[Refrain]
Now that I've found you
I'll call off the search

[Verse 2]
And I won't spend my life gazing at the stars up in the sky
Wondering if love will pass me by

[Refrain]
Now that I've found you
I'll call off the search

[Bridge]
Out on my own I would never have known
This world that I see today
And I've got a feeling
It won't fade away

[Verse 3]
And I won't end my days wishing that love would come along
'Cause you are in my life where you belong

K-mel,Crawling Up a Hill,"3 ContributorsLost Silver vs Creepy Black (Poképasta Battle Royale) Lyrics[Intro]
EPIC RAP BATTLES OF POKEMON
CREEPY BLACK
VS
LOST SILVER
BEGIN!

[Verse 1: Lost Silver]
I'M DEAD, I want to live to spit this curse at you
Turn back now or you'll be sent to your doom
Cyndaquil says ""HURRY"" 'cause this GHOST will be Unown
I'll leave you in chains like the Pokémon I own
The forgotten hero haunts this spawn of Lavender Town
This is the battle of your life. The run option's not allowed
LEAVE, or it'll be your soul that I pilfer
In this battle of horrors, you'll take second place silver

[Verse 2: Creepy Black]
Black's here to hack through your silver soul and brain
You think you'll win? Man, the word ""Lost"" is in your name
GHOST is in your party, the Lavender Town sprite spirit
I'll curse you first, even though in Generation 1, that move wasn't in it
You can't stеp to me. Hell, you can't step at all
Can't catch this brawling ghost insidе a Pokéball
You're too scared to move. You're about to get owned
And on the place I finish you off, there'll stand a tombstone
You might also like[Verse 3: Lost Silver]
NOMORE, Your raps are giving me FRUSTRATION
You can't K.O. me! This will be my domination
Celebi will sing a Perish Song and have our Pain Split
Your data will be erased! REST IN 8 BITS

[Verse 4: Creepy Black]
Don't be giving me that Mean Look, or I'll use my Curse ability
You're Lost, Silver, when you come up against me
I murder every trainer I face. Don't even bother to fight
It's time to put you to sleep, 'cause this is your very last night

[Verse 5: BRVR]
Do you love me? If not, I'll use my thunderbolt
I know you'll never leave once I catch your souls
It's so cold down here, but my rhymes are so hot
Like what my owner did to me, I'll leave you all to ROT
You don't know the pain that's going in my chest
All of you were lying to me when you said your disses were the best
I'd rather die than listen to your lame excuses of raps
When you see my plushy in the room, it'll end in a BLOODBATH

[Verse 6: Buried Alive]
Let me come out from the ground and make you stop your strife
My time to shine and finally rip apart your lives
It's over, Pikachu, Nowhere to run and nowhere to hide
'Cause all you flee in fright when BURIEDALIVE wants to fight
Won't be tame when I've glitched your game, you're lame, will never be saved
'Cause my claim to fame: taking jokes like you to your graves
Finally, fresh meat, I've been waiting almost a century
You've reached the final floor! Now it's time to get BURIED
[Verse 7: Missingno.]
The true killer king has arrived to break your demise
No one will be missing you when I make you all di-I-I-I-I-I-I-e
Your pants, you'll be splitting when Missingno.'s spitting
These lyrics were written in the blood that's dripping
From your quitting, barely living heads since I'm hitting and ripping
There's missing-no way you'll win versus this verbal ass-kicking
Time's ticking, and ticking, and I'm winning, and grinning
I'm the glitching killing forbidden beginning of your spine-splitti-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-ing

[Verse 8: Strangled Red]
I have no reason to be here, but I'll take you all down anyways
You guys thinking you're the best has driven me even more crazed
In a world that cheated me, why should I play fair?
Just like me when Miki died, you'll all be driven to despair
I'll kill you all, I'm gonna do it, you don't wanna know what's going in my mind
This win is MINE, your guys' victory is something you can't find
Nothing can be saved now, prepare your necks, I'll strangle you all, there won't be a reset
When you step up to me, you'll end up dead, with the last thing you see is the color of red

[Verse 9: White Hand]
I can't believe you think that you all understand
You're nothing, but at least now you're in my hand
Crashing through this battle, rapping 'till you faint from this happening
Taking over your game 'cause your bodies aren't the only thing I'm hacking
Trust me, you'll be missing with no one to find the remains
All of you are fighting for supremacy, but your rapping's the same
Make all the noises you want. It'll prove to be futile
When I rip you into pieces, you'll know I made this battle BRUTAL
[Verse 10: Hypno's Lullaby]
Come with me, little children, Safe and happy you'll all be
As you rest in your beds and I DEVOUR ALL YOUR DREAMS
Don't cry, it's fine. Hypno wouldn't hurt a fly
Fortunately, all of you are NON-INVERTEBRATE SLIME
Got to Hand it to you, White. At least you proved you aren't the worst
Because Missingno. blew for every second of his verse
Hypno lied to you all. Sorry, now you're dead and done
Stay with me forever, we'll have so much fun

[Verse 11: Lavender Town Syndrome]
Come and listen to my song, I'll make all your ears bleed
You'll all be suicidal in this battle, don't believe me?
Step out of the cave, into the town and feel my power
More fearsome than the ghost of Marowak who haunts this tower
Any child who plays with me will end up being dead and severed
I'll corrupt all of you, showing you who should be feared
You think you're scary? I've got zombie Pokémon on my side
Challenging me to a battle? Better get ready to hide

[Verse 12: Ash's Coma]
I leave my home, start my journey all alone
No...(I'll catch 'em all) No... (Number one) I'll leave YOU all in a coma
Your theories aren't eerie. They're ethereal diseases
I'm the leader, and I'll turn you into Ash for your treason
(Listen!) My vision's blurry...(Stop! Pikachu!) I can't see...
I thought we were all a team. Maybe this is just a dream
Your existence is fiction. You'd rather hurt than feel hurting
Time to show you what I've learned on my Pokémon journey
Stage 1: Strike you with a bolt of lightning in my pocket
(Pikachu!) Stage 2: Ignite your fire and blast you like Team Rocket
Stage 3: Water Gun you down with flows you can't test
Stage 4: Make new friends and become the very best
If this is all in my head, sprawled in a hospital bed
Then I'm forever indebted to recycle the REM
Come on, You pasta peoples can't quite catch up!
Well, this battle is done, so let me pull the plug

[Outro]
Who Won?
Who's Next?
You decide...

Anladın mı lan demir gibi sert çete
Biz bizi biliriz al sana reçete
Hassiktir dost geçinene kolpa

Ota boka trip yapar aklı 2pac'ta
Sen evinde korkarken ben ise Pac'la

Fuck you, fuck your clique, fuck your momma, I raped your bitch
Fuck with me, get your ass popped trying to fuck with Screech

While she rolling in the whip, life's a trip
I am a rebel
Repping Raider Klan niggas we devils
Better understand that I am the man of the land, from the Blackland all the way to Japan
B R to the K
Me and my nigga Robb be bringing the phonk no time to play
What can I say, my flow is fucking cray
Money, Power, Respect
Fucking these bitches like everyday
[Bridge: Robb Bank$]
And I don't fuck with the plugs from out of town
I only move work back home
And take my keys go fill my prescription
If that's my connect don't answer the phone, no no, no
I tell em' I ain't on that
RIP Lil Phat
In his memory bring it back

[Chorus: SpaceGhostPurrp]
Like Beyonce, like Trina
Like a big booty ass black Diva
Like a light Skin Diamond
Or like KDia
They know, let me see that from the back
Like that, like that, bounce that ass like that
Like that, bend over let me see it from the back
Like that, like that, pop that pussy like that
We don't fuck with the other side, so we straight like that

K-mel,Dirty Dice,"4 Contributors1632 Lyrics[Verse 1]
I remember it was hard in the pits with my dawgs
Made it out with scars, that's a kiss from the gods
Gold drip on my wrist look like piss on my arm
My pinky ring bling make you ring your alarm
Know some scammers with the cards who think sin is a fraud
If you let 'em in then they pimpin' your broad
Money make them spin like the rims on a car
For the money, kill your kin leavin' skin in the tar
You not rich if you trip over tips at bar
You rich if your kids kids kids got a farm
A bitch nigga chin needs a fist not a palm
When you niggas RIP you not missed where you from
And when you dead and gone they might sing you a song
Did your mama wrong, she can't bring you along
Now she missing your charm
Calm while you trimming her lawn
At Avalon and she is picking your plants (Hela heh)
Majita  ba ko Ivory can strip a car quick
His girl works at XO, the strippers arе thick
I went with my chick and she was all on my stick
In my ear said shе wish that she could swallow my kids
Never sleep with a girl you wouldn't father life with
A couple bones from my father gave my daughter my ribs
Pause, nigga really hard but they ain't hard as my clique
Spliffing with Zoocci so pardon my Piff
Amakhosi or a Pirate?
Amadlozi are not silent
In the land of the violence
In the sand we get diamonds
And every man is an island

Mandisa from Mashemong in Tembisa
Worked at her mama saloon in Mambisa
O pila, wa fisa
Jitas ba brika ha fithla
Ba mo bitsa ha ba bona a jika, eh

Do anything for di klippa
Only if you tipped her, sister never been a sthipha
Could've been a cook, lost her life to di thipa
By a landslide storms turned my soil into mud
Boiling the spud turned my oil into blood
My cousin went to jail just for foiling these drugs
Poisoned his guts now it's spoiling the love
But cav', thugs be avoidin' the hugs
They tryna fill that void and they judged
The slugs in my gums turned my voice to a flood

Saw the kasi life / Rich kids blowing money
Drinking out the bottle and surrounded by them mommies
He wanted that life so bad , He would kill for it
Started making new friends that will lead to it
Plans didn't work out / Parents didn't help
No money to eat at home , He just wanted swagger
You gotta work for what you want / Yeah mama said it
I'm on that hustle everyday praying that i get it
Cause people they never around when you ain’t got none
But after the riches they be sending accounts

K-mel,Do They Know It’s Christmas?,"30 ContributorsRoots Lyrics[Intro: Stogie T]
Ehh, Stogie T, Zakwe, ehh
Ha!

[Verse 1: Stogie T]
Before Nelson Mandela was on money
I was folding leopards, you would swear it's origami
Wild life lessons, every death gave me life
Still-born,  so me and Christ share a likeness
None like him, no Siamese, it's all timing
You can push, hope it come out live, but this ain't the gynae
Zakwe hit me like ""Let's talk about the rhyming""
Couldn't find the heart to tell him ""that's not my vibe see""
Not when the world need a Marley
And Bob's your uncle but you worry about your country
I don't take molly, I take lil' rocksy and my daughter
Out to get chiffon dresses from the shopping complex
And I'm not trying to shop a complex
I put my shit in the music so you can find strength
It's a lil' project I built from the onset
Ordinary people baptized now that's a John Legend
Born in Tanzania, that seems far-fetched
But none of you know the world that's in my closet
I make lines speak to the heart of the darkness
Everything hidden unless you listening with your conscience
Taking revisiting lyrics to feel the content
German precision sniffers is ill-equipped for this bomb threat
This shit could get too thick for Shawshank
Don't bank on lip if you can't swim or walk it
Didn't got the whisky on the arm rest
Puffing something stinky from the tropics
With a face like, brake lights
Ey son you can miss me with the nonsense
You might also like[Hook: Jay Claude]
About that time I'ma get that money
I made mistakes, but I'm make more hunninds
'Cause now I found the roots to my sanity
Shades from my money tree, Hip Hop my daily bread
All black coupe can't see nobody
If you ain't know, better ask somebody
Glory for the pain in the booth for the new look
Nothing's been the same since fame, Haleluyah
All black coupe can't see nobody
If you ain't know, better ask somebody

[Verse 2: Zakwe]
Uh, See times and people change but numbers don't
It's real, Ng' overdose-a le skill, the weak I'm over those
We made dough without flour ekasi, it's where I rose
Ng'phuz' uTugela ne tap water that's how I switch flows
I've been down for the streets, and now it picks me up
(I spit!) Straight from the dome, see now they wanna fill me up
The time is up for you niggas if you ain't down with us
I'm moving clockwise, mang'fun' is'gubhu ng'yam' clock-a u-Wise
They recognize I'm a pops now with a gorgeous wife
I know my son is gon' shine, I bet on my daughter's life
I bought cars from songs I wrote while I was walking by
Pray anever ang'phuphi, I sleep it now with an open eye
I'skhath' as'mile baba, we gotta do better in rap
Second you every second you take the first step, ha
You Father Christmas niggas, sat on the first lap
Now I'ma run tings, my niggas first on that last lap
I take a stand mang'tshela lez' ez' oblivious

We bypass those who are biased mas' release-a
You don't buy us bring the pliers
Negative mind is easy to minus
Division of labour must now multiply
You see they add a lot of problems when they minus-ing us
They must, do the math from the previous lines
Selling gold was contagious, now I got that midas touch, that's right
We survive when they told us we're never winning in this
Patience on my timeframe till I could picture this, ha
Y'all still drink ciders and pee 'em like evenings
With that much flow, I could beat the odds when I even things
And be the voice of the illest
Shit, I can flow so the industry pour my thoughts on a jiggy beat
Either or, I'm a lyricist
I'm a boss, I'm a genius

Get applause in the millions, 'till I'm gone they be feeling this

K-mel,Fields of Gold,"20 ContributorsEverybody Documentary Lyrics[Logic]
One thing I think I'd like to say, and you could maybe even start the whole shit off with this is... I'm not sorry for making this album, and I made this album from a place in my heart of love... and I'm black and I'm proud as shit. That's the shit, that's the thing the whole world said I could never say or be or do. And I'm biracial and I love my fans. Swag. Flex. Rattpack

[Everybody Interlude]

[Logic]
C'mon! Is it going? Alright, what's up guys, This is day one of recording for the, I mean *Claps* Hey, What's up guys. Make sure you keep that last part in there of me explaining it because we're real all the time. RattPack
My studio is being built

[2nd Everybody Interlude]

[Logic, Bobby Campbell, and 6ix In The Studio]
Logic: *Tapping on glass*
Bobby Campbell: *Tapping his foot* ""What are you going to contribute?""
6ix: *Claps*

[Justin Fleischer]
That was the first song ever created in this room

[Logic]
Yeah, That's the first beat ever, damn
(To 6ix): But like, what's it like from, going to what's going to be in here from Charles Hall?

[6ix]
Oh, Nuts. It's gon- It's the come up. It's the glow up. It's what we've always wanted
You might also like[Logic]
Uh, Well the message for the music is just equality of man. Straight up. Straight up and down. 6 o'clock. When white people find out that I'm black, racist white people. They treat me on some like-and I've heard this, ""Send your ass back to Africa, or at least the half that doesn't matter."" Shit like that, that I've heard. It's like that's what I am, I'm either one or the other to these people. There's like just a handful, no more than I think like 4 songs, where I am truly discussing being biracial in America. With that being said, Those are the only times I discuss race, and it's my race. Not your race or his race or her race, It's just me being biracial and telling my story. And you might not like my story, but it's my story
You know, and then the entire rest of the album is rapped, you know, from different perspectives of a life that that dude Atom, who is being reincarnated has lived

[Logic In The Studio With Groups Of People]
There's a guy who dies in the beginning of this album and his name is Atom. Atom but like the ""first man"" right? But spelled A-T-O-M, like the atoms in our body and everything connecting us. He gets hit by a car and wakes up in a white void. And he's talking to this random guy. And the guy's like ""Life, What's it all about?"" And he's like ""What? What the fuck you talkin' about?"" He's like ""Where am I?"" Well, it turns out the random guy is actually God. Have you ever heard of this guy named Neil DeGrasse Tyson? Scientist, scientist, astrophysicist, crazy, super awesome, and I don't know how the hell I did it, but I got him to play the role of God on my album. Which is crazy

[Logic On His Couch]
I can't even believe that Neil DeGrasse Tyson is on this album. Like when I think about it, that's like the most gangster feature of all time

[Logic and Neil Recording]
Logic: So what now, what advice can you give me?
Neil: What advice can I give humanity?

[Logic And Friends In The Studio]
You guys know Big Von? He's like the radio DJ from the bay, on KMEL

[Steve Wyreman]
Oh Yeah

[Logic]
So he plays this guy named Atom

[Big Von and Logic Recording]
Big Von: Wait, wait, wait, what? Stop all the hippie shit
[Logic Explaining Concept]
This guy Atom dies and it's a whole conversation between them. And he finds out that he is about to be reincarnated. And then he finds out that not only that is he being reincarnated, but that he is everybody who has ever been reincarnated because there is only one human being. And he has been reincarnated so many times, in fact, that he is every human being that has ever existed. You know he was Jesus and all of his disciples. He was Hitler and everybody that he murdered. You know, every time he extended a hand of kindness to someone, he was doing it to himself. Every time he was extending a hand of hatred or murder to someone, he was only doing it onto himself. And it isn't until he has lived in the shoes of ever man, woman, child, race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation that he will know what it is to appreciate life and then be taken to the next plane of existence. So every time I'm rapping on the album pretty much, I'm rapping from the perspectives of one of the lives he has lived. So it's very sci-fi, but it's very real at the same time. It's weird man, it's a good one

[No I.D.]
Hip-Hop artists are tasked to not have any imagination, but to actually work in direct correlation to where they are from, who they were, and you know he has a lot of imagination

[Logic In His House]
I was actually really inspired when I read a short story that was written by a writer by the name of Andy Weir called ""The Egg."" I read it and it inspired me so much, and it's essentially the same thing, it's just my take on it. You know, it's a man who dies and is reincarnated and lives every life ever. And I thought ""wow,"" I relate to more than just one sect or one side of humanity or race being biracial. I kind of feel that. I feel kind of what what it's like to be two people. To be like a black man in a fair skinned body, if that makes any sense. So it's like wow, it's almost like living two separate lives to the public. Not to me, but to others.  They might view me as different people. I guess wow, that's crazy I never really thought of it like that

[No I.D.]
So bringing who he is into the stories that he wants to tell and having them intertwine with reality and fantasy, sci-fi, That's the difficult thing to score

[Logic]
I didn't think I was going to be able to pull it off. I mean how do you pull off that? How do you pull off an album rapping from different perspectives of a life that one man lived, who is actually everyone ever. it's just crazy, but I don't know how the hell it came together, but it did

[Hallelujah Interlude]

[Logic Outside His House]
This is so much more than just music. It's like a true personal part of my life. So, I'm getting my license, I'm doing my best to get fit and in shape, and deal with being mentally healthy and physically healthy. And dealing with my music and friends, wife, personal relationship, and dogs and everything. So I just want you guys to see as much of my life as you can see

[Logic Driving]
So yesterday, I think i was telling Mike that I had the wildest anxiety ever. In my mind I was like, I'm like ""I'm fine, I'm fine"" I don't know why but I was feeling physically weird. Not like ill or anything, just like- faint. You know kind of dizzy, kind of out of it. Very disconnected

[Fan Recognizes Logic]
Fan: Logic?
Logic: 'Sup dude?
Fan: What's going on man, how's you day?
Logic: Nice, I got an appointment. What's your name man?
Fan: Raymond
Logic: *Shakes his hand* Nice to meet you Raymond
Raymond: You have a great day
Logic: Thanks brother
[Logic]
Yeah, that's a big thing that I've been dealing with so much, which is like anxiety. A lot of people don't understand it and that's why I'm like having you document this right now because I want to invite everybody into my life like never before and I have severe anxiety and it's hard and it sucks

[Logic Making Beats]

[Logic]
It's just so crazy because I've always-like I'm on my shit you know what I mean? Like I'm on my shit and I know what I need to do and how I need to do things But then anxiety can step in and be like ""you feel up to having this meeting or this conversation or going on stage or performing or this or that, But I'm gonna fuck you up."" Like it's weird, it's crazy and so anxiety is so much more than just mental. it's a mental thing that can affect you physically and that's why when I had the biggest panic attack I ever had last year, you know just after The Incredible True Story was made, I was convinced I was going through was a physical thing. I was convinced it was something deeper like it was fucking cancer. Like, you know what I mean? Cause my body was so fucked up and um, it's not that. It's my mind. It's anxiety

[Making of Anziety]

[Lucy Rose]
When I went in the booth and I knew all of you guys were all out there listening, and I was learning it there and then on the spot, what he wanted me to sing. Damn, my legs were shaking, I was so nervous, It was the first time I sung it and I guess that’s when you really-like I realized that he's got a vision and I have to trust it because I wanted to practice it and get better at it, he comes back in and I was like I wanna know, I want to capture how you are right now when you're singing this for the first time

[Logic]
I think that's good, ah!

[Rose]
The first time in my life I have done anything like that

[Logic]
You never?

[Lucy Rose]
I'm not really sure how it goes

[Lucy Rose Back Outside]
Now listening back i really understand why he wanted to do that cause there was a vulnerability to what was captured that i don't know if that would have been the same if I had learnt it

[Logic and Lucy In The Booth]

[Logic Recording ""Anziety""]

[Logic]
Yo, making music makes me feel good man. Like when I'm here with you guys, like not to sound any type of way, a lot of that,I mean I still be feelin' weird, but a lot of it goes away. It's like I have purpose with you guys

[Logic Four Days Later]
Hold on, I'm trying to think... one sec'. Should it end with the hook? Or maybe-maybe that's not the hook. Maybe I keep going right now and then I bring the hook again... that's what I'll do, I will extend this verse...

[Records Rest Of ""Anziety""]

It's always really hard to recreate a vibe, because I was in such a zone the other night. I have to tap back into that same energy. It's gotta be the same

[Records More Of ""Anziety""]

Alright, NO NO. Can you pause it? I fucking hate technology. Pause it, pause it, pause it, pause it, pause it... alright can you run it back with the last shit i was doing? My fucking- my phone deleted all the shit. Fucking hate this shit

I think this is harder than when I did ""Gang Related.""

[Continues]

Let me hear that... Woo!

[Logic to Bart Simpson figure]
So I need you to bring it back so it sounds really good, you know? You gotta make it like, you gotta make my vocals pop, period. Like I'm going here and this breaks, like you gotta feel it in your soul. As the Engineer you need to know what you're doing. [Anziety bass boosted] You know what I'm saying? Gotta be really good

[Bobby Campbell]
I lost my job to Bart Simpson?

[Logic]
Yeah, you're fucking out bro

(Driving)
I was with No I.D. yesterday, Haden't seen him for a while. And we just had a real good talk. Man to man, shot some pool

[No I.D]
We shoot pool, and I just want it know I won 3 games today. (Camera man: he's gonna edit that out) it doesn't matter... WHEN YOU EDIT THIS JUST KNOW... 3-0

[Logic]
Just out of nowhere, then I played him my album. And he loved it

[No I.D.]
My thoughts were just by far his best work, for me

[Logic]
And I asked him to rap on it, and he said yeah

[No I.D.]
I mean, I can- I can rap

[Logic]
No I.D. is going to rap on my album. Which is like, what, that's so unheard of

[No I.D.]
I haven't really recorded a song in 20 years

[Logic]
I texted J. Cole and I was like, ""Yo, Deon's rapping on my album, No I.D.,"" and he was like ""WHAT? How the fuck did you get him to do that?"" and I thought about it, and I just asked him. ""Only you could get him to do that""

I've waited for this moment my whole life. Right now, nothing else matters. Just making music here with Deon

[Making of America]
The concept is how we're all and what's going on in the Native American community that's being ignored

[America Interlude]

[Logic]
America, so America came together, you all were there. That shit was crazy. I just found these like sample packs or like little things and like vocals and I was pressing them, and I was throwing drums on, and creating the pads

[Production of America beat]

When I create music I hear sounds. Distinct-- That's why you can hear my shit when you got to festivals or whatever. They sing all the words because it's catchy. All the sounds are catchy. First things you hear, Woo... that's the ""ohhhh "" and it goes off

You'll hear a switch up and then I'm just rapping from like a hood motherfucker and that's all he knows. And like, that's a lot of my own experience like with my brothers, and then my boy Lenny is like helping me voice this, you'll hear it

[Big Lenbo in the booth]

[Lenny]
When Logic approached me with the contributing to the song ""America"" he laid it out. He knew what he wanted so he gave me the inspiration. Told me exactly what he was going for in that part of the song

[No I.D.]
We worked on the first album, and I was the Executive Producer. And some of the first session into the album I pretty much knew he was a producer, not just a rapper. I told him ""hey, you don't really need me to produce your records, because you have your ideas. You need to you know have access to the personnel and techniques to deliver your thoughts.""

[Bobby Campbell]
The first album was 6ix and Logic, the exact same way they did it on the mixtapes. Like nothing has changed from that you know. These two guys, sitting in the house, not the big studio, not even down here, not anywhere special. Just the two of them sitting down with the laptop, a concept, and some kind of inspiration

[6ix]
What's crazy too is you know, the same process we were doing back in the day. Like , we didn't have the string players, we didn't have the vocalists with us. That's what's so crazy about it is, the process is the same, but now we get to involve actual real musicians, rather than me tryna sample a string part from another song because I can't play it. But now I can be like, we have Claire and Tom to actually play the shit

[Lenbo]
Big Von, he just gets really entertaining

[Big Von recording skits]

[Big Von]
Got Neil on the album, you know how crazy that is? Space, Time, all the good things like that.  Man, Logic has come up with the crazy story of all stories

[Logic to Damian Lemar Hudson]
So I was in Paris, with my wife, at the Louvre

[Sam Spratt]
So, it all started last summer when I get a call from Bob. And I pick up the phone, and It's three in the morning, and I say ""Bob, what's up man, what the fuck is this?"" And he's like ""I'm in Paris man, I'm at the Louvre, and I know what our album is going to be.""

[Logic]
Everybody is looking at the Mona Lisa, and I'm looking at the Mona Lisa like ""Wow, Leonardo Da Vinci painted this shit. Woah, this is crazy.""
But then I'm looking at, myself included, everyone is so focused on the Mona Lisa, I'm in this insane museum with all this beautiful statues and paintings and all different types of stuff. So I was like ""I'm gonna go look for something else"", not just focus on this. And I turn around, and as soon as I turn around I see this

This is The Wedding at Cana. It was when Jesus turned water into wine

[Sam Spratt]
I'm like ""Dude, doesn't that have like a hundred people in it?"" and he's like ""Yeah, it has like over 100 people. I don't know if we need that many, but like close. I want you to paint all of it. I want all my friends, all my family, everyone who works on this albums, people of all races, colors, creeds, sexual orientations, and genders. I wasn't it to be representative of Everybody.""

Early into the year I decided I wanted to go to Italy to get inspiration for this. I did my research online, went through Google image search, and I studied countless books about the artist himself, other artists in the period, but there's limits to that. there was something about it where I felt compelled-- I always wanted to go to Italy. if there was ever a chance, why not now?

I went to every possible church I could, I went to the museum, I saw the Caravaggio, I immersed myself in everything I've loved and researched and I brought it back and put everything into the cover

[Logic]
This is going to be my album cover

[Sam Spratt]
The album is told from a variety of perspectives, which is something Bob loves to do. Putting himself in someone else's shoes and taking on their struggles and success, trying to see things through their perspective. This album, listening to it, sonically connects you to the art. it just executes that flawlessly

[Logic] For the longest time, I just wanted to focus on the music and not talk about race or negative shit going on in the world because I wanted it to be happy and fun, and about lyricism and raw shit. I felt that i needed to make and album like this because me being black & white and feeling discriminated against by my own people, made me feel like I need to talk about everyone else who was discriminated against

I didn't wanna be like ""I'm biracial, but I look white and blah blah blah, no I'm really gonna talk about not only what's on my heart and mind, but whats on the hearts and minds of people all over the world who don't have the voice that I do

I am here with Patrick Starr in my studio. And I recruited him because he's amazing and awesome and he's a very sweet, kind person, and an amazing business man-- Or business queen. No, but honestly, he's just been so awesome and he's just such a great role model for so many people I wanted to include him as a representative for his culture and just have him on the album and album cover

[Starr]
Thank you! This is dope, so dope

[Logic]
I appreciate it, Thank you

[Patrick Starr in the booth]

[Logic]
I see good people who like to make good music and it's just that simple. Like ""Hey, do you like what I'm doing? Do you like what I stand for? Oh you like this message? you wanna come play? You wanna be a part of it? Yes or No?""

So I'm flying this woman out, from the Bahamas, where me and my wife went on our anniversary. Her name is Paula

[Paula McKeva]
Hiii, I'm Paula McKeva, all the was from [?], Bahamas. Met Bobby, known as Logic as well, in the Atlantis resort and Casino Hotel

[Logic]
We were at the bar having a few drinks and this shit was killing it

[McKeva]
I was singing Uptown Funk, so everyone was on the floor having fun

[Logic]
I was like up, and I was dancing with like all these older ladies and shit. It was like so fun

But like she KILLED it. Her voice was like killing it. She was doing like Whitney Houston songs and shit

[McKeva]
I told him to come on the stage and said ""Show me what you got."" Then he went WILD and crazy. I didn't know who he was

[Logic]
After dinner, and she went to take a little break, I asked her if she wanted to come sing on my album, and she said ""yeah.""

[McKeva in the booth]

[Kev Randolph playing around on the keys]

[Bobby Campbell]
Kev, I love what you're doing, but we're gonna mute that sound

[Killing Spree Interlude]

[Booth Harmonizing]

[Confess plays]

[Logic crying]
I just had this crazy cry because I'm happy though. And I'm not trying to milk anything, but I thought I should let you know. I just wanted to in this moment-- Let you know I was listening to this song, ""Anziety"" and just thinking about how hard it is to live with it. But beyond that, the song, it made me realize how many people are here. How many people are in this house. And how blessed I am to have my wife and my dogs  and my friends and music and fans. I can't believe it. Because I didn't have anything growing up, I didn't have anything. And now I have everything I could have ever wanted. And just right now in this moment I am so happy and blessed. Sorry, I just wanted to real quick-- I'm not trying to milk it or anything. I just wanted to say that, that i can't believe it's all real and happening

[1-800-273-8255 producing]

[Khalid in the booth]

[Logic] We're at Warner Bros. We are at the soundstage where they do all the scoring for films, and we are doing the album. And I'm excited, I feel like I don't belong here

(to the orchestra)
I just wanted to say this is fucking crazy. Like, I'm sorry, this is just crazy and I know we're here to work but like I came from nothing-- so to be able to be here today is a very emotional thing. And this album is about the equality of man regardless of race, religion, color, creed and sexual orientation. This is the fight for equality

[Orchestra plays]

[6ix]
Yo, Bob, you know what's really crazy? Making a beat on Ableton of FL Studio and then like seeing that shit charted out and noted. That's amazing, isn't that like crazy

[Logic]
Yeah, we're just like Neanderthals

(Laughing)

[6ix]
Like all the sheet music, but like what we sample

[Orchestra plays]

[Bobby Hall (Logic's dad)]
My name is Bobby ""Smokey"" Hall, I'm legend. I'm the legend of hip-hop go-go. I'm here to see my son, Logic, one of the hypest artists out there. He's just in his own zone. He's got a string session going on right now. [?] so yeah, I love him

[Logic conducts the orchestra]

[Logic]
It's been an amazing experience, and I really appreciate it (Crying)

[Bobby Hall]
Bobby has always been driven, even as a kid. He was a leader, not a follower. He never followed, you know what I'm saying? he had his own way that he lived

I took Bobby in the recording studio when he was like 15 for the first time. And he spit for like 45 minutes, non-stop. The engineer and I, Rock, just laughed and said ""That boy got bars.""

[Lucy Rose]
You were talking to your mates last night on the sofa and I was just like listening in and trying to learn what you guys were talking about. And you were saying like ""We work with loads of people, but we FUCK with Logic."" And I was like... excuse me? You were like ""You know what I'm saying,  we FUCK with Logic. We FUCK with him you know what I'm saying?"" And I'm like what are you talking about? I had no idea what that meant

[Logic]
So when did that click for you what that meant?

[Lucy Rose]
Oh, only like 24 hours later, when I asked what it was. Did I ask one of you guys? I was like ""What does that mean when you fuck with someone?"" I thought if you're fucking with someone, you're fucking them up or something

(Laughing)

[Logic]
This is a classic documentary moment right here

[Who?]
Lucy, I got a better one for you. You ever heard of what a fuckboy is?

[Lucy Rose]
So yeah, that, Jess said, before she met you, ""I wen't out with a couple of fuckboys"" and I was like is that just some one like, you have sex with?

(Laughing)

She said that just means like a lame person

Well, I fuck with Logic

[Logic]
Yeah, we fuck with you Lucy Rose

[Lucy Rose]
I fuck with you all

[Logic]
We fuck with you

(Laughing)

[Logic]
It was a long-ass time ago, I'm in the studio with this mo-fucker and he brings this in
And I'm like ""Dillon what's that?"" And he's like ""its that P1 bro, for sure.""  And I'm like ""damn that's crazy, thats so cool"", he's like ""yeah man check it out"", doing all this shit and I'm like oh my god, I gotta have this

So i hopped in the whip, I go, I drop the bread on this shit immediately, and all I get out of it , like used it for. I spent all that money, and  got the kick for ""Like Woah"", and it's worth every penny

[Sir Dylan and 6ix working on Ink Blot]

[Logic]
This is rapped from the perspective of a rapper that like, the first half, it almost sounds like a sample with the vocals, but it's all myself. And he's saying like "" I don't want to sleep all day and get up at night"" like eh's not happy with  the life that he's living because he's one of those rappers focussing on money and material possessions

It's called ""Ink Blot"" because one of the line is ""I'm not me, I'm who you want me to be."" And he's rapping like ""yeah I got this money and I'm not a real rapper it's all bullshit, I'm making my money, fuck it.""

Like that personification of that rapper like that tone, chain wearing, ""yeah yeah I rap"", but deep down he's not happy, but his raps are like yeah I got this and millions. it's just a rapper who isn't happy with himself, but is making a lot of money. So that's the song
[Juciy J & Logic recording Ink Blot]
Perpetratin' ass, dumb ass mothafuckas, man
All on the 'Gram, all on the Snapchat with the bullshit
Kill yo' mothafuckin self, nigga
Kill yo' mothafuckin self, nigga
And tell yo' bitch I said slob on my knob
That’s crazy!
Yo, I’ma keep all this shit for the album
Oh they gon' love that, they gon' be like, ""Aw fuck""

[Logic]
So, we're here, on Scotch Wednesday, it's a little thing I do with my buddies. Every Wednesday, as grown men, we drink scotch, shoot pool, play some jazz and Sinatra on vinyl over there. (cheers)

[Camera man to Logic]
Did you smoke a Jefferey?

[Logic (rubbing the wall)]
Freefalllll

[Logic]
Woah wait, who has some other really good ones you can impersonate? Like Sinatra... OH give me Tonight Show All hand on deck, go

(All hands on deck)

Keep going

[Jessica]
You're gonna do great. (Kiss) ... you just totally left me hanging

[Logic]
Oh, sorry

[Driving instructor]
Hello, sir, how are you doing today?

[Logic]
I'm doing good, how are you doing?

[Instructor]
You brought the whole--

[Logic]
Yeah, we brought the whole team

[Driving Instructor]
Oh, excuse me, who is taking the picture?

[Logic]
I'm upset that I did what I'm supposed to do. That's the thing I'm telling you man. It's not like a fail. I've failed before, many times. It's just that when you know you did everything, you know you did it

[Christian Martin]
We're at the DMV. Bob's taking his driving test for the second shot. And uh, I'm a little bit nervous. I know he can drive, but just these instructors take of points for the craziest things

[Logic]
Thank you, 29, I can go in through here. Swag

Got that license though

[Black Spiderman Piano interlude]

[Logic]
""Black Spiderman"" I wrote, first and foremost, it's about stereotypes, and that people make me believe I should be ashamed of who I am, and I'm not

[Logic in the booth]

[Logic]
Like, be you, fuck EVERYBODY else, just be you. And people are goig to hate on you, they hate on me and my message is ""Peace, Love and Positivity"", and people HATE me. Like think about that... That's CRAZY! When you look at people you see things. You see a black man, you see a middle eastern man, you see,... there are people that are conditioned to look at people of color or people that are brown on an airplane a little weird. and that's so FUCKED up and I hate  that. People look at me and I go, ""I'm a rapper"", and they go ""What?"" or people are conditioned to not accept me in hip-hop because of how  i look, or how i speak. ""Oh, you speak white"" or ""you talk white"", like the fuck? I've heard that my whole life I'm saying in general for this career. What do you mean ""talk white""? What the fuck does that mean?

I said fuck that, why can't Spiderman be black? Why can't James Bon be gay? Why not? like fuck it! And that's why I open it up with ""Black Jesus, Black Jesus"". And people are like ""What? Black Jesus? What the fuck?"" Like I've got a Black Santa Clause right now in my house

[Booth Session]

[Logic]
I've known Damien for 6-7 years now, maybe even 8 years. And we've just been buddies like through the internet. And we used to do records together. I wasn't shit, I wasn't nobody. I knew I wanted him to be on the album, and he dropped EVERYTHING to come out here. With no promise of placement or anything like that, just to see where he could contribute. And I'm sitting down there, and we're working, and I'm like ""I think I need some vocals on here"". And, like I said, i trust everybody, who knows what's going to happen? You want to go in there, and let's see what you got. He told me before Bobby hit record, that you could hear it in the microphone, his heart pumping

[Damian Lemar Hudson]
And like, I could just feel the magnitude of this moment. And how pivotal it was

[Logic]
He was like ""this is 6 years in the making that just came out"". And...

[Damian]
I don't know, something just hit me and I started letting loose

[Damian in the booth]

[Damian]
Something about that, some type of [?] grabbed me and let me soar vocally

[Logic while listening]
YES! Praise him! I'm putting this on the album! GET IN HERE RIGHT NOW (to Damian). COME HERE!

[Logic]
You just earned yourself a feature credit

[Damian]
It was like one of those milestones in your career where you know you're just in the right room, and the right mind state. Everything just lined up

[Logic]
I only work with people that are as good and creative as I am in their field. I like when people make me feel fucking stupid. I like  when people are so good at playing strings, or piano, or singing, or whatever that makes me feel talentless. I can't do what they do. Like I'm Batman. I'm Player 1, I'm Super Mario, so are you guys behind the camera, so is 6ix. I don't work with Player 2s, I don't work with Robins. I work with other Batmen, and I know that sounds really weird, but what i mean by that is you, whenever you leave, and you take this camera to do whatever you do, you are a boss. You're a boss, and you go do boss shit. But when you're with me, you're under my wing, being a boss, helping me paint my boss-ass picture

[C-Sick]
With Logic, time to go to the basement. It's my time to shine. Hopefully I have something that actually like fit on the project

[Mos Definitely Interlude]

[C-Sick]
When i first met [?] I could see this [?]

[Logic in the booth]

[Killer Mike]
I mean, he's a superior lyricist. We already know that. He puts together classic albums, we know that. This is beautiful, it's rich, it's moody, it revs you up and brings you down. It's an ALBUM, and in an age where that may not be important, it's refreshing. You know? so, bravo! I've told him before, I think he's one of the best in the world

[Logic]
Mannnn, come on. Thanks man

[Lucy Rose]
Logic's music makes me feel something. I don't listen to a whole lot of hip-hop or rap music. And when I first met Bobby he did ask me "" Why do you listen to my music? Like I don't understand"". ""Like you play this sweet folk music and then you listen to my music."" but there's something about it I just can't explain, but it makes me really feel something

[Logic]
It's kind of scary. I can't explain. like when I first started making music I was willing to sacrifice everything because I had nothing to lose. But now, i have everything to lose. That isn't a bad thing. That just means I have a good life

It makes me work harder. Because I was working so hard to obtain all of this. But now I have to work even harder to keep it
Ooooo I just gave you some fire!

With my last album I went around to radio stations, and I shook hands, and I jerked people off. And I was like ""Yeah what's up!"" trying to get radio placements. But not like trying to work for the radio, but like trying to get more people to hear. And  this time, I'm like fuck that shit. I'm not going nowhere, i'm not doing any press. This album has already done what it was intended to do, and it was to set me free of any shame the public made me feel. It did what it was intended to do because I don't give a shit what anybody else thinks

And I'm really not gonna try to get too much into it, but I had a conversation with J. Cole about the public, and being on social media, and all these things. Like I don't need the public to accept me. I don't need anybody to tell me my music is great, or I'm amazing. Because I know I'm good, I know I'm great, and I know I'm amazing. Just like you, and them, so fuck anybody else and what they got to say because I know I'm good, and that's what this album is about. Knowing that you're beautiful, you're great, and you're special. Knowing that you are something, were something, and will be something

So fuck everybody else

He said, ""Everyone is getting married""
I said, ""Well, don't let that force the matter""

We're gonna get carried away

Oh, 'cause when the sea is strong
And when the vibe is good
And the music plays
And you're looking over in all your sea surging ways

And he wants to go on a silent retreat
I told him I was getting into ballet
Now I'm getting carried away, ooh

Look, it's in every day living

Something will need to start giving

Among the light of the stars and the light of the sun

Moving his blood 'round and 'round
I hope he'll dream of our future days

EPIC RAP BATTLES OF POKEMON
CREEPY BLACK
VS
LOST SILVER
BEGIN!

[Verse 1: Lost Silver]
I'M DEAD, I want to live to spit this curse at you
Turn back now or you'll be sent to your doom
Cyndaquil says ""HURRY"" 'cause this GHOST will be Unown
I'll leave you in chains like the Pokémon I own
The forgotten hero haunts this spawn of Lavender Town
This is the battle of your life. The run option's not allowed
LEAVE, or it'll be your soul that I pilfer
In this battle of horrors, you'll take second place silver

[Verse 2: Creepy Black]
Black's here to hack through your silver soul and brain
You think you'll win? Man, the word ""Lost"" is in your name
GHOST is in your party, the Lavender Town sprite spirit
I'll curse you first, even though in Generation 1, that move wasn't in it
You can't stеp to me. Hell, you can't step at all
Can't catch this brawling ghost insidе a Pokéball
You're too scared to move. You're about to get owned
And on the place I finish you off, there'll stand a tombstone

NOMORE, Your raps are giving me FRUSTRATION
You can't K.O. me! This will be my domination
Celebi will sing a Perish Song and have our Pain Split
Your data will be erased! REST IN 8 BITS

[Verse 4: Creepy Black]
Don't be giving me that Mean Look, or I'll use my Curse ability
You're Lost, Silver, when you come up against me
I murder every trainer I face. Don't even bother to fight
It's time to put you to sleep, 'cause this is your very last night

[Verse 5: BRVR]
Do you love me? If not, I'll use my thunderbolt
I know you'll never leave once I catch your souls
It's so cold down here, but my rhymes are so hot
Like what my owner did to me, I'll leave you all to ROT
You don't know the pain that's going in my chest
All of you were lying to me when you said your disses were the best
I'd rather die than listen to your lame excuses of raps
When you see my plushy in the room, it'll end in a BLOODBATH

[Verse 6: Buried Alive]
Let me come out from the ground and make you stop your strife
My time to shine and finally rip apart your lives
It's over, Pikachu, Nowhere to run and nowhere to hide
'Cause all you flee in fright when BURIEDALIVE wants to fight
Won't be tame when I've glitched your game, you're lame, will never be saved
'Cause my claim to fame: taking jokes like you to your graves
Finally, fresh meat, I've been waiting almost a century
You've reached the final floor! Now it's time to get BURIED
[Verse 7: Missingno.]
The true killer king has arrived to break your demise
No one will be missing you when I make you all di-I-I-I-I-I-I-e
Your pants, you'll be splitting when Missingno.'s spitting
These lyrics were written in the blood that's dripping
From your quitting, barely living heads since I'm hitting and ripping
There's missing-no way you'll win versus this verbal ass-kicking
Time's ticking, and ticking, and I'm winning, and grinning
I'm the glitching killing forbidden beginning of your spine-splitti-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-ing

[Verse 8: Strangled Red]
I have no reason to be here, but I'll take you all down anyways
You guys thinking you're the best has driven me even more crazed
In a world that cheated me, why should I play fair?
Just like me when Miki died, you'll all be driven to despair
I'll kill you all, I'm gonna do it, you don't wanna know what's going in my mind
This win is MINE, your guys' victory is something you can't find
Nothing can be saved now, prepare your necks, I'll strangle you all, there won't be a reset
When you step up to me, you'll end up dead, with the last thing you see is the color of red

[Verse 9: White Hand]
I can't believe you think that you all understand
You're nothing, but at least now you're in my hand
Crashing through this battle, rapping 'till you faint from this happening
Taking over your game 'cause your bodies aren't the only thing I'm hacking
Trust me, you'll be missing with no one to find the remains
All of you are fighting for supremacy, but your rapping's the same
Make all the noises you want. It'll prove to be futile
When I rip you into pieces, you'll know I made this battle BRUTAL
[Verse 10: Hypno's Lullaby]
Come with me, little children, Safe and happy you'll all be
As you rest in your beds and I DEVOUR ALL YOUR DREAMS
Don't cry, it's fine. Hypno wouldn't hurt a fly
Fortunately, all of you are NON-INVERTEBRATE SLIME
Got to Hand it to you, White. At least you proved you aren't the worst
Because Missingno. blew for every second of his verse
Hypno lied to you all. Sorry, now you're dead and done
Stay with me forever, we'll have so much fun

[Verse 11: Lavender Town Syndrome]
Come and listen to my song, I'll make all your ears bleed
You'll all be suicidal in this battle, don't believe me?
Step out of the cave, into the town and feel my power
More fearsome than the ghost of Marowak who haunts this tower
Any child who plays with me will end up being dead and severed
I'll corrupt all of you, showing you who should be feared
You think you're scary? I've got zombie Pokémon on my side
Challenging me to a battle? Better get ready to hide

[Verse 12: Ash's Coma]
I leave my home, start my journey all alone
No...(I'll catch 'em all) No... (Number one) I'll leave YOU all in a coma
Your theories aren't eerie. They're ethereal diseases
I'm the leader, and I'll turn you into Ash for your treason
(Listen!) My vision's blurry...(Stop! Pikachu!) I can't see...
I thought we were all a team. Maybe this is just a dream
Your existence is fiction. You'd rather hurt than feel hurting
Time to show you what I've learned on my Pokémon journey
Stage 1: Strike you with a bolt of lightning in my pocket
(Pikachu!) Stage 2: Ignite your fire and blast you like Team Rocket
Stage 3: Water Gun you down with flows you can't test
Stage 4: Make new friends and become the very best
If this is all in my head, sprawled in a hospital bed
Then I'm forever indebted to recycle the REM
Come on, You pasta peoples can't quite catch up!
Well, this battle is done, so let me pull the plug

Okay rap game shady, these words are dirty 380
Blasting out the window, we're skirting in the Mercedes
Either smell the roses or you pussy's push daisies
Bitches call me sugar when they should've called me crazy
Enough to drop jewels, when fools copping fugazi

We demanded more but motherfuckers was lazy
Brought it to your door but mother fuckers was Swayze
And that ain't how they made me, my niggas would've [K'd??] me
Nice with the pen so the sword don't phase me
Gentleman of leisure and development; appraise me
Shit is a fiasco but hip hop saved me
Hip hop pays me; now that I got your attention
Strong arm rapping all I needed was the henchman
Bear with me only gets worse if I ain't mention
Bury niggas under the earth is my intention

Made them kiss the ring, yes I'm greeted like a mobster
Props to the purist in this hip hop biz
It's a cold amongst niggas that grew up on Big
Got drunk off Pac, wish that Big L got
A chance to really get his shine on before he got shot

Pocket full of stones if I gotta UGK it
Watch sunshine, mother fucker UV-ray it

Nowadays happiness lies in a bottle
Showcase your wealth, what happened to being humble?
Self-centered, who going pick me up when i stumble
Every man, for themselves, my hunger feeding my struggle
Still boxed in, opinions bursting my bubble
The competition personal, its a inner hustle
You changed my way of thinking, now i'm thinking out the box
Rеmember all the wisе words, you spoke, on our walks
Refuse being stagnant, always pick up your socks
Look for the deeper meaning till my doubt is lost
I ain't lost nothing important till i lost my hope
Music is my therapy my only way to cope
Killing my demons with verses, no remorse
They left me in the dark now i got a torch
Insecurities and i split up like a divorce
I was heading for failure changed my course
Woke up and i remembered last night
Yeah, last night

J-M-E
I've had enough of these fake gangsters
Like they don't feel pain, never felt pain
Like they don't have any family
They haven't fallen in love
Or haven't watched television
Or they don't eat and sleep
They think they're waterproof, fireproof, everything-proof
I just think they're idiots

[Verse]
Punch in the face, punch in the face
Nobody wants a punch in the face
That's why everybody rolls in a group
Or with a mash, or with a baseball bat in case
They chat waste
To the wrong person and get a punch in the face
Now he can't go out with his friends
He has to jam and shot in the ends
Shot in the ends, shot in the ends
Another little kid gets shot in the ends
Everybody on the TV and the media want to blame his family and friends
But true say we all know his family and friends didn't manufacture them skengs
The government's in control
And that's why everybody's bored on road
Bored on road, bored on road
Another little kid gets bored on road
What, what, who stabbed him?
Everybody knows, but no-one disobeys the street code
'Cause if you talk to the feds, your bredrins will go into skengman mode
And when they get vexed
You'll have your hands in the air like you're doing a stretch
Doing a stretch, doing a stretch
Another black boy is doing a stretch
Coulda' been avoided if he woulda' stayed in school
And learnt punctuation like Wretch
But instead, he got into beef on road and shot a guy in his chest
What happened to the days
When you would just get a punch in the face?

It's like that's what I am, I'm either one or the other to these people. There's like just a handful, no more than I think like 4 songs, where I am truly discussing being biracial in America. With that being said, Those are the only times I discuss race, and it's my race. Not your race or his race or her race, It's just me being biracial and telling my story. And you might not like my story, but it's my story
You know, and then the entire rest of the album is rapped, you know, from different perspectives of a life that that dude Atom, who is being reincarnated has lived

[Logic In The Studio With Groups Of People]
There's a guy who dies in the beginning of this album and his name is Atom. Atom but like the ""first man"" right? But spelled A-T-O-M, like the atoms in our body and everything connecting us. He gets hit by a car and wakes up in a white void. And he's talking to this random guy. And the guy's like ""Life, What's it all about?"" And he's like ""What? What the fuck you talkin' about?"" He's like ""Where am I?"" Well, it turns out the random guy is actually God. Have you ever heard of this guy named Neil DeGrasse Tyson? Scientist, scientist, astrophysicist, crazy, super awesome, and I don't know how the hell I did it, but I got him to play the role of God on my album. Which is crazy

[Logic On His Couch]
I can't even believe that Neil DeGrasse Tyson is on this album. Like when I think about it, that's like the most gangster feature of all time

[Logic and Neil Recording]
Logic: So what now, what advice can you give me?
Neil: What advice can I give humanity?

[Logic And Friends In The Studio]
You guys know Big Von? He's like the radio DJ from the bay, on KMEL

[Steve Wyreman]
Oh Yeah

[Logic]
So he plays this guy named Atom

[Big Von and Logic Recording]
Big Von: Wait, wait, wait, what? Stop all the hippie shit
[Logic Explaining Concept]
This guy Atom dies and it's a whole conversation between them. And he finds out that he is about to be reincarnated. And then he finds out that not only that is he being reincarnated, but that he is everybody who has ever been reincarnated because there is only one human being. And he has been reincarnated so many times, in fact, that he is every human being that has ever existed. You know he was Jesus and all of his disciples. He was Hitler and everybody that he murdered. You know, every time he extended a hand of kindness to someone, he was doing it to himself. Every time he was extending a hand of hatred or murder to someone, he was only doing it onto himself. And it isn't until he has lived in the shoes of ever man, woman, child, race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation that he will know what it is to appreciate life and then be taken to the next plane of existence. So every time I'm rapping on the album pretty much, I'm rapping from the perspectives of one of the lives he has lived. So it's very sci-fi, but it's very real at the same time. It's weird man, it's a good one

[No I.D.]
Hip-Hop artists are tasked to not have any imagination, but to actually work in direct correlation to where they are from, who they were, and you know he has a lot of imagination

[Logic In His House]
I was actually really inspired when I read a short story that was written by a writer by the name of Andy Weir called ""The Egg."" I read it and it inspired me so much, and it's essentially the same thing, it's just my take on it. You know, it's a man who dies and is reincarnated and lives every life ever. And I thought ""wow,"" I relate to more than just one sect or one side of humanity or race being biracial. I kind of feel that. I feel kind of what what it's like to be two people. To be like a black man in a fair skinned body, if that makes any sense. So it's like wow, it's almost like living two separate lives to the public. Not to me, but to others.  They might view me as different people. I guess wow, that's crazy I never really thought of it like that

[No I.D.]
So bringing who he is into the stories that he wants to tell and having them intertwine with reality and fantasy, sci-fi, That's the difficult thing to score

[Logic]
I didn't think I was going to be able to pull it off. I mean how do you pull off that? How do you pull off an album rapping from different perspectives of a life that one man lived, who is actually everyone ever. it's just crazy, but I don't know how the hell it came together, but it did

[Hallelujah Interlude]

[Logic Outside His House]
This is so much more than just music. It's like a true personal part of my life. So, I'm getting my license, I'm doing my best to get fit and in shape, and deal with being mentally healthy and physically healthy. And dealing with my music and friends, wife, personal relationship, and dogs and everything. So I just want you guys to see as much of my life as you can see

[Logic Driving]
So yesterday, I think i was telling Mike that I had the wildest anxiety ever. In my mind I was like, I'm like ""I'm fine, I'm fine"" I don't know why but I was feeling physically weird. Not like ill or anything, just like- faint. You know kind of dizzy, kind of out of it. Very disconnected

[Fan Recognizes Logic]
Fan: Logic?
Logic: 'Sup dude?
Fan: What's going on man, how's you day?
Logic: Nice, I got an appointment. What's your name man?
Fan: Raymond
Logic: *Shakes his hand* Nice to meet you Raymond
Raymond: You have a great day
Logic: Thanks brother
[Logic]
Yeah, that's a big thing that I've been dealing with so much, which is like anxiety. A lot of people don't understand it and that's why I'm like having you document this right now because I want to invite everybody into my life like never before and I have severe anxiety and it's hard and it sucks

[Logic Making Beats]

[Logic]
It's just so crazy because I've always-like I'm on my shit you know what I mean? Like I'm on my shit and I know what I need to do and how I need to do things But then anxiety can step in and be like ""you feel up to having this meeting or this conversation or going on stage or performing or this or that, But I'm gonna fuck you up."" Like it's weird, it's crazy and so anxiety is so much more than just mental. it's a mental thing that can affect you physically and that's why when I had the biggest panic attack I ever had last year, you know just after The Incredible True Story was made, I was convinced I was going through was a physical thing. I was convinced it was something deeper like it was fucking cancer. Like, you know what I mean? Cause my body was so fucked up and um, it's not that. It's my mind. It's anxiety

[Making of Anziety]

[Lucy Rose]
When I went in the booth and I knew all of you guys were all out there listening, and I was learning it there and then on the spot, what he wanted me to sing. Damn, my legs were shaking, I was so nervous, It was the first time I sung it and I guess that’s when you really-like I realized that he's got a vision and I have to trust it because I wanted to practice it and get better at it, he comes back in and I was like I wanna know, I want to capture how you are right now when you're singing this for the first time

[Logic]
I think that's good, ah!

[Rose]
The first time in my life I have done anything like that

[Logic]
You never?

[Lucy Rose]
I'm not really sure how it goes

[Lucy Rose Back Outside]
Now listening back i really understand why he wanted to do that cause there was a vulnerability to what was captured that i don't know if that would have been the same if I had learnt it

[Logic and Lucy In The Booth]

[Logic Recording ""Anziety""]

[Logic]
Yo, making music makes me feel good man. Like when I'm here with you guys, like not to sound any type of way, a lot of that,I mean I still be feelin' weird, but a lot of it goes away. It's like I have purpose with you guys

[Logic Four Days Later]
Hold on, I'm trying to think... one sec'. Should it end with the hook? Or maybe-maybe that's not the hook. Maybe I keep going right now and then I bring the hook again... that's what I'll do, I will extend this verse...

[Records Rest Of ""Anziety""]

It's always really hard to recreate a vibe, because I was in such a zone the other night. I have to tap back into that same energy. It's gotta be the same

[Records More Of ""Anziety""]

Alright, NO NO. Can you pause it? I fucking hate technology. Pause it, pause it, pause it, pause it, pause it... alright can you run it back with the last shit i was doing? My fucking- my phone deleted all the shit. Fucking hate this shit

I think this is harder than when I did ""Gang Related.""

[Continues]

Let me hear that... Woo!

[Logic to Bart Simpson figure]
So I need you to bring it back so it sounds really good, you know? You gotta make it like, you gotta make my vocals pop, period. Like I'm going here and this breaks, like you gotta feel it in your soul. As the Engineer you need to know what you're doing. [Anziety bass boosted] You know what I'm saying? Gotta be really good

[Bobby Campbell]
I lost my job to Bart Simpson?

[Logic]
Yeah, you're fucking out bro

(Driving)
I was with No I.D. yesterday, Haden't seen him for a while. And we just had a real good talk. Man to man, shot some pool

[No I.D]
We shoot pool, and I just want it know I won 3 games today. (Camera man: he's gonna edit that out) it doesn't matter... WHEN YOU EDIT THIS JUST KNOW... 3-0

[Logic]
Just out of nowhere, then I played him my album. And he loved it

[No I.D.]
My thoughts were just by far his best work, for me

[Logic]
And I asked him to rap on it, and he said yeah

[No I.D.]
I mean, I can- I can rap

[Logic]
No I.D. is going to rap on my album. Which is like, what, that's so unheard of

[No I.D.]
I haven't really recorded a song in 20 years

[Logic]
I texted J. Cole and I was like, ""Yo, Deon's rapping on my album, No I.D.,"" and he was like ""WHAT? How the fuck did you get him to do that?"" and I thought about it, and I just asked him. ""Only you could get him to do that""

I've waited for this moment my whole life. Right now, nothing else matters. Just making music here with Deon

[Making of America]
The concept is how we're all and what's going on in the Native American community that's being ignored

[America Interlude]

[Logic]
America, so America came together, you all were there. That shit was crazy. I just found these like sample packs or like little things and like vocals and I was pressing them, and I was throwing drums on, and creating the pads

[Production of America beat]

When I create music I hear sounds. Distinct-- That's why you can hear my shit when you got to festivals or whatever. They sing all the words because it's catchy. All the sounds are catchy. First things you hear, Woo... that's the ""ohhhh "" and it goes off

You'll hear a switch up and then I'm just rapping from like a hood motherfucker and that's all he knows. And like, that's a lot of my own experience like with my brothers, and then my boy Lenny is like helping me voice this, you'll hear it

[Big Lenbo in the booth]

[Lenny]
When Logic approached me with the contributing to the song ""America"" he laid it out. He knew what he wanted so he gave me the inspiration. Told me exactly what he was going for in that part of the song

[No I.D.]
We worked on the first album, and I was the Executive Producer. And some of the first session into the album I pretty much knew he was a producer, not just a rapper. I told him ""hey, you don't really need me to produce your records, because you have your ideas. You need to you know have access to the personnel and techniques to deliver your thoughts.""

[Bobby Campbell]
The first album was 6ix and Logic, the exact same way they did it on the mixtapes. Like nothing has changed from that you know. These two guys, sitting in the house, not the big studio, not even down here, not anywhere special. Just the two of them sitting down with the laptop, a concept, and some kind of inspiration

[6ix]
What's crazy too is you know, the same process we were doing back in the day. Like , we didn't have the string players, we didn't have the vocalists with us. That's what's so crazy about it is, the process is the same, but now we get to involve actual real musicians, rather than me tryna sample a string part from another song because I can't play it. But now I can be like, we have Claire and Tom to actually play the shit

[Lenbo]
Big Von, he just gets really entertaining

[Big Von recording skits]

[Big Von]
Got Neil on the album, you know how crazy that is? Space, Time, all the good things like that.  Man, Logic has come up with the crazy story of all stories

[Logic to Damian Lemar Hudson]
So I was in Paris, with my wife, at the Louvre

[Sam Spratt]
So, it all started last summer when I get a call from Bob. And I pick up the phone, and It's three in the morning, and I say ""Bob, what's up man, what the fuck is this?"" And he's like ""I'm in Paris man, I'm at the Louvre, and I know what our album is going to be.""

[Logic]
Everybody is looking at the Mona Lisa, and I'm looking at the Mona Lisa like ""Wow, Leonardo Da Vinci painted this shit. Woah, this is crazy.""
But then I'm looking at, myself included, everyone is so focused on the Mona Lisa, I'm in this insane museum with all this beautiful statues and paintings and all different types of stuff. So I was like ""I'm gonna go look for something else"", not just focus on this. And I turn around, and as soon as I turn around I see this

This is The Wedding at Cana. It was when Jesus turned water into wine

[Sam Spratt]
I'm like ""Dude, doesn't that have like a hundred people in it?"" and he's like ""Yeah, it has like over 100 people. I don't know if we need that many, but like close. I want you to paint all of it. I want all my friends, all my family, everyone who works on this albums, people of all races, colors, creeds, sexual orientations, and genders. I wasn't it to be representative of Everybody.""

Early into the year I decided I wanted to go to Italy to get inspiration for this. I did my research online, went through Google image search, and I studied countless books about the artist himself, other artists in the period, but there's limits to that. there was something about it where I felt compelled-- I always wanted to go to Italy. if there was ever a chance, why not now?

I went to every possible church I could, I went to the museum, I saw the Caravaggio, I immersed myself in everything I've loved and researched and I brought it back and put everything into the cover

[Logic]
This is going to be my album cover

[Sam Spratt]
The album is told from a variety of perspectives, which is something Bob loves to do. Putting himself in someone else's shoes and taking on their struggles and success, trying to see things through their perspective. This album, listening to it, sonically connects you to the art. it just executes that flawlessly

[Logic] For the longest time, I just wanted to focus on the music and not talk about race or negative shit going on in the world because I wanted it to be happy and fun, and about lyricism and raw shit. I felt that i needed to make and album like this because me being black & white and feeling discriminated against by my own people, made me feel like I need to talk about everyone else who was discriminated against

I didn't wanna be like ""I'm biracial, but I look white and blah blah blah, no I'm really gonna talk about not only what's on my heart and mind, but whats on the hearts and minds of people all over the world who don't have the voice that I do

I am here with Patrick Starr in my studio. And I recruited him because he's amazing and awesome and he's a very sweet, kind person, and an amazing business man-- Or business queen. No, but honestly, he's just been so awesome and he's just such a great role model for so many people I wanted to include him as a representative for his culture and just have him on the album and album cover

[Starr]
Thank you! This is dope, so dope

[Logic]
I appreciate it, Thank you

[Patrick Starr in the booth]

[Logic]
I see good people who like to make good music and it's just that simple. Like ""Hey, do you like what I'm doing? Do you like what I stand for? Oh you like this message? you wanna come play? You wanna be a part of it? Yes or No?""

So I'm flying this woman out, from the Bahamas, where me and my wife went on our anniversary. Her name is Paula

[Paula McKeva]
Hiii, I'm Paula McKeva, all the was from [?], Bahamas. Met Bobby, known as Logic as well, in the Atlantis resort and Casino Hotel

[Logic]
We were at the bar having a few drinks and this shit was killing it

[McKeva]
I was singing Uptown Funk, so everyone was on the floor having fun

[Logic]
I was like up, and I was dancing with like all these older ladies and shit. It was like so fun

But like she KILLED it. Her voice was like killing it. She was doing like Whitney Houston songs and shit

[McKeva]
I told him to come on the stage and said ""Show me what you got."" Then he went WILD and crazy. I didn't know who he was

[Logic]
After dinner, and she went to take a little break, I asked her if she wanted to come sing on my album, and she said ""yeah.""

[McKeva in the booth]

[Kev Randolph playing around on the keys]

[Bobby Campbell]
Kev, I love what you're doing, but we're gonna mute that sound

[Killing Spree Interlude]

[Booth Harmonizing]

[Confess plays]

[Logic crying]
I just had this crazy cry because I'm happy though. And I'm not trying to milk anything, but I thought I should let you know. I just wanted to in this moment-- Let you know I was listening to this song, ""Anziety"" and just thinking about how hard it is to live with it. But beyond that, the song, it made me realize how many people are here. How many people are in this house. And how blessed I am to have my wife and my dogs  and my friends and music and fans. I can't believe it. Because I didn't have anything growing up, I didn't have anything. And now I have everything I could have ever wanted. And just right now in this moment I am so happy and blessed. Sorry, I just wanted to real quick-- I'm not trying to milk it or anything. I just wanted to say that, that i can't believe it's all real and happening

[1-800-273-8255 producing]

[Khalid in the booth]

[Logic] We're at Warner Bros. We are at the soundstage where they do all the scoring for films, and we are doing the album. And I'm excited, I feel like I don't belong here

(to the orchestra)
I just wanted to say this is fucking crazy. Like, I'm sorry, this is just crazy and I know we're here to work but like I came from nothing-- so to be able to be here today is a very emotional thing. And this album is about the equality of man regardless of race, religion, color, creed and sexual orientation. This is the fight for equality

[Orchestra plays]

[6ix]
Yo, Bob, you know what's really crazy? Making a beat on Ableton of FL Studio and then like seeing that shit charted out and noted. That's amazing, isn't that like crazy

[Logic]
Yeah, we're just like Neanderthals

(Laughing)

[6ix]
Like all the sheet music, but like what we sample

[Orchestra plays]

[Bobby Hall (Logic's dad)]
My name is Bobby ""Smokey"" Hall, I'm legend. I'm the legend of hip-hop go-go. I'm here to see my son, Logic, one of the hypest artists out there. He's just in his own zone. He's got a string session going on right now. [?] so yeah, I love him

[Logic conducts the orchestra]

[Logic]
It's been an amazing experience, and I really appreciate it (Crying)

[Bobby Hall]
Bobby has always been driven, even as a kid. He was a leader, not a follower. He never followed, you know what I'm saying? he had his own way that he lived

I took Bobby in the recording studio when he was like 15 for the first time. And he spit for like 45 minutes, non-stop. The engineer and I, Rock, just laughed and said ""That boy got bars.""

[Lucy Rose]
You were talking to your mates last night on the sofa and I was just like listening in and trying to learn what you guys were talking about. And you were saying like ""We work with loads of people, but we FUCK with Logic."" And I was like... excuse me? You were like ""You know what I'm saying,  we FUCK with Logic. We FUCK with him you know what I'm saying?"" And I'm like what are you talking about? I had no idea what that meant

[Logic]
So when did that click for you what that meant?

[Lucy Rose]
Oh, only like 24 hours later, when I asked what it was. Did I ask one of you guys? I was like ""What does that mean when you fuck with someone?"" I thought if you're fucking with someone, you're fucking them up or something

(Laughing)

[Logic]
This is a classic documentary moment right here

[Who?]
Lucy, I got a better one for you. You ever heard of what a fuckboy is?

[Lucy Rose]
So yeah, that, Jess said, before she met you, ""I wen't out with a couple of fuckboys"" and I was like is that just some one like, you have sex with?

(Laughing)

She said that just means like a lame person

Well, I fuck with Logic

[Logic]
Yeah, we fuck with you Lucy Rose

[Lucy Rose]
I fuck with you all

[Logic]
We fuck with you

(Laughing)

[Logic]
It was a long-ass time ago, I'm in the studio with this mo-fucker and he brings this in
And I'm like ""Dillon what's that?"" And he's like ""its that P1 bro, for sure.""  And I'm like ""damn that's crazy, thats so cool"", he's like ""yeah man check it out"", doing all this shit and I'm like oh my god, I gotta have this

So i hopped in the whip, I go, I drop the bread on this shit immediately, and all I get out of it , like used it for. I spent all that money, and  got the kick for ""Like Woah"", and it's worth every penny

[Sir Dylan and 6ix working on Ink Blot]

[Logic]
This is rapped from the perspective of a rapper that like, the first half, it almost sounds like a sample with the vocals, but it's all myself. And he's saying like "" I don't want to sleep all day and get up at night"" like eh's not happy with  the life that he's living because he's one of those rappers focussing on money and material possessions

It's called ""Ink Blot"" because one of the line is ""I'm not me, I'm who you want me to be."" And he's rapping like ""yeah I got this money and I'm not a real rapper it's all bullshit, I'm making my money, fuck it.""

Like that personification of that rapper like that tone, chain wearing, ""yeah yeah I rap"", but deep down he's not happy, but his raps are like yeah I got this and millions. it's just a rapper who isn't happy with himself, but is making a lot of money. So that's the song
[Juciy J & Logic recording Ink Blot]
Perpetratin' ass, dumb ass mothafuckas, man
All on the 'Gram, all on the Snapchat with the bullshit
Kill yo' mothafuckin self, nigga
Kill yo' mothafuckin self, nigga
And tell yo' bitch I said slob on my knob
That’s crazy!
Yo, I’ma keep all this shit for the album
Oh they gon' love that, they gon' be like, ""Aw fuck""

[Logic]
So, we're here, on Scotch Wednesday, it's a little thing I do with my buddies. Every Wednesday, as grown men, we drink scotch, shoot pool, play some jazz and Sinatra on vinyl over there. (cheers)

[Camera man to Logic]
Did you smoke a Jefferey?

[Logic (rubbing the wall)]
Freefalllll

[Logic]
Woah wait, who has some other really good ones you can impersonate? Like Sinatra... OH give me Tonight Show All hand on deck, go

(All hands on deck)

Keep going

[Jessica]
You're gonna do great. (Kiss) ... you just totally left me hanging

[Logic]
Oh, sorry

[Driving instructor]
Hello, sir, how are you doing today?

[Logic]
I'm doing good, how are you doing?

[Instructor]
You brought the whole--

[Logic]
Yeah, we brought the whole team

[Driving Instructor]
Oh, excuse me, who is taking the picture?

[Logic]
I'm upset that I did what I'm supposed to do. That's the thing I'm telling you man. It's not like a fail. I've failed before, many times. It's just that when you know you did everything, you know you did it

[Christian Martin]
We're at the DMV. Bob's taking his driving test for the second shot. And uh, I'm a little bit nervous. I know he can drive, but just these instructors take of points for the craziest things

[Logic]
Thank you, 29, I can go in through here. Swag

Got that license though

[Black Spiderman Piano interlude]

[Logic]
""Black Spiderman"" I wrote, first and foremost, it's about stereotypes, and that people make me believe I should be ashamed of who I am, and I'm not

[Logic in the booth]

[Logic]
Like, be you, fuck EVERYBODY else, just be you. And people are goig to hate on you, they hate on me and my message is ""Peace, Love and Positivity"", and people HATE me. Like think about that... That's CRAZY! When you look at people you see things. You see a black man, you see a middle eastern man, you see,... there are people that are conditioned to look at people of color or people that are brown on an airplane a little weird. and that's so FUCKED up and I hate  that. People look at me and I go, ""I'm a rapper"", and they go ""What?"" or people are conditioned to not accept me in hip-hop because of how  i look, or how i speak. ""Oh, you speak white"" or ""you talk white"", like the fuck? I've heard that my whole life I'm saying in general for this career. What do you mean ""talk white""? What the fuck does that mean?

I said fuck that, why can't Spiderman be black? Why can't James Bon be gay? Why not? like fuck it! And that's why I open it up with ""Black Jesus, Black Jesus"". And people are like ""What? Black Jesus? What the fuck?"" Like I've got a Black Santa Clause right now in my house

[Booth Session]

[Logic]
I've known Damien for 6-7 years now, maybe even 8 years. And we've just been buddies like through the internet. And we used to do records together. I wasn't shit, I wasn't nobody. I knew I wanted him to be on the album, and he dropped EVERYTHING to come out here. With no promise of placement or anything like that, just to see where he could contribute. And I'm sitting down there, and we're working, and I'm like ""I think I need some vocals on here"". And, like I said, i trust everybody, who knows what's going to happen? You want to go in there, and let's see what you got. He told me before Bobby hit record, that you could hear it in the microphone, his heart pumping

[Damian Lemar Hudson]
And like, I could just feel the magnitude of this moment. And how pivotal it was

[Logic]
He was like ""this is 6 years in the making that just came out"". And...

[Damian]
I don't know, something just hit me and I started letting loose

[Damian in the booth]

[Damian]
Something about that, some type of [?] grabbed me and let me soar vocally

[Logic while listening]
YES! Praise him! I'm putting this on the album! GET IN HERE RIGHT NOW (to Damian). COME HERE!

[Logic]
You just earned yourself a feature credit

[Damian]
It was like one of those milestones in your career where you know you're just in the right room, and the right mind state. Everything just lined up

[Logic]
I only work with people that are as good and creative as I am in their field. I like when people make me feel fucking stupid. I like  when people are so good at playing strings, or piano, or singing, or whatever that makes me feel talentless. I can't do what they do. Like I'm Batman. I'm Player 1, I'm Super Mario, so are you guys behind the camera, so is 6ix. I don't work with Player 2s, I don't work with Robins. I work with other Batmen, and I know that sounds really weird, but what i mean by that is you, whenever you leave, and you take this camera to do whatever you do, you are a boss. You're a boss, and you go do boss shit. But when you're with me, you're under my wing, being a boss, helping me paint my boss-ass picture

[C-Sick]
With Logic, time to go to the basement. It's my time to shine. Hopefully I have something that actually like fit on the project

[Mos Definitely Interlude]

[C-Sick]
When i first met [?] I could see this [?]

[Logic in the booth]

[Killer Mike]
I mean, he's a superior lyricist. We already know that. He puts together classic albums, we know that. This is beautiful, it's rich, it's moody, it revs you up and brings you down. It's an ALBUM, and in an age where that may not be important, it's refreshing. You know? so, bravo! I've told him before, I think he's one of the best in the world

[Logic]
Mannnn, come on. Thanks man

[Lucy Rose]
Logic's music makes me feel something. I don't listen to a whole lot of hip-hop or rap music. And when I first met Bobby he did ask me "" Why do you listen to my music? Like I don't understand"". ""Like you play this sweet folk music and then you listen to my music."" but there's something about it I just can't explain, but it makes me really feel something

[Logic]
It's kind of scary. I can't explain. like when I first started making music I was willing to sacrifice everything because I had nothing to lose. But now, i have everything to lose. That isn't a bad thing. That just means I have a good life

It makes me work harder. Because I was working so hard to obtain all of this. But now I have to work even harder to keep it
Ooooo I just gave you some fire!

With my last album I went around to radio stations, and I shook hands, and I jerked people off. And I was like ""Yeah what's up!"" trying to get radio placements. But not like trying to work for the radio, but like trying to get more people to hear. And  this time, I'm like fuck that shit. I'm not going nowhere, i'm not doing any press. This album has already done what it was intended to do, and it was to set me free of any shame the public made me feel. It did what it was intended to do because I don't give a shit what anybody else thinks

And I'm really not gonna try to get too much into it, but I had a conversation with J. Cole about the public, and being on social media, and all these things. Like I don't need the public to accept me. I don't need anybody to tell me my music is great, or I'm amazing. Because I know I'm good, I know I'm great, and I know I'm amazing. Just like you, and them, so fuck anybody else and what they got to say because I know I'm good, and that's what this album is about. Knowing that you're beautiful, you're great, and you're special. Knowing that you are something, were something, and will be something

So fuck everybody else

K-mel,I Do Believe in Love,"5 ContributorsI Do Believe in Love LyricsThey say we never landed on the moon
There's no wind there, they assume
I guess conspiracies are nothing new
But I'm sure I've been there with you
And I don't believe that in space
The only life is here on earth
How could we be the only race
That loves and hates 'til death from birth?
But I do believe in love
Though I should never rely on love
Nothing else excites me
But loving you
Is it true a politician's heart
Can rust away and fall apart?
I guess it must be hard
It must be hard to know what's good
And to know what's easy
You might think it's strange
For all my wild ideas
But I do not believe that change
Can ever happen without tears
But I do believe in love
Though I should never rely on love
Nothing else excites me
But loving youYou might also likeEmbed"

You don't wanna stop claiming till the heat hit ya
I reach a , golden dream with my broke nigga hands
Even the paralyzed always had a dream to dance
Chorus

Verse 2

Cause being born broke is the worst though
I’ve been on this feeling for a while it ain’t nice jo
Mammies they don't wanna mess with you nah boy
Walking in the mall looking at the things you can’t afford
Story of a youngin living ekasi
Before he got to Joburg he was living Emlazi
Saw the kasi life / Rich kids blowing money
Drinking out the bottle and surrounded by them mommies
He wanted that life so bad , He would kill for it
Started making new friends that will lead to it
Plans didn't work out / Parents didn't help
No money to eat at home , He just wanted swagger
You gotta work for what you want / Yeah mama said it
I'm on that hustle everyday praying that i get it
Cause people they never around when you ain’t got none
But after the riches they be sending accounts
Chorus

All i ever wanted was to go big
My name on your head / Face on the magazine
Being born broke made me wanna get it all

K-mel,I Never Fall,"3 ContributorsI Never Fall LyricsWhen you fall in love t
Too careless and too fast
It may never last
It’s a freighting view
You’ll fall down with a bump
I never fall, I always jump

There’s a certain risk
What can your heart stand?
Some things can be planned
But if you get to fly
Landing’s worth a thought
I never fall, I always jump

One step at a time
The edge is getting nearer
Now that we’ve met
The world seems clearer
Before we know it’s now or never
So let’s jump together

If he takes your heart
Takes you out to hide
And you don’t question that
But if he lies to you
You’ll crush down with a thump
I never fall, I always jump
I never fall, I always jump
I never fall, I always jumpYou might also likeEmbed"

(*Birds chirping*)

(*Someone's snoring*)

(*Sample of Alarm Clock's Ringing*)
Awww shit!!

[The D.O.C.]
Here we go, here we go

[Dr. Dre as a radio host]
Wake your motherfucking ass up
This is Radio Station KM.G, 187 on your dial
And what I want you to do is tune in at 5 O'clock and listen to the homeboys
Total K-oss and Go-Mack, they'll gonna be rocking them big ol bitches on the traffic Jam
Next stop be your music right after these messages

[Skit: Commercial by white boy]
""Are you tired of looking whack?
""Do you wanna look cool?""
""Are you tired of people being in your business?""
""Well, you need not worry again, get some locs""
""That's right, some locs""
""For the amazingly low price of $4.99""
You might also like""Now, available at your nearest South Central liquor store""

[Dr. Dre as a radio host]
Yeah, this Radio station KM.G
And whenever you wanna hear some funky shit, put your dial on 187
Now, some new music by some homeboys out of South Central
Here's A.T.L., and they called this one livin' like hustlers

[Cold 187Um]
Let me start it off, cause I'm a player
Fade into part two, I'm the number one hoe layer
A mack, a player and a pimp
Something much stronger than your average drink
Now, correct me if I'm wrong, I'm like moonshine
Take a sip of my rhyme and I'll take over your mind
Cause I don't think like the average thinker
Call me the nightstalker or your neighborhood head shrinker
187 is like a megablast
I take too many names, I kick too much ass

[KM.G]
KM.G, the number one mack daddy
Eating chicken like a motherfucker, rolling in my Caddy
With my brim cold bent to the side, I bump and slide
Go-Mack in the back, 187 to the side
Street Pilgrims, pioneering the land
Above the Law status, with a gat in my hand
A mind designed like Frank Nitty
Living large on the Mic, doing damage for the city
The city of toners, which is known as L.A
Where the hustlers hustle and the ballers play
We got the dope beats from the homeboy Dre
And it had to be done (How?) the Ruthless way
187, what's up?
What do we do at our show?
[Cold 187Um]
We wear black on black with the Locs and the Romeos
Start stepping, unload my Mic weapon
We say it's fitting, you think it's hitting
K.M.G means Knowledge Most Greatly
Some people like me, most people hate me
In other words, I kick my gift
Do you be sleeping, KM.G?
No, I don't drift
I lounge or lay, cause suckers take advantage
Yo, what do we do to them?
Yo, we're doing damage
Cause we not punks, fools, sissies, or busters
And the way that we live.. is like hustlers

[Hook: Dr. Dre]
AWWWWWWWoow
Ooohh Lord, living like a hustler
Ooohh Lord, living like a hustler

[Cold 187Um]
I used to sell big llello on the block
That when all the hardheads, gain on hard knocks
I started with Gs and then I moved to keys
And at this point my life went with ease
In other words, my pockets was thick
I didn't worry about the Feds, I was checking the mitt
Pull a swoop to Farouk, got dressed to please
Got the crib pimped out so that the bitches flee
I bought a ride, ""what Kind?""
A white Corvette
So I can do a ghost move when it's time to jet
[KM.G]
When I was nineteen, I was on my own
Hooked up big connections on my mobile phone
At home, or maybe on my person
To clock big Gs, I'd be definitely certain
To live the lifestyle, the luxury, the freaks, the thrills
Yo, you was living kind of large, man
On the real, deals was being made
Suckers was getting sprayed
In other words, we was getting paid
Like hustlers

[Hook: Dr. Dre]
AWWWWWWWoow
Ooohh Lord, living like a hustler
Ooohh Lord, living like a hustler

[Cold 187Um]
Let me proceed, cause I got the green light
For the numero uno 87, it must be hype
For now, let me lay the cards on the table
So you can figure out who's worried or stable
I max and tax and relax and stack Gs
Stick that to the facts, that's why I crack them with ease
Please, get off the convoy, I think you're confused
When you cross, I told you you'd get tossed, and you lose
Now, A-B-O-V-E L-A-W, to some people
Yo, that spells trouble
But we're not a group promoting violence
But when it comes to speaking the real, I won't be silent
Speak all reality when I'm on the Mic
So you don't have to run and have a stereotype
See, see cause stereotypes will make you dumb
So kick back and listen, yo, to the knowledge that's grump

[KM.G]
See, the law has provided me, the KM.G
That's complex with the style but done easily
Pitch a bitch if I have to, you know why?
I'm undercover doing dirt, I'm a hell of a spy
Now numero 187 is a detonator, deadly than a hand grenade
Much harder than a fool to fade
Not a Forty, not a Quart or a Six-pack
Me, K.M.G, Total Kaos, and Go-Mack
Cause I unload my weapon with force
Yeah, I'm never detected, I leave respected
As a baller, a player or a pimp
Yo, pass me the forty, I commence to dent

[Cold 187Um]
A sissy soft sucker with no title
Unplug the machine, 187 is vital
Like a Beretta, with a mega clip
With a silencer on it, with the hollow point tip
But that is our business, on that we won't dwell
We make records for you to learn: Listen and Tell
Tell your mammas, tell a friend, tell a fool or a jerk
Tell them KM.G people it's time to put in some work
Like Hustlers

K-mel,It’s Only Pain,"2 ContributorsGarden Lyrics[Verse 1: Sam Turpin]

Sometimes I wish it wasn't this
Pain and frustration
Steady tolerating all the fuckshit of the nation
And dealing with my family; I'm so sick of hospitals
Pharmacists and narcissists, I used to love to gaze
Out of the window through the raindrops and the haze!
But now it's like I cannot look, society's some cannibals
And I feel
That I'm steady losing feeling!
My girl was protesting 'think she's gonna need some healing!
So yes that's on me too
And I go to uni too!
You would think I have nine lives but this cat is only human, boo!
Oh, ain't that some shit? It means I'm just like the rest!
Your boy makes mistakes, got some demons in his chest
And his mind and his memory, nah, fuck this energy!
In all honesty I'm quite content with how I'm living;
I got some rice in my kitchen and some rides up in the rhythm
So;
All I need's to live, love and hope for the best
As time ticks on and the rhymes flow on, bet!

[Hook: Sam Turpin]

(A place where my heart, my body and my soul
Can rest and meditate, meditate, take a break, take a break
From the hate and then take the pain away)

Oh I (I) need - a place to rest!
(A place where my heart, my mind and my chest
Can chill and meditate. meditate, take a break, take a break
From the hate and then take the pain away like)

[Verse 2: Sam Turpin]

Check! I would like a private garden -
To walk and clear my head so I can hear the bees buzzing!
You know, a little Zen thing like they have up in Japan
With nobody there to bring the war or politics of man!
Got some flowers over there, and a bonsai just below, and I also got some rocks and a few intyatyambo, that's some Xhosa for you buddy
I also speak a little French
Gonna have some dandelions and over there; a little bench
Like the one that's in the ""Cranes"" video, 2013 -
When I entered in this rap shit as just a little teen!
Straight out of high school, my cousin's old bean
When I crashed at her crib, shout out my aunty Martine!
Gonna have a rock garden that meanders 'round a dam!
Hang a wind chime fam for the big time band!
But it will only be for me, a place of solitude!
Got an excuse as I recluse from the bombaclaart abuse
Of this inner city living kodwa bona bayang'hleba
Manje k'mele ngibaxolela because I'm really not that better;
I'm always battling my ego and it does lead my astray!
I've done some bad things but I know there gon' come a day -
Where I walk among the leaves, take a seat, maybe breath
As I speak into this mic, the emotions that I'm feeling, check!Embed"

{Verse 1: Psycho Puppet]
I'm back to attack it's the return of the puppet
The music you used to hate now you learning to love it
My competitors are left with the dirt and the rubbish
I like room service breakfast served with a muffin
Watch out cause I slice you up with precision
Get split in half call it an intermission
The rest are softer than a little kitten
Don't step to me I mean business with it
The puppet is the GOAT what more I gotta say
I can feel the real rap now it's coursing through my veins
I never wrote a bar for just the fortune and the fame
I wrote em for those who just hate so I could scorch em with the flames
I got more bars than a convicted felon
If you disagree I cave in ya melon
Then end ya whole career with a single sentence
You been disrespected and I really meant it

You heard we were back in action

Hit up surfrider for that salad

Swoop into the game like a falcon
6 Bags but we don't live in a palace

""The one that makes me laugh"", he said
And threw his arms around my neck
""Show me how you do it
And I promise you, I promise
That I'll run away with you
I'll run away with you""
Spinning on that dizzy edge
I kissed his face and I kissed his head
And dreamed of all the different ways
I had to make him glow
""Why are you so far away?"", he said
""Why won't you ever know that I'm in love with you?
That I'm in love with you?""

You, soft and only
You, lost and lonely
You, strange as angels
Dancing in the deepest oceans
Twisting in the water
You're just like a dream
You're just like a dream

Daylight licked me into shape
I must have been asleep for days
And moving lips to breathe his name
I opened up my eyes
I found myself alone, alone
Alone above the raging sea
That stole the only boy I loved
And drowned him deep inside of me

K-mel,Lie In the Heat,"1 ContributorSet It Off LyricsI ain't no regular degular I am the type of nigga who can set it off
Like queen Latifah jada pinketh im smithing these bars and I swear I ain't givin up
I try to give love but I'm also a thug truly speaking I just can't give enough
Never say I'm underrated it's all on me, I haven't been working hard

I embrace and was raised in the six and can make  a nigga shit his pants if he piss me off
I'm not proud to say this, i speak about changes, the truth and I ain't planning on shutting up
They emptying clips on the women and kids and the truth is cops are really killing us
The  people in power are just gon devour the money that they should   us

Growing us, Healing us, feeding us, at least, give us education funds
Eskom and telkom are tripping, capitec, political parties are failing us
Time for elections they come to our villages sing with us talk like they know wassup
And all they are doing is blowing the money on private parties and they fancy cars

They dont got no drive, take us for a ride and break everything right in front of us
Right in our eyes, the music don't lie, so speak all your shit man just open up
Get too much pressure from our peers and lectures, partners, lovers, while they should be teaching  us
About faith and love and motivation, trust and peace and patience, pacing and not going fast

Unfinished calls and Prison walls is all my cousin's seeing while I'm getting dick calls
I'm tryna ball like I'm Jordan and nikey,  say they like me, get ticked off
I was always the choice and i barely made noise, and it worked out cause I wasn't picked on
They said go to school or start working, you're growing, I got on my feet and  kicks on

How many people you know graduated and still got a job in a same field
I'm not jealous or hating, I'm expressing my views about this education
It's too colonized, they telling us lies and not about home and its natives
African pride, brown in eyes, love in our heart and no hatred
You might also likeI'm posing a threat, I'm not turning my back while these niggas are busy with selfies
I'm not going hard cause of fame but the ice and the papers with Mandela faces
Double O gang, is the only one thing that I love and will take me to places
But lately a nigga is tripping like Rowlene and David, I'm going through


God....damn... That's enough with Political drama
Man I'm always addressing the people and bringing the heat every verse is a SONA/
Lemme focus on getting the boys out the hood, my health, take care of my
Cause the shit that we see everyday, replays in your brain and can put you through trauma

I'm tryna patch up the leaks and kids, I'm an emotional plumber
I got a nephew and siblings so mfethu, k'mele ng'secure iSkhwama

Don't come short with my mo-ney
I'll only tell you once Tony
""Don't f**k me, don't you ever try to f**k me""
If so, trust me, you outta luck B

Blue mercedes, three pounds under the blue avy
Bomb crews my mind power beyond you
Now I push your hair line back
Do what the con do
I warned you, and sworn no talking
Bring the thing out
Got the block surrounded like cops

K-mel,"Mad, Mad Men","5 ContributorsEastward Ho ~  Prologue  & Act 2. Scene 2 LyricsBefore  SECURITY'S  House.
Enter  SECURITY,  solus.
Sec.
My privy guest, lusty Quicksilver, has drunk too deep of the bride-bowl; but, with a little sleep, he is much recovered; and, I think, is making himself ready to be drunk in a gallanter likeness. My house is as 't were the cave where the young outlaw hoards the stolen vails of his occupation; and here, when he will revel it in his prodigal similitude, he retires to his trunks, and (I may say softly) his punks: he dares trust me with the keeping of both; for I am security itself; my name is Security, the famous usurer.

Enter  QUICKSILVER  in his prentice's coat and cap, his gallant breeches and stockings, gartering himself.
Quick.
Come, old Security, thou father of destruction! th' indented sheepskin is burn'd wherein I was wrapp'd; and I am now loose, to get more children of perdition into thy usurous bonds. Thou feed'st my lechery, and I thy covetousness; thou art pander to me for my wench, and I to thee for thy cozenages. K. me, K. thee runs through court and country.

Sec.
Well said, my subtle Quicksilver! These K's ope the doors to all this world's felicity; the dullest forehead sees it. Let not Master Courtier think he carries all the knavery on his shoulders: I have known poor Hob in the country, that has worn hobnails on 's shoes, have as much villainy in 's head as he that wears gold buttons in 's cap.

Quick.
Why, man, 't is the London highway to thrift; if virtue be us'd, 't is but as a scrap to the net of villainy. They that use it simply, thrive simply, I warrant. Weight and fashion makes goldsmiths cuckolds.
Enter  SINDEFY,  with  QUICKSILVER'S  doublet, cloak, rapier, and dagger.
Sin.
Here, sir, put off the other half of your prenticeship.

Quick.
Well said, sweet Sin. Bring forth my bravery.
Now let my trunks shoot forth their silks conceal'd;
I now am free, and now will justify
My trunks and punks. Avaunt, dull flat cap, then!
Via,  the curtain that shadowed Borgia!
There lie, thou husk of my envassall'd state;
I, Samson, now have burst the Philistines' bands,
And in thy lap, my lovely Dalila,
I'll lie and snore out my enfranchis'd state.
[ Singing ]When Samson was a tall young man,
His power and strength increased than;
He sold no more nor cup nor can;
But did them all despise.
Old Touchstone, now write to thy friends
For one to sell thy base gold ends;
Quicksilver now no more attends
Thee, Touchstone.But, dad, hast thou seen my running gelding dress'd to-day?
Sec.
That I have, Frank. The ostler a' th' Cock dressed him for a breakfast.

Quick.
What, did he eat him?

Sec.
No, but he ate his breakfast for dressing him; and so dress'd him for breakfast.

Quick.
O witty age! where age is young in wit,
And all youths' words have graybeards full of it!
Sin.
But alas, Frank! how will all this be maintain'd now? Your place maintain'd it before.

Quick.
Why, and I maintain'd my place. I'll to the court: another manner of place for maintenance, I hope, than the silly city. I heard my father say, I heard my mother sing an old song and a true: ""Thou art a she fool, and know'st not what belongs to our male wisdom."" I shall be a merchant, forsooth! trust my estate in a wooden trough as he does? What are these ships but tennis balls for the winds to play withal? — toss'd from one wave to another; now under-line, now over the house; sometimes brick-wall'd against a rock, so that the guts fly out again; sometimes struck under the wide hazard, and farewell, Master Merchant.

Sin.
Well, Frank, well: the seas, you say, are uncertain: but he that sails in your court seas shall find 'em ten times fuller of hazard; wherein to see what is to be seen is torment more than a free spirit can endure; but, when you come to suffer, how many injuries swallow you! What care and devotion must you use to humor an imperious lord, proportion your looks to his looks, smiles to his smiles; fit your sails to the winds of his breath!

Quick.
Tush! he's no journeyman in his craft that cannot do that.

Sin.
But he's worse then a prentice that does it, not only humoring the lord, but every trencher-bearer, every groom that by indulgence and intelligence crept into his favor, and by panderism into his chamber. He rules the roast; and, when my honorable Lord says it shall be thus, my worshipful rascal, the groom of his close-stool, says it shall not be thus, claps the door after him, and who dares enter? A prentice, quoth you? 'T is but to learn to live; and does that disgrace a man? He that rises hardly, stands firmly; but he that rises with ease, alas, falls as easily.
Quick.
A pox on you! who taught you this morality?

Sec.
'T is 'long of this witty age, Master Francis. But, indeed, Mistress Sindefy, all trades complain of inconvenience, and therefore 't is best to have none. The merchant, he complains and says, ""Traffic is subject to much uncertainty and loss."" Let 'em keep their goods on dry land, with a vengeance, and not expose other men's substances to the mercy of the winds, under protection of a wooden wall, as Master Francis says; and all for greedy desire to enrich themselves with unconscionable gain, two for one, or so; where I, and such other honest men as live by lending money, are content with moderate profit, thirty or forty i' th' hundred, so we may have it with quietness, and out of peril of wind and weather, rather than run those dangerous courses of trading, as they do.

Quick.
Ay, dad, thou mayst well be called Security, for thou takest the safest course.

Sec.
Faith, the quieter, and the more contented, and, out of doubt, the more godly; for merchants, in their courses, are never pleas'd, but ever repining against Heaven: one prays for a westerly wind, to carry his ship forth; another for an easterly, to bring his ship home; and, at every shaking of a leaf, he falls into an agony, to think what danger his ship is in on such a coast, and so forth. The farmer, he is ever at odds with the weather: sometimes the clouds have been too barren; sometimes the heavens forget themselves. Their harvests answer not their hopes: sometimes the season falls out too fruitful, corn will bear no price, and so forth. Th' artificer, he's all for a stirring world: if his trade be too dull, and fall short of his expectation, then falls he out of joint. Where we that trade nothing but money are free from all this; we are pleas'd with all weathers. Let it rain or hold up, be calm or windy, let the season be whatsoever, let trade go how it will, we take all in good part, e'en what please the Heavens to send us, so the sun stand not still and the moon keep her usual returns, and make up days, months, and years.

Quick.
And you have good security!
Sec.
Ay, marry, Frank, that's the special point.

Quick.
And yet, forsooth, we must have trades to live withal; for we cannot stand without legs, nor fly without wings, and a number of such scurvy phrases. No, I say still, he that has wit, let him live by his wit; he that has none, let him be a tradesman.

Sec.
Witty Master Francis! 'T is pity any trade should dull that quick brain of yours. Do but bring knight Petronel into my parchment toils once, and you shall never need to toil in any trade, a' my credit. You know his wife's land?

Quick.
Even to a foot, sir; I have been often there: a pretty fine seat, good land, all entire within itself.
Sec.
Well wooded?

Quick.
Two hundred pounds' worth of wood ready to fell. And a fine sweet house, that stands just in the midst an 't, like a prick in the midst of a circle; would I were your farmer, for a hundred pound a year!

Sec.
Excellent Master Francis! how I do long to do thee good! How I do hunger and thirst to have the honor to enrich thee! Ay, even to die, that thou mightest inherit my living; even hunger and thirst! For, a' my religion, Master Francis — and so tell knight Petronel — I do it to do him a pleasure.

Quick.
Marry, dad, his horses are now coming up to bear down his lady; wilt thou lend him thy stable to set 'em in?

Sec.
Faith, Master Francis, I would be loth to lend my stable out of doors; in a greater matter I will pleasure him, but not in this.

Quick.
A pox of your hunger and thirst! Well, dad, let him have money; all he could anyway get is bestowed on a ship now bound for Virginia; the frame of which voyage is so closely convey'd that his new lady nor any of her friends know it. Notwithstanding, as soon as his lady's hand is gotten to the sale of her inheritance, and you have furnish'd him with money, he will instantly hoist sail and away.

Sec.
Now a frank gale of wind go with him, Master Frank! we have too few such knight adventurers! Who would not sell away competent certainties to purchase, with any danger, excellent uncertainties? Your true knight venturer ever does it. Let his wife seal to-day; he shall have his money to-day.

Quick.
To-morrow she shall, dad, before she goes into the country; to work her to which action with the more engines, I purpose presently to prefer my sweet Sin here to the place of her gentlewoman; whom you, for the more credit, shall present as your friend's daughter, a gentlewoman of the country, new come up with a will for awhile to learn fashions forsooth, and be toward some lady; and she shall buzz pretty devices into her lady's ear; feeding her humors so serviceably, as the manner of such as she is, you know —

Sec.
True, good Master Francis.

Quick.
That she shall keep her port open to anything she commends to her.

Sec.
A' my religion, a most fashionable project; as good she spoil the lady, as the lady spoil her; for 't is three to one of one side. — Sweet Mistress Sin, how are you bound to Master Francis! I do not doubt to see you shortly wed one of the head men of our city.

Sin.
But, sweet Frank, when shall my father Security present me?

Quick.
With all festination; I have broken the ice to it already; and will presently to the knight's house, whither, my good old dad, let me pray thee, with all formality to man her.

Sec.
Command me, Master Francis; I do hunger and thirst to do thee service! — Come, sweet Mistress Sin, take leave of my Winifred, and we will instantly meet frank Master Francis at your lady's.


Enter  WINIFRED  above.
Win.
Where is my Cu there? Cu?

Sec.
Ay, Winnie.

Win.
Wilt thou come in, sweet Cu?

Sec.
Ay, Winnie, presently.

Exeunt  all but  QUICKSILVER.


Quick.
""Ay, Winnie,"" quod he. That's all he can do, poor man; he may well cut off her name at ""Winnie."" Oh, 't is an egregious pander! What will not an usurous knave be, so he may be rich? Oh, 't is a notable Jews' trump! I hope to live to see dogs' meat made of the old usurer's flesh, dice of his bones, and indentures of his skin; and yet his skin is too thick to make parchment; 't would make good boots for a peterman to catch salmon in. Your only smooth skin to make fine vellum is your Puritan's skin; they be the smoothest and slickest knaves in a country.
Enter  SIR PETRONEL,  in boots, with a riding-wand.
Pet.
I'll out of this wicked town as fast as my horse can trot! Here's now no good action for a man to spend his time in. Taverns grow dead; ordinaries are blown up; plays are at a stand; houses of hospitality at a fall; not a feather waving, nor a spur jingling anywhere. I'll away instantly.

Quick.
Y'ad best take some crowns in your purse, knight, or else your Eastward Castle will smoke but miserably.

Pet.
Oh, Frank! my castle? Alas! all the castles I have are built with air, thou know'st.
Quick.
I know it, knight, and therefore wonder whither your lady is going.

Pet.
Faith, to seek her fortune, I think. I said I had a castle and land eastward, and eastward she will, without contradiction; her coach and the coach of the sun must meet full butt. And, the sun being outshined with her Ladyship's glory, she fears he goes westward to hang himself.

Quick.
And I fear, when her enchanted castle becomes invisible, her Ladyship will return and follow his example.

Pet.
Oh, that she would have the grace! for I shall never be able to pacify her, when she sees herself deceived so.

Quick.
As easily as can be. Tell her she mistook your directions, and that shortly yourself will down with her to approve it; and then clothe but her crupper in a new gown, and you may drive her any way you list. For these women, sir, are like Essex calves: you must wriggle 'em on by the tail still, or they will never drive orderly.

Pet.
But, alas, sweet Frank! thou know'st my ability will not furnish her blood with those costly humors.

Quick.
Cast that cost on me, sir. I have spoken to my old pander, Security, for money or commodity; if you will, I know he will procure you.

Pet.
Commodity! Alas! what commodity?

Quick.
Why, sir, what say you to figs and raisins?

Pet.
A plague of figs and raisins, and all such frail commodities! We shall make nothing of 'em.

Quick.
Why then, sir, what say you to forty pound in roasted beef?

Pet.
Out upon't. I have less stomach to that than to the figs and raisins. I'll out of town, though I sojourn with a friend of mine; for stay here I must not: my creditors have laid to arrest me, and I have no friend under heaven but my sword to bail me.

Quick.
God's me, knight, put 'em in sufficient sureties, rather than let your sword bail you! Let 'em take their choice, either the King's Bench or the Fleet, or which of the two Counters they like best, for, by the Lord, I like none of 'em.

Pet.
Well, Frank, there is no jesting with my earnest necessity; thou know'st if I make not present money to further my voyage begun, all's lost, and all I have laid out about it.

Quick.
Why, then, sir, in earnest; if you can get your wise lady to set her hand to the sale of her inheritance, the bloodhound, Security, will smell out ready money for you instantly.

Pet.
There spake an angel: to bring her to which conformity, I must fain myself extremely amorous; and, alleging urgent excuses for my stay behind, part with her as passionately as she would from her foisting hound.

Quick.
You have the sow by the right ear, sir. I warrant there was never child long'd more to ride a cockhorse or wear his new coat than she longs to ride in her new coach. She would long for everything when she was a maid, and now she will run mad for 'em. I lay my life, she will have every year four children; and what charge and change of humor you must endure while she is with child, and how she will tie you to your tackling till she be with child, a dog would not endure. Nay, there is no turnspit dog bound to his wheel more servilely than you shall be to her wheel; for, as that dog can never climb the top of his wheel but when the top comes under him, so shall you never climb the top of her contentment but when she is under you.

Pet.
'Slight, how thou terrifiest me!

Quick.
Nay, hark you, sir; what nurses, what midwives, what fools, what physicians, what cunning women must be sought for (fearing sometimes she is bewitch'd, sometimes in a consumption), to tell her tales, to talk bawdy to her, to make her laugh, to give her glisters, to let her blood under the tongue and betwixt the toes; how she will revile and kiss you, spit in your face, and lick it off again; how she will vaunt you are her creature; she made you of nothing; how she could have had thousand-mark jointures; she could have been made a lady by a Scotch knight, and never ha' married him; she could have had panadas in her bed every morning; how she set you up, and how she will pull you down — you'll never be able to stand of your legs to endure it.

Pet.
Out of my fortune! what a death is my life bound face to face to! The best is, a large time-fitted conscience is bound to nothing: marriage is but a form in the school of policy, to which scholars sit fast'ned only with painted chains. Old Security's young wife is ne'er the further off with me.

Quick.
Thereby lies a tale, sir. The old usurer will be here instantly, with my punk Sindefy, whom you know your lady has promis'd me to entertain for her gentlewoman; and he, with a purpose to feed on you, invites you most solemnly by me to supper.

Pet.
It falls out excellently fitly; I see desire of gain makes jealously venturous.

Enter  GERTRUDE.

See, Frank, here comes my lady. Lord, how she views thee! She knows thee not, I think, in this bravery.

Ger.
How now? who be you, I pray?

Quick.
One Master Francis Quicksilver, an 't please your Ladyship.

Ger.
[ aside ] God's my dignity! as I am a lady, if he did not make me blush so that mine eyes stood a-water. Would I were unmarried again!—


Enter  SECURITY  and  SINDEFY.


Where's my woman, I pray?

Quick.
See, madam, she now comes to attend you.

Sec.
God save my honorable knight and his worshipful lady!

Ger.
Y' are very welcome; you must not put on your hat yet.

Sec.
No, madam; till I know your Ladyship's further pleasure, I will not presume.

Ger.
And is this a gentleman's daughter new come out of the country?

Sec.
She is, madam; and one that her father hath a special care to bestow in some honorable lady's service, to put her out of her honest humors, forsooth; for she had a great desire to be a nun, an 't please you.

Ger.
A nun? what nun? a nun substantive? or a nun adjective?

Sec.
A nun substantive, madam, I hope if a nun be a noun. But, I mean, lady, a vow'd maid of that order.

Ger.
I'll teach her to be a maid of the order, I warrant you. And can you do any work belongs to a lady's chamber?

Sin.
What I cannot do, madam, I would be glad to learn.

Ger.
Well said! Hold up, then; hold up your head, I say; come hither a little.

Sin.
I thank your Ladyship.

Ger.
And hark you — good man, you may put on your hat now; I do not look on you — I must have you of my faction now; not of my knight's, maid.

Sin.
No, forsooth, Madam, of yours.

Ger.
And draw all my servants in my bow, and keep my counsel, and tell me tales, and put me riddles, and read on a book sometimes when I am busy, and laugh at country gentlewomen, and command anything in the house for my retainers; and care not what you spend, for it is all mine; and, in any case, be still a maid, whatsoever you do, or whatsoever any man can do unto you.

Sec.
I warrant your Ladyship for that.

Ger.
Very well; you shall ride in my coach with me into the country, to-morrow morning. — Come, knight, pray thee let's make a short supper, and to bed presently.

Sec.
Nay, good madam, this night I have a short supper at home waits on his Worship's acceptation.

Ger.
By my faith, but he shall not go, sir; I shall swoon an he sup from me.

Pet.

Thought that they'd make her beautiful and they did
One supposes

Douglas Fairbanks, he was so handsome
He wore a moustache
Must-a had much cash, too
Worth a king's ransom

Charlie Chaplin, he was invited
When these artists became united
When these artists became united

David Griffith worked as an extra
Then as a stagehand
Until they let him be
A director

Dave was brave, a mover and shaker
A true pioneer
He seemed to show no fear
A real film maker

Just like Chaplin, he was invited
When these artists became united

EPIC RAP BATTLES OF POKEMON
CREEPY BLACK
VS
LOST SILVER
BEGIN!

[Verse 1: Lost Silver]
I'M DEAD, I want to live to spit this curse at you
Turn back now or you'll be sent to your doom
Cyndaquil says ""HURRY"" 'cause this GHOST will be Unown
I'll leave you in chains like the Pokémon I own
The forgotten hero haunts this spawn of Lavender Town
This is the battle of your life. The run option's not allowed
LEAVE, or it'll be your soul that I pilfer
In this battle of horrors, you'll take second place silver

[Verse 2: Creepy Black]
Black's here to hack through your silver soul and brain
You think you'll win? Man, the word ""Lost"" is in your name
GHOST is in your party, the Lavender Town sprite spirit
I'll curse you first, even though in Generation 1, that move wasn't in it
You can't stеp to me. Hell, you can't step at all
Can't catch this brawling ghost insidе a Pokéball
You're too scared to move. You're about to get owned
And on the place I finish you off, there'll stand a tombstone
You might also like[Verse 3: Lost Silver]
NOMORE, Your raps are giving me FRUSTRATION
You can't K.O. me! This will be my domination
Celebi will sing a Perish Song and have our Pain Split
Your data will be erased! REST IN 8 BITS

[Verse 4: Creepy Black]
Don't be giving me that Mean Look, or I'll use my Curse ability
You're Lost, Silver, when you come up against me
I murder every trainer I face. Don't even bother to fight
It's time to put you to sleep, 'cause this is your very last night

[Verse 5: BRVR]
Do you love me? If not, I'll use my thunderbolt
I know you'll never leave once I catch your souls
It's so cold down here, but my rhymes are so hot
Like what my owner did to me, I'll leave you all to ROT
You don't know the pain that's going in my chest
All of you were lying to me when you said your disses were the best
I'd rather die than listen to your lame excuses of raps
When you see my plushy in the room, it'll end in a BLOODBATH

[Verse 6: Buried Alive]
Let me come out from the ground and make you stop your strife
My time to shine and finally rip apart your lives
It's over, Pikachu, Nowhere to run and nowhere to hide
'Cause all you flee in fright when BURIEDALIVE wants to fight
Won't be tame when I've glitched your game, you're lame, will never be saved
'Cause my claim to fame: taking jokes like you to your graves
Finally, fresh meat, I've been waiting almost a century
You've reached the final floor! Now it's time to get BURIED
[Verse 7: Missingno.]
The true killer king has arrived to break your demise
No one will be missing you when I make you all di-I-I-I-I-I-I-e
Your pants, you'll be splitting when Missingno.'s spitting
These lyrics were written in the blood that's dripping
From your quitting, barely living heads since I'm hitting and ripping
There's missing-no way you'll win versus this verbal ass-kicking
Time's ticking, and ticking, and I'm winning, and grinning
I'm the glitching killing forbidden beginning of your spine-splitti-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-ing

[Verse 8: Strangled Red]
I have no reason to be here, but I'll take you all down anyways
You guys thinking you're the best has driven me even more crazed
In a world that cheated me, why should I play fair?
Just like me when Miki died, you'll all be driven to despair
I'll kill you all, I'm gonna do it, you don't wanna know what's going in my mind
This win is MINE, your guys' victory is something you can't find
Nothing can be saved now, prepare your necks, I'll strangle you all, there won't be a reset
When you step up to me, you'll end up dead, with the last thing you see is the color of red

[Verse 9: White Hand]
I can't believe you think that you all understand
You're nothing, but at least now you're in my hand
Crashing through this battle, rapping 'till you faint from this happening
Taking over your game 'cause your bodies aren't the only thing I'm hacking
Trust me, you'll be missing with no one to find the remains
All of you are fighting for supremacy, but your rapping's the same
Make all the noises you want. It'll prove to be futile
When I rip you into pieces, you'll know I made this battle BRUTAL
[Verse 10: Hypno's Lullaby]
Come with me, little children, Safe and happy you'll all be
As you rest in your beds and I DEVOUR ALL YOUR DREAMS
Don't cry, it's fine. Hypno wouldn't hurt a fly
Fortunately, all of you are NON-INVERTEBRATE SLIME
Got to Hand it to you, White. At least you proved you aren't the worst
Because Missingno. blew for every second of his verse
Hypno lied to you all. Sorry, now you're dead and done
Stay with me forever, we'll have so much fun

[Verse 11: Lavender Town Syndrome]
Come and listen to my song, I'll make all your ears bleed
You'll all be suicidal in this battle, don't believe me?
Step out of the cave, into the town and feel my power
More fearsome than the ghost of Marowak who haunts this tower
Any child who plays with me will end up being dead and severed
I'll corrupt all of you, showing you who should be feared
You think you're scary? I've got zombie Pokémon on my side
Challenging me to a battle? Better get ready to hide

[Verse 12: Ash's Coma]
I leave my home, start my journey all alone
No...(I'll catch 'em all) No... (Number one) I'll leave YOU all in a coma
Your theories aren't eerie. They're ethereal diseases
I'm the leader, and I'll turn you into Ash for your treason
(Listen!) My vision's blurry...(Stop! Pikachu!) I can't see...
I thought we were all a team. Maybe this is just a dream
Your existence is fiction. You'd rather hurt than feel hurting
Time to show you what I've learned on my Pokémon journey
Stage 1: Strike you with a bolt of lightning in my pocket
(Pikachu!) Stage 2: Ignite your fire and blast you like Team Rocket
Stage 3: Water Gun you down with flows you can't test
Stage 4: Make new friends and become the very best
If this is all in my head, sprawled in a hospital bed
Then I'm forever indebted to recycle the REM
Come on, You pasta peoples can't quite catch up!
Well, this battle is done, so let me pull the plug

[Outro]
Who Won?
Who's Next?

(*Birds chirping*)

(*Someone's snoring*)

(*Sample of Alarm Clock's Ringing*)
Awww shit!!

[The D.O.C.]
Here we go, here we go

[Dr. Dre as a radio host]
Wake your motherfucking ass up
This is Radio Station KM.G, 187 on your dial
And what I want you to do is tune in at 5 O'clock and listen to the homeboys
Total K-oss and Go-Mack, they'll gonna be rocking them big ol bitches on the traffic Jam
Next stop be your music right after these messages

[Skit: Commercial by white boy]
""Are you tired of looking whack?
""Do you wanna look cool?""
""Are you tired of people being in your business?""
""Well, you need not worry again, get some locs""
""That's right, some locs""
""For the amazingly low price of $4.99""
You might also like""Now, available at your nearest South Central liquor store""

[Dr. Dre as a radio host]
Yeah, this Radio station KM.G
And whenever you wanna hear some funky shit, put your dial on 187
Now, some new music by some homeboys out of South Central
Here's A.T.L., and they called this one livin' like hustlers

[Cold 187Um]
Let me start it off, cause I'm a player
Fade into part two, I'm the number one hoe layer
A mack, a player and a pimp
Something much stronger than your average drink
Now, correct me if I'm wrong, I'm like moonshine
Take a sip of my rhyme and I'll take over your mind
Cause I don't think like the average thinker
Call me the nightstalker or your neighborhood head shrinker
187 is like a megablast
I take too many names, I kick too much ass

[KM.G]
KM.G, the number one mack daddy
Eating chicken like a motherfucker, rolling in my Caddy
With my brim cold bent to the side, I bump and slide
Go-Mack in the back, 187 to the side
Street Pilgrims, pioneering the land
Above the Law status, with a gat in my hand
A mind designed like Frank Nitty
Living large on the Mic, doing damage for the city
The city of toners, which is known as L.A
Where the hustlers hustle and the ballers play
We got the dope beats from the homeboy Dre
And it had to be done (How?) the Ruthless way
187, what's up?
What do we do at our show?
[Cold 187Um]
We wear black on black with the Locs and the Romeos
Start stepping, unload my Mic weapon
We say it's fitting, you think it's hitting
K.M.G means Knowledge Most Greatly
Some people like me, most people hate me
In other words, I kick my gift
Do you be sleeping, KM.G?
No, I don't drift
I lounge or lay, cause suckers take advantage
Yo, what do we do to them?
Yo, we're doing damage
Cause we not punks, fools, sissies, or busters
And the way that we live.. is like hustlers

[Hook: Dr. Dre]
AWWWWWWWoow
Ooohh Lord, living like a hustler
Ooohh Lord, living like a hustler

[Cold 187Um]
I used to sell big llello on the block
That when all the hardheads, gain on hard knocks
I started with Gs and then I moved to keys
And at this point my life went with ease
In other words, my pockets was thick
I didn't worry about the Feds, I was checking the mitt
Pull a swoop to Farouk, got dressed to please
Got the crib pimped out so that the bitches flee
I bought a ride, ""what Kind?""
A white Corvette
So I can do a ghost move when it's time to jet
[KM.G]
When I was nineteen, I was on my own
Hooked up big connections on my mobile phone
At home, or maybe on my person
To clock big Gs, I'd be definitely certain
To live the lifestyle, the luxury, the freaks, the thrills
Yo, you was living kind of large, man
On the real, deals was being made
Suckers was getting sprayed
In other words, we was getting paid
Like hustlers

[Hook: Dr. Dre]
AWWWWWWWoow
Ooohh Lord, living like a hustler
Ooohh Lord, living like a hustler

[Cold 187Um]
Let me proceed, cause I got the green light
For the numero uno 87, it must be hype
For now, let me lay the cards on the table
So you can figure out who's worried or stable
I max and tax and relax and stack Gs
Stick that to the facts, that's why I crack them with ease
Please, get off the convoy, I think you're confused
When you cross, I told you you'd get tossed, and you lose
Now, A-B-O-V-E L-A-W, to some people
Yo, that spells trouble
But we're not a group promoting violence
But when it comes to speaking the real, I won't be silent
Speak all reality when I'm on the Mic
So you don't have to run and have a stereotype
See, see cause stereotypes will make you dumb
So kick back and listen, yo, to the knowledge that's grump

[KM.G]
See, the law has provided me, the KM.G
That's complex with the style but done easily
Pitch a bitch if I have to, you know why?
I'm undercover doing dirt, I'm a hell of a spy
Now numero 187 is a detonator, deadly than a hand grenade
Much harder than a fool to fade
Not a Forty, not a Quart or a Six-pack
Me, K.M.G, Total Kaos, and Go-Mack
Cause I unload my weapon with force
Yeah, I'm never detected, I leave respected
As a baller, a player or a pimp
Yo, pass me the forty, I commence to dent

[Cold 187Um]
A sissy soft sucker with no title
Unplug the machine, 187 is vital
Like a Beretta, with a mega clip
With a silencer on it, with the hollow point tip
But that is our business, on that we won't dwell
We make records for you to learn: Listen and Tell
Tell your mammas, tell a friend, tell a fool or a jerk
Tell them KM.G people it's time to put in some work
Like Hustlers

[Hook: until fade]
Woooo haaaa
Oooh Lord, living like a hustler
Oooh Lord, living like a hustlerEmbed"

Crescent Heights city, yeah, that’s where I’m from
A gang of wild-ass niggas that don’t back down to run
And supposed to perpetrate on bustas that we putting it down
These so-called L.A. fools that ain’t nowhere to be found
I see you throwing up the “W,” but yo, I’m here to trouble you
Of what you listening to-1-3, and that’s 3-1-0, not 3-1-3, so get it right…
Bust it… yo, we makin’ dope like Hoover and Pico, move slow
Be polite and everything’ll be alright, despite what other niggas say
Yo, this where it at, them other West Coast faggots, yo, where they at?
Word to MC Ren, I showed them people that you wack
Peace to the real crews defacing walls on backstreets
In the city of set, porch, halls, and swap meets
From the school of hard knocks, the generation passed down
Kaiser Permanente, yo, that’s where I was found
In the middle of the funk era, 'fros and dashikis
Pops was putting it down, chilling at the speakeasy
Now I’m posting at Unity with the b-boy stance (word!)
Take a glance and keep walking, yo, you know who it is
I’m from the motherfucking hardest-working group in show biz
If your shit ain’t humping right, don’t even bring it this way
You get booed off the stage, leaving town the next day
Telling your boys, “It is aight, better luck next time
The only thing that was cool: the weed, women, and sunshine”
Forgot to look under the stairs, yo, much more to boast about
Trying to diss and get that ass knocked out

Next to pine trees, blowing in the Santa Ana breeze
My DJ’s got fame, underground Rick Dees
I am MC, so bring in funk in five minutes
I jam like the 110 in the ‘84 Olympics
Keep the rhyme moving like the Unity location
Rap has been my vocation
Since before the Japanese owned the radio station
That’s why they Fired Jay Thomas
I keep it fattened like the llama, yo, I promise
Never stop, never change, like the price at Dodger Stadium
I blow up, rock free shows at the Palladium
Afterwards, the crew I’m taking ‘em to Tommy’s Burgers
Gotta be for every Los Angelino Murder
A rhyme for every burglar, Thes a well-worder
It comes together in a freeway like East LA merger
That means you’ll get no pay, but I urge you
Keep ya eye on L.A. like Chuck Henry, word
You heard of someone better? Send ‘em our way

Thes serve more wack MCs than waitresses at Roscoe’s
You know me, at the graveyard shift, gettin spliffed
We can take it downtown like Figueroa and 5th
And after that, I’m heading up to El Cholo for some dinner
Bustin’ through the inner-city underground like the red line
Thinner than the line at car wash in El Niño
That’s you son, see no time in this locale
Underground, down, talking ‘bout, “Yo, I’m keepin it real!”
I’m coming with the Walkman and tapes, not steel
Not a .22, .45, but a 9, Double O, 6
Put it on your letter to the better, lick a stamp, send it
And mail a letter to Thes, L.A. legend like Fernando Valenzuela
Yes, he never ran in a battle, yes
He be smoking beedis, watching the sun set from Sunset

[Double K]
Ay-yo, we got rappers walking around, shook like earthquakes
Blame it on San Andreas, it was a fault you had to wait
To grab the steel, how you feel? Ain’t even got skills to represent
The City of Angels, my whole team is heaven sent
Getting shit accomplished, yo, check the way we rock this
Like the Raiders in ‘88, fool, you can’t stop us
Like gang-banging, this shit’ll be banging for centuries
Imperial groups spreading like bank robberies
Over the Southland, we put the funk in your trunk
To bump hard, like 808s, sorry you had to wait
But we was digging in the crates, no fear, it’s here
Shady like MacArthur Park, don’t get caught after dark
Might never come back, see, sometimes it’s like that
Some niggas carry a gat, some niggas use their head
But the smartest of the smartest’ll still come out dead
It’s true it ain’t where you’re from, it’s where you’re at
But you’ll still get caught up wearing the wrong colored-hat
And on that note, everybody shut the fuck up and kick it
Spliffted, whatever you do, make sure you don’t miss it
‘Cause we coming like the end, yo, it’s just about wax
So watch out, we bringing bad luck like Wilshire and Fairfax
And it’s just like that, so check it out…

Till he appeared and the world felt its worth

A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn

Fall on your knees
Oh hear the angel voices
Oh night divine

Led by the light of faith serenely beaming
With glowing hearts by his cradle we stand
So led by a light of a star sweetly gleaming
Here come the men from the orient land

Combat ready for war at any second
Kinda like Randy Couture, I'm never second
When I throw the hands they back against the ropes
Guess they don't understand that they have no hope
'Cuz I float like a plane and sting like a needle
That's stuck in your veins, I'mma leave you there bleeding
Leave you there needing the help of first aid
And that is how I always end in first place
Uh, but I'm never really in a fight
The only time I throw a punch is if it's in a punchline
The only time I battle is against another rapper
If I feel like he's attacking then I will just throw it back in his face
And then obliterate, I can do it any time just pick any date
Im fighting like its Tyson hiding right in my skin
Anonymous decision anytime that I win
Only if I can't get the knockout blow in
Boy I'm a fighter whenever I'm flowing

[Hook]
Fighter, punchlines, tryna please the judges
On the stage, we perform in front of hundreds
Fighter, always ready to scrap at any time
So I guess everyone else should run and hide
Fighter, go through heavy training to prepare
Getting bulked up so opposition is scared

And that champion's belt is what I keep

From my blows, yeah you just about lost this
'Cuz if this a game then I'm the boss level

Your situations dire, can barely stay awake or
Block my hits until your out cold
And that's champions belt is what I hold
So before you start a fight you better get a clue

K-mel,Pictures on a Video Screen,"6 ContributorsNymphos Lyrics[Lil' Wayne:]
Weezy Baby
Now I'm the type of nigga that be up in the studio faithfully
She ain't tripping, she wait for me
I tell her, when I get a break, I'ma break her off so courageously
I got them banging drums, she got them Alicia keys
Ooh girl let's make a beat, ooh, girl, you make me weak
Like every time the track break
Make the control room boom like a 808
And if you walk your thong into this vocal booth
I can guarantee I'ma make this song all about you
And you know I got that drank, you know I got that stank
It's amazing how I think, and I do, so
And every time I meet a girl, she tell me that she sing
And I say I got a house with a studio
I'm just tryna do my thing, baby, video or audio
Shawty, I'm so smooth, I go everywhere that water go
Ooh, so bad, so mean
Make me wrap your ass up like a hot sixteen
And I promise you ain't wanna hear nobody else flow
Welcome to my studio, you gon' love my studio

[2Pac:]
Now I could make miracles with tempos
It's instrumental
Waitin for the nymphos
That's the intro
Shook when ya rushed me
You walked up and touched me
Why? Do you want to f**k me?
Just cause I'm paid in the worst way... True
Lookin kinda good in your birthday suit
I wonder if your wild or ya act shy
Do you like to be on top or the back side?
Watch when you lick your lips, shake your hips
Goddamn, I love that shit
Now let's stop fake gimme real now
I got a room and a hard on, Still down?
Met ya standin at a bar full of black dudes
Said ya wanna see my scars and my tatooes
When we head for my hideout, act right
Boss playa when I ride out, that's right

Tell Me Why Do We Live This Way

K-mel,Plague of Love,"4 ContributorsPlague of Love Lyrics[Verse 1]
My father is a doctor, he never told me
About this problem that I've got
I've never had it, it feels awful
It must be something that I caught

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't breathe, I can't eat
I hallucinate in my sleep
I get a fever whenever you're near
Oh, God, it's suddenly clear

[Chorus]
Ooh, struck down by the plague of love
Sweet poison running through my blood
And I can't bear not knowing if you even care

[Verse 2]
My mother is a nurse, she can't help me
Though she spent her life in the service of others
I told her 'bout my pain, but she was busy
Downstairs serving dinner for my brother

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I can't get out of bed
I've got this crazy notion in my head
I hear a ghost in my bedroom lurking
Is it me or is the medicine working?

K-mel,Plane Song,"3 ContributorsPlane Song Lyrics[Verse 1]
The seats were all dusty, the side doors were open
Those aeroplanes were left there years ago
Granddad had spoken of forests in Russia
I pictured him walking in ten inches of snow

[Chorus]
We liked pretending those planes could fly
That nothing was out of reach in the whole of the sky
It was just pretending, simple to do
We'd make some plans and travel someplace new

[Verse 2]
Paris and London, those cities in movies
Perfect lives were lived if they could be believed
Back in the real world they seemed so distant
But none of it mattered in the aeroplane field

[Chorus]
We liked pretending those planes could fly
That rusty old wings knew the entire sky
It was just pretending, there was nothing more
Hey, why the sad face? Can't you feel this cabin soar?

Infamous up in this, you know how we get down
Is that yo' girl? She feelin' our style
We come through the spot real heavy on the waist
So when they wanna move, we put 'em in they place

(Prodigy)
Yo, I was schooled by the hood, raised by the wolves
Trained by the pain, adopted by guerrillas
Gotta tank for a car, ice for a arm
Got tattoos wit' skin and scars from brawls
Gotta buildin' for a crib, Manhattan for a backyard
Skyscraper ladies, they f**k me when they man gone
Kings of New York, I'm one of the few of those
Difficulties to come, it's gon' be funerals
You get a quiet spot in the shade, for a grave
I get paid, 'cause I got murder 'fore sixteen
And I'm so much rich, I got a condo for a piggy bank
So much stash, I just laugh at yo' face
Blow a stack on David, 'cause I'm a pyro
Maniac from carriage, wit' the Rolls Gold
I was told by the O.G.'s like my Pops
If you can't whip they a**, turn it up a lot (lot, lot)

Heavy bones on the deuce, flickin' it up in the mix
Fast forward to '06, gettin' fed in the '06
Have a chick, feelin' like she workin' out on that Bow-Flex
I'm focused, looked through my lens, see my vision
Surprise myself and came through without one spool missin'

Some knowing mind some guiding hand
Must have designed, must have planned it
You’re like a garden in a land
Of barren rock and lonely sand
Where rain can fall
Where grass can grow
And through it all, I can love you so
Isn’t it strange but it’s only a feeling
Isn’t it weird it feels like I’m stealing your soul?
Isn’t it wild, this world we know now?
You’re like a prayer I was scared to say
The one who might have got away
Somebody worth all I‘ve had to face
No one on earth could replace you

Here we go, here we go

[Dr. Dre as a radio host]
Wake your motherfucking ass up
This is Radio Station KM.G, 187 on your dial
And what I want you to do is tune in at 5 O'clock and listen to the homeboys
Total K-oss and Go-Mack, they'll gonna be rocking them big ol bitches on the traffic Jam
Next stop be your music right after these messages

[Skit: Commercial by white boy]
""Are you tired of looking whack?
""Do you wanna look cool?""
""Are you tired of people being in your business?""
""Well, you need not worry again, get some locs""
""That's right, some locs""
""For the amazingly low price of $4.99""

[Dr. Dre as a radio host]
Yeah, this Radio station KM.G
And whenever you wanna hear some funky shit, put your dial on 187
Now, some new music by some homeboys out of South Central
Here's A.T.L., and they called this one livin' like hustlers

[Cold 187Um]
Let me start it off, cause I'm a player
Fade into part two, I'm the number one hoe layer
A mack, a player and a pimp
Something much stronger than your average drink
Now, correct me if I'm wrong, I'm like moonshine
Take a sip of my rhyme and I'll take over your mind
Cause I don't think like the average thinker
Call me the nightstalker or your neighborhood head shrinker
187 is like a megablast
I take too many names, I kick too much ass

[KM.G]
KM.G, the number one mack daddy
Eating chicken like a motherfucker, rolling in my Caddy
With my brim cold bent to the side, I bump and slide
Go-Mack in the back, 187 to the side
Street Pilgrims, pioneering the land
Above the Law status, with a gat in my hand
A mind designed like Frank Nitty
Living large on the Mic, doing damage for the city
The city of toners, which is known as L.A
Where the hustlers hustle and the ballers play
We got the dope beats from the homeboy Dre
And it had to be done (How?) the Ruthless way
187, what's up?
What do we do at our show?
[Cold 187Um]
We wear black on black with the Locs and the Romeos
Start stepping, unload my Mic weapon
We say it's fitting, you think it's hitting
K.M.G means Knowledge Most Greatly
Some people like me, most people hate me
In other words, I kick my gift
Do you be sleeping, KM.G?
No, I don't drift
I lounge or lay, cause suckers take advantage
Yo, what do we do to them?
Yo, we're doing damage
Cause we not punks, fools, sissies, or busters
And the way that we live.. is like hustlers

[Hook: Dr. Dre]
AWWWWWWWoow
Ooohh Lord, living like a hustler
Ooohh Lord, living like a hustler

[Cold 187Um]
I used to sell big llello on the block
That when all the hardheads, gain on hard knocks
I started with Gs and then I moved to keys
And at this point my life went with ease
In other words, my pockets was thick
I didn't worry about the Feds, I was checking the mitt
Pull a swoop to Farouk, got dressed to please
Got the crib pimped out so that the bitches flee
I bought a ride, ""what Kind?""
A white Corvette
So I can do a ghost move when it's time to jet
[KM.G]
When I was nineteen, I was on my own
Hooked up big connections on my mobile phone
At home, or maybe on my person
To clock big Gs, I'd be definitely certain
To live the lifestyle, the luxury, the freaks, the thrills
Yo, you was living kind of large, man
On the real, deals was being made
Suckers was getting sprayed
In other words, we was getting paid
Like hustlers

[Hook: Dr. Dre]
AWWWWWWWoow
Ooohh Lord, living like a hustler
Ooohh Lord, living like a hustler

[Cold 187Um]
Let me proceed, cause I got the green light
For the numero uno 87, it must be hype
For now, let me lay the cards on the table
So you can figure out who's worried or stable
I max and tax and relax and stack Gs
Stick that to the facts, that's why I crack them with ease
Please, get off the convoy, I think you're confused
When you cross, I told you you'd get tossed, and you lose
Now, A-B-O-V-E L-A-W, to some people
Yo, that spells trouble
But we're not a group promoting violence
But when it comes to speaking the real, I won't be silent
Speak all reality when I'm on the Mic
So you don't have to run and have a stereotype
See, see cause stereotypes will make you dumb
So kick back and listen, yo, to the knowledge that's grump

[KM.G]
See, the law has provided me, the KM.G
That's complex with the style but done easily
Pitch a bitch if I have to, you know why?
I'm undercover doing dirt, I'm a hell of a spy
Now numero 187 is a detonator, deadly than a hand grenade
Much harder than a fool to fade
Not a Forty, not a Quart or a Six-pack
Me, K.M.G, Total Kaos, and Go-Mack
Cause I unload my weapon with force
Yeah, I'm never detected, I leave respected
As a baller, a player or a pimp
Yo, pass me the forty, I commence to dent

[Cold 187Um]
A sissy soft sucker with no title
Unplug the machine, 187 is vital
Like a Beretta, with a mega clip
With a silencer on it, with the hollow point tip
But that is our business, on that we won't dwell
We make records for you to learn: Listen and Tell
Tell your mammas, tell a friend, tell a fool or a jerk
Tell them KM.G people it's time to put in some work
Like Hustlers

[Hook: until fade]
Woooo haaaa

Another album that's fittin to shoot straight up the charts
Number one videos straight to ""106""
Every suburban middle American gonna be bumpin this
See I'm real, don't worry I got it on lock
When the boy wonder's around, I shut down shop
Huh, rapper slash, actor slash
I cause total chaos, I got it in a smash
Homie ain't nobody hotter, told you that I'm back
And I'm goin back for the whole enchilada, you got it

At times i can’t sleep cause my dreams too loud
Mama i hope you looking from the heaven and you proud
Even though i fail all i ever do is try

I wonder if my time will come
I wonder if i'll ever see the sun go down
So the stars can shine / But i still believe great things take time

Verse 1

All i ever wanted was to go big
Show up at a party and they know me
I don't hate rich kids dammit
Spending daddy money , we be yelling eat dammit
Thina siyazenzela , 21 no more cela
Indoda iyaziphandela k'mele uthole into ongayifela
Homies on that crazy talk my tv on E
Pillow on my face they don't wanna see me breathe
I'm just a broke artist with a rich picture
You don't wanna stop claiming till the heat hit ya
I reach a , golden dream with my broke nigga hands
Even the paralyzed always had a dream to dance
Chorus

All i ever wanted was to go big
My name on your head / Face on the magazine
Being born broke made me wanna get it all
I never played sports so i don't know how to ball
Nobody wanna mess with a born broke
Born broke
Nobody wanna mess with a born broke
Born broke

Verse 2

Cause being born broke is the worst though
I’ve been on this feeling for a while it ain’t nice jo
Mammies they don't wanna mess with you nah boy
Walking in the mall looking at the things you can’t afford
Story of a youngin living ekasi
Before he got to Joburg he was living Emlazi
Saw the kasi life / Rich kids blowing money
Drinking out the bottle and surrounded by them mommies
He wanted that life so bad , He would kill for it
Started making new friends that will lead to it
Plans didn't work out / Parents didn't help
No money to eat at home , He just wanted swagger
You gotta work for what you want / Yeah mama said it
I'm on that hustle everyday praying that i get it
Cause people they never around when you ain’t got none
But after the riches they be sending accounts
Chorus

All i ever wanted was to go big
My name on your head / Face on the magazine
Being born broke made me wanna get it all
I never played sports so i don't know how to ball
Nobody wanna mess with a born broke
Born broke
Nobody wanna mess with a born broke
Born broke

K-mel,Spider’s Web,"5 ContributorsSpider’s Web LyricsIf a black man is racist, is it okay
If it's the white man's racism that made him that way
Because the bully's the victim they say
By some sense they're all the same

'Cause the line between wrong and right
Is the width of a thread from a spider's web
The piano keys are black and white
But they sound like a million colors in your mind

I could tell you to go to war
Or I could march for peace and fighting no more
How do I know which is right
And I hope he does when he sends you to fight

'Cause the line between wrong and right
Is the width of a thread from a spider's web
The piano keys are black and white
But they sound like a million colors in your mind

Should we act on a play
Or should we chase the moments away
Should we live, should we give
Remember forever the guns and the feathers in time

'Cause the line between wrong and right
Is the width of a thread from a spider's web

Some call it guidance from above

I said clap your hands to the beat, to the beat
Uh huh and you don't stop
Uh huh and you don't stop
Uh huh and you don't stop
We in this Great Lakes state
Eatin steaks 'n shrimp
It's kinda hard to miss the crew
Because we all got limps
We come equipped with new kicks and stetsons
The super saggy rags and the white trash connection
No flexin, huh, know what I mean
You can feel us fool, we don't need to be seen
It's all about the green, not the drugs we be takin
That shits free with an LP in circulation
And we be wastin time
Got them all state, all county, all hood rhymes
It's all good times, thank the lord
For dumb f**kin people and credit card fraud
We're tearin up your lawn, we got herds of Lincolns
Step into your crib and have your whole house stinkin
Don't blink and don't think we're soft
Hide your money and your gold and don't express your thoughts
We get mad props, wreck all shops
Puttin stops on crews
They get confused and lose, that's what we do
Styles stem from pioneers
Leavin suckers in awe
And you get jawed for lookin queer
Can you hear me or am I talkin to the wall
That's Top Dog callin out each and every one of y'all
You get balls, you come and talk that shit
But Top Dogs camp ain't nothin to f**k with
And don't say we didn't warn ya
I got this Detroit thang with more love that California
Drunk DJ smokin coiniac dips
Call me the sidekick, thug boy, kid with the limp
I rip through rhymes like a bullet in the breeze
And I float through tracks like a shark in the sea
A wee bit shy, but I comply by me
And I'm a mean mother f**ker when I have to be
Got young g's with sleeves and thieves on hold
Strategically placed in case somebody feels bold
I told...you ho's you can't f**k with these cause
I make more papers then trees
See we believe in brotherhood forever is criteria
You f**kin with Top Dog
Your f**kin with family
No I ain't feelin ya, got all that I can do to hear

You can get your life took tryin to take my pride
You ride with who, man that shit ain't big
I roll with dogs that'll rock your wig
And got gigs all money

Cellular receivers and beepers is what were sportin
Your nothin of importance, I don't sweat you
Yeah the drinks on me, but the jokes on you
I'm all about the everyday nothin at all
See I'm not doin very much, I'm just havin a ball
I'm in bed by four, I'm up by noon
I might sit around, I might write me a tune
I might go fishi' and again I might not
I might get me a fourty or pour me some scotch
The watch on my wrist, that don't even exist
A lot of pissed people from appointments that I've missed
I dissed everybody and their mom for spite
Cause everybody's barkin, but nobody ever bites
Your talkin loud, sayin nothin
Get you dad, get your cousin
Go and get your boy cause he's as big as a house
Now take your pussy ass click and get the f**k out
I'm the estranged, deranged, I got domains like states
I live in plush hotels with them hourly rates
I do big plates eight times a day
The crew be livin large at the seafood bay
Got a way with the world and now I'm lookin' to scramble
Ain't about to ass out on a no good gamble
Could handle anything, but I ain't down for broke
So before somebody slides, somebody's getting choked
I'm a no good freak, tweak skin like rashes
I lose a little love with everyday that passes
Ain't a masotistic, rock statistics, vocabulary
I'm a very shy simplistic
And get this, some people say I changed
I'm the same mother f**ker with the same old name
A little extra game and extra cash could see
You could f**k me, but don't put it past me
You wanna bash me and got no reason
I can lay up in the Caymans for four straight seasons
I ain't a punk, I refuse to be
I live for what is, not what used to be
Your all up in the past, that's ass
Hear what I say

K-mel,The Flood,"5 ContributorsThe Flood Lyrics[Verse 1]
Broken people get recycled
And I hope that I will
Sometimes we're thrown off our pathways

What I thought was my way home
Wasn't the place I—

No, I'm not afraid of changing
I'm certain nothing's certain
What we own becomes our prison
My possessions will be gone
Back to where they came from

[Chorus]
Blame
No one is to blame
As natural as the rain that falls
Here comes the flood again

[Verse 2]
See the rock that you hold onto
Is it gonna save you?
When the earth begins to crumble
Why do you feel you have to hold on?
Imagine if you let go

[Chorus]
Blame
No one is to blame
As natural as the rain that falls
Here comes the flood again

[Bridge]
Wash away
The weight that pulls you down
Ride the waves
That free you from your doubtsWash
Away
The weight
That pulls you down

Ride
The waves
That free
You from your doubts

Blame
No one is to blame
As natural as the rain
Here comes the flood againDon't trust your eyes
It's easy to believe them
Know with your heart
That you can leave your prison

Don't trust your mind
It's not always listening
Turn on the lights
And feel the ancient rhythm

Don't trust your eyes
It's easy to believe them
Know in your heart
That you can leave your prison[Chorus]
Blame
No one is to blame
As natural as the rain that falls
Here comes the flood againEmbed"

This is on some Cash Rules Everything Around Me type thought
Yo bust it yo, yo
We was chillin on the ave, buggin out lookin dap
And these four cold boys rolled up in a cab
They pulled out a tool, said get against the wall
F' that, I'd rather brawl than to go out at all
My man pushed back *blaow* he pulled the trigger
Nah G not on Sin, that's my main nigga
His body hit the floor, blood covered the ground
How that sound? I didn't even get my last pound
The red glare with his tears made me shed
Now I'm fed, my right hand man could be dead
Hell no, I couldn't let em flee that ain't me
Or how me and my crew lounge and be
So we dash with a rugged child on his ass
In the grass his life is now come to pass
The fam made him trip, aww shit the gun slip
My man picked up the burner and emptied the clip
In his back, no slack jack, with sound to retreat back
Wipe the gat and pack it in a napsack
Yo be out cause 5-0 is soon to come
You get arrested and bagged for murder one
I'm in the house with Bishop, The RZA, The GZA
Represent kid you know how it goes dizza

Set it right here from the beginning? Aiiight bet check it

I make a rugged bloody spectacle
Technical feast where beats hits like a kick to your testicles
Niggas remind me of vegetables
So I'mma stir fry your brain like the incredible edible
Egg, I got mad CREAM between bread
Rip it on, pass the bone, let's get stoned like Fred
Flintstone when I roam boy it's evident
We only puff on the leafs with the ganja scent
I be the mean black gugger bust a slug in your mug
Watch the blood overflood your head like beer suds
The temple that I am in I gots the mental rhymin
While chumps try to pump the styles of Simple Simon
I be The RZA, yo I gets bizza with my lizza
Here be my nizza, The GZA
Live in effect on KMEL boy

[The Genius/GZA]
Yeah, and you don't stop yo
Callin all cars, callin all cars, lyrical psycho
Armed and dangerous, leavin mad scars on those
Who are found bound, gagged and shot
While I blast the spot niggas took off like astronauts
Difficult see even your best can't come on down
You're the next contestant
Get your non-lyrical rhymin ass a spankin
I'm catchin wreck, gettin more respect than Aretha Franklin
Avenue and Putnam, the rhyme wreckin center
Bacardi and Rum through those cold days of winter
I used to warm up the cipher with a rhyme that was hyper
Than your average JFK sniper
So yo yo, don't even start it
I roll like Kaufmann, lay that ass out like carpet
25 rhymes a square yard
I hit em so hard he wake up sayin ""That wasn't even fair God""
Stop the stutterin boy, save your place for the 5-0
Then praise the lord you're alive bro
I release stacks, you premeditate the grab
You couldn't catch it so you bounce back to your lab
Just to look for what, wack rhymes you couldn't finish
Yeah, I know forgot to eat your spinach
Here's a can, for those who wanna sleep, pills
Cold snorin while they slept on my deep skills
That originated back in Shaolin, an endangered island
Shorties losin blood by the gallons
[Shyheim]
Yo I gotta go after that boy
After The GZA then we go to a commercial whatever y'all wanna do
Check it, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
You better look out kid cause I'm the Wu-Tang's smallest artist
When I come through niggas be jettin like I'm narcotics
I'm the shorty of the bus but yet I hit the hardest
When I rolled upon your squad you showed me where your heart is
You start to snitch like a bitch cold droppin dimes
I cut that ass short like a tree of alpine
But I'm a lumberjack black and a matter of fact
I flip that track like 2 kilos of crack packs
I lit up quick like a 4-fifth automatic
Who got static, like Spike Lee I gotta have it
I gave it to your ass raw like a proud faggot
I keep it movin like I did on my first LP
I stay true to the grain of G.P
Word to my mother I can never be a sucker
I die hard too, yippie-ki-yay muthafuckerEmbed"
K-mel,The One I Love Is Gone,"4 Contributors1632 Lyrics[Verse 1]
I remember it was hard in the pits with my dawgs
Made it out with scars, that's a kiss from the gods
Gold drip on my wrist look like piss on my arm
My pinky ring bling make you ring your alarm
Know some scammers with the cards who think sin is a fraud
If you let 'em in then they pimpin' your broad
Money make them spin like the rims on a car
For the money, kill your kin leavin' skin in the tar
You not rich if you trip over tips at bar
You rich if your kids kids kids got a farm
A bitch nigga chin needs a fist not a palm
When you niggas RIP you not missed where you from
And when you dead and gone they might sing you a song
Did your mama wrong, she can't bring you along
Now she missing your charm
Calm while you trimming her lawn
At Avalon and she is picking your plants (Hela heh)
Majita  ba ko Ivory can strip a car quick
His girl works at XO, the strippers arе thick
I went with my chick and she was all on my stick
In my ear said shе wish that she could swallow my kids
Never sleep with a girl you wouldn't father life with
A couple bones from my father gave my daughter my ribs
Pause, nigga really hard but they ain't hard as my clique
Spliffing with Zoocci so pardon my Piff
Amakhosi or a Pirate?
Amadlozi are not silent
In the land of the violence
In the sand we get diamonds
And every man is an island

Boiling the spud turned my oil into blood

The slugs in my gums turned my voice to a flood

You know I'm hearin' all these rumors out here bout
They ran $hort Dogg up outta East Oakland
Nigga moved to Atlanta, ain't got no mo' love in the town
I got much love in Oakland y'all, you know what I'm sayin'?
I been doin' this shit for years
So I'm a tell it to you just like it happened.... BITCH

[Verse 1]
I don't stop rappin
Ever since the very first day
I grabbed the microphone, made a funky ass tape
I had sixteen hoes
Suckin ten toes
Game from the ""O""
An any real pimp knows
The only love hoes get is what they paid fo
Gimme my scratch
What the fuck I'm a stay fo?
I gotta make moves bitch
Stack some G's
From the ho stroll
To my fax machine
I got money comin in from everywhere
From New York
To L.A.,
To the mutha fuckin Bay
It's true
I'm the man G
I'm underground 106 can't ban me
All on the air sayin they don't fuck wit me no mo
I go back wit rap like K-P-O-O
From the very first time I grabbed the mic
Niggas smokin burner
Ready to fight
I don't promote violence
I'm from Oakland where the real kick it
You might get killed nigga
Or make a mill ticket
Move down south cuz the town is wild
Now the radio jocks wanna clown my style

You mutha fuckaz gonna get it
It was thirteen G's all mine
Didn't give Ted & Rand one dime
Now listen real close cuz it might be
Hard to follow
Chris told Ted it was fifty thousand dollaz
Shit sound petty
An it is
But that's how it goes when you in show biz
Niggas fallin out
Should be makin millions
Instead of studios
We seein lawyers in buildings
Then we stop speakin
Shit got funky
I don't give a fuck
Mutha fucka get my money
I ain't never been a ho you can't pimp me
I do all the work while you pimp me

But right about then

Sold a car an a truck in Oakland fo that Lex
Jock loaned me five an I was rollin that bitch

Don't believe everything you hear nigga

[Verse 3]
I went to the freak-nik
Shit turned me out
Came back fo jack the rapper
Bought me a house
That was August '93 time to dip
I hade warrants in the town an I was hot as shit
Everytime I got stopped
Nigga went to jail
Treat me bad cuz I was hangin wit criminals
I wanted to buy me a house in the Oakland hills
Nice lil sumpthin fo a half a mill
That's was right around the time Chris hooked Dru Down
The Luniz came through an them tricks got clowned
Rappin Ron tore 'em up on the freestyle tip
An niggas ain't ran nobody outta shit
Then they put it on the town
Shit got real
When you was in the fourth grade I had a record deal
You got one hit record now you ballin
You make one fake album you'll be fallin
An that shit don't apply to me
Present or past
You can meet me at the mall an get my autograph
Or you can flash back
If you can do all that
Me Fred Benz
An Freddy Craps
Smokin burner upstairs in hot lips house
It's been fifteen years an I ain't played out

Seen a Cherokee started shootin at Spice
At the E-40 picnic out in the park
Niggas gather round fo some shit to start
They had bullets wit my name
But we never got to me

Shootin at the street

At times i can’t sleep cause my dreams too loud
Mama i hope you looking from the heaven and you proud
Even though i fail all i ever do is try
Sometimes i wonder God can hear me when i cry (sigh)
I wonder if my time will come
I wonder if i'll ever see the sun go down
So the stars can shine / But i still believe great things take time

Verse 1

All i ever wanted was to go big
Show up at a party and they know me
I don't hate rich kids dammit
Spending daddy money , we be yelling eat dammit
Thina siyazenzela , 21 no more cela
Indoda iyaziphandela k'mele uthole into ongayifela
Homies on that crazy talk my tv on E
Pillow on my face they don't wanna see me breathe
I'm just a broke artist with a rich picture
You don't wanna stop claiming till the heat hit ya
I reach a , golden dream with my broke nigga hands
Even the paralyzed always had a dream to dance
Chorus

All i ever wanted was to go big
My name on your head / Face on the magazine
Being born broke made me wanna get it all
I never played sports so i don't know how to ball
Nobody wanna mess with a born broke
Born broke
Nobody wanna mess with a born broke
Born broke

Verse 2

Cause being born broke is the worst though
I’ve been on this feeling for a while it ain’t nice jo
Mammies they don't wanna mess with you nah boy
Walking in the mall looking at the things you can’t afford
Story of a youngin living ekasi
Before he got to Joburg he was living Emlazi
Saw the kasi life / Rich kids blowing money
Drinking out the bottle and surrounded by them mommies
He wanted that life so bad , He would kill for it
Started making new friends that will lead to it
Plans didn't work out / Parents didn't help
No money to eat at home , He just wanted swagger
You gotta work for what you want / Yeah mama said it
I'm on that hustle everyday praying that i get it
Cause people they never around when you ain’t got none
But after the riches they be sending accounts
Chorus

All i ever wanted was to go big
My name on your head / Face on the magazine
Being born broke made me wanna get it all
I never played sports so i don't know how to ball
Nobody wanna mess with a born broke
Born broke
Nobody wanna mess with a born broke
Born broke

Outro

Cause being born broke is the worst though
I've been on this feeling for a while it ain't nice jo
Born broke

I'm writing this chilling in my room
Sipping on old buck thinking how far we done came
Now them homies close to the game
Look at us making a name

This is how we live going for the kill

Losing everything just for a win

K-mel,Turn to Tell,"5 ContributorsBad Day LyricsVerse

You told me to stop, You told me to listen
You told me to stop, the way I was living
You said to talk to you
I know that you're hot, I know I was distant
I'm working a lot
You always be bitching
I showed my flaws to you
Your phone was unlocked
I got so suspicious
It had me in shock
Your words to some prick
‘Cause he wrote some songs for you?
You been to his spot
You sent him some pictures
So the day that y’all went to eat, I just showed up at the meeting
Like, “What's up everybody!?”
I was drunk and ignorant
You had your mouth open, he looked like an idiot
And then he tried to play real innocent
Like, ""We just friends, just homies, just kicking it...""
""Word? How bout I kick you in your little d--k?""
Patted on my waist like, ""Do something!""
He didn't flinch
And you was crying like, ""Not here.""
So we went home. You was still letting out tears
Then you tried to say that I was really the blame for you hanging with this lame cause I was cheating for five years
Huh? You ain’t got no proof of that
Then you started naming names, and it threw me back
""So that's why you rolling with this doofy cat?""
Then you told me that all I do is rap
And you got mad
All of a sudden like out of nowhere
You showed me some flick of a chick like, ""Who's this ho here?""
I said, ""I recognize the panties and the bra
But the face got me stumped."" Damn
Why did I go there?
Hands in my grill, wild swinging haymakers
I busted you, how you gon’ change places?
Getting all mad, I tried to maintain you
I had to straight shake you
""Yo what the hell are you doing?""
Then I asked about the dude, ""what does he mean to you, what did y’all do?
This is our fortress, did he break through?
One wrong is bad, but tell me if there was...two?!""
Then you looked to the ceiling...
You can imagine my feeling
There's no emotional healing that could fix what went on with my heart when you revealed
That I was gone for a month and you felt like a dunce, cause he kept on trying to touch you and you always used to front
But he treated you to lunch
Then he treated you like dinner
When y’all laid down once, I was screaming
“What the f--k??..”
I tried to come and hug you...
You told me not to touch you...
The way you said you hate me, it was coming from the soul like plug two
There's potholes in my damn lawn
He told my girl come home with him like Cam'ron
You hit me with confessions of fire, I said you're lying, then you pushed me, you're mad strong
The first time you ever put hands on me, and then again
…And it happened so quick
You called me a selfish bitch, and I caught you in the lips
Open hand maybe ma it could have been a fist all I know is I was defending myself
You caught a fit
I never reacted violently
Never saw this side of me
Blame it on the liquor
God I wish I had a time machine
Take me back twenty-eight seconds and put my mind at ease
Or make me disappear, make me run away, make me try to leave
I was yelling sorry
I told you I was drinking
Things got a little foggy
Girl I wasn't thinking
I remember you saying, ""You think you’re a man?
You wanna be tough, you wanna throw hands?
Hit me again pussy
Yea I cheated, yea he was hitting it, yea he was eating,""
Then you got graphic, you said something ‘bout his mouth
And I saw myself choking you out
Where's God?...
We about to make the news
I thought this is what people deep in love do
My father used to yell, my mother would scream too
Throwing furniture, to hurt each other, I was left confused
Turned me to a lonely kid
Sometimes I would blame her, thought she kept provoking it
And he had to tame her
I ain't ever choke a chick
Until right now…
I backed up…
I calmed down
Damn, apologizing just sounds stupid
Tried to put the blame on too much Chris Brown music
Nah
Girl I thought that we found Cupid
He hit us with his arrow
Lord your eye is on the sparrow
So how did you not stop me from just flying off the handle?
I was worried ‘bout the booth
But I got demons fighting battles, and they're winning
I was spinning, now my mind is so unraveled
Girl I hate the man I showed you, now I hope my show gets canceled, like, it's like
I know you wanna leave me
But I hope you can believe me, it's a cycle when you see me
Look my father hit my mother. Seen my grandpa push my granny
Seen my cousin and my brother look, it's all up in the family
My genes make me do this
You clubbing every night, girl your Jeans make me do this
They hug you so tight
I feel like a heathen
We was beefing, but that beefing could easily turn to grieving when blood is dripping and leaking
I believe that I love you but
Love is never the reason for hitting someone its deep and I really don't know the meaning
Got my eyes wide shut I don't wanna see you leaving
I would rather you just wait ‘til I'm sleeping and then get even
I'm not sorry that I did it, I'm just honestly sorry I'm still breathing

Coming for everything they said that we would never have
Let's just remain humble, and never ever brag

We won't stop until we all win
And then we do it all over again

[Verse 1: Zakwe]
Yeah
This is music on a higher level
Watch me take it back to the surface
What's worse is, it's now for the internet where the surf is
It's now for the intellects that dumb it down so you get this
I know my current flow is electrifying the circus, word is
Black child you were born to be the greatest
Ng’yazi k’nzima ukuyiqala kepha asi-focus-e kuma-endings
Ideas I pitch are worthy, I'm never nervous
I’m always gonna pitch whenever sibanika umpentshisi
Yeah
That's a fruitful thought I'm ready to serve it
Ngihlanganisa amagama like I'm writing in cursive
Verses that I lace are never found under curtains
And angizwani nok’ngcola I'm not the one to be messed with
I'm a survivor ngiphusha kumnyama kubovu
Ngiy' guerrilla elifel'empini soze ngixakwe amagovu
Since way way way back islonda asikakapholi
Yith abantu abamnyama kanti yithi futh' abampofu
Kumele kwehle itofu
So, darky beka phansi intshiza
Sith' ukubambana ngezandla uy'gazi lami ngyak'feel-a
K'mele siziqhenye ngobuthina singahlekani makubhimba
Since black is a color like the predicament years
Wekhanda shisa mak'njena ungalinge ungivimbe
Ushove iqupha phezulu mhla sekubuya lelizwe
Yeaah, I'm black but don't get it twisted
I might be listed as black but I'm not blacklisted!

Hoping that I can be your favorite
And rated one of the greatest
And other people they hated
They slowly gettin' frustrated

And lookin' back from now, it's just safe to say I've upgraded
'cause I've always seen progression in everything I created
And all of y'all chicks I dated

And you surpassing my spot when I'm making hits with the gods?
Don't get involved, this just some innocent bars
Let you rappers giving up, why you just might witness the cards

K-mel,What I Miss About You,"15 ContributorsEazy-E LyricsAnd if I hit the switch I can make the assssss drop

[Verse 1]
Growing up they said the west had no lyricists
Can you imagine growing up hearing this?
So I took my hip hop serious
Years later now the pen game is Furious
Styles from a Boy-N-The-Hood
Post G-Funk Era trying to do good
What about Quik, and Dub C
King Tee, Eiht, Kurupt and Suga Free
They Master Ceremonies and they Move Crowds
See, I'm from the west coast and I'm so proud
This where crack started and yeah we act retarded
Niggas be scrapping in the parking lot at Target
It's fucked up, but it's kind of funny
And we be set tripping and it ain't over money
Red and blue is like Muslim and Jew
And I don't ever think they'll stop but I'm praying that they do
In '92 we had a truce for a little bit
Until they started back tripping over little shit
I was young making sense of this crazy world
And my childhood hero had a Jheri curl

[Hook]
When Eazy-E was playing on the radio
I knew exactly how my day would go
California sunshine coming in
Singing gangsta rap with all my friends
The origins of California hip hop
Where you can pop, lock, or you can get shot
Black, white, latin, asian, living in this melting pot
Throw up your W and it don't stop

My cousins up north they hit me to the game
It's all California, but we ain't all the same
To G's up there they had a different swag
They was grinding out the trunk getting hella cash
B-Legit man, E-40 dude
Del and Heiro got their start up under Cube
Love to my Bay Area fam
'93 Til Infinity is still the jam
And over 20 year later
They still rocking for the stoners and the skaters
I used to watch videos by Plan B
Dream about hitting up the Hubba Ledge or EMB
Shout out to Tommy G and Ray Barbee
Cause there ain't no party like a Bay Party
When Mac Dre died, I was brokenhearted
Show some love to where the independent game started
The 6-1-9, shout out to Jay-O
Masters Of The Universe, doing it in DayGo
I came up on drive-bys and chronic smoke
And it was hella crazy, but it was kinda dope

[Hook]
When Eazy-E was playing on the radio

[Verse 3]
It goes 6 In The Morning, police at my door
Fresh Adidas squeak across the bathroom floor
Ice was telling stories about an inner city war
He gave the world a taste and they came back for more
They said ""bitch"" and Fuck Tha Police
They said they'd never make a million talking about the streets
They said they'd never play it on the radio
Now all you hear is gangsta rap everyday and yo
We motherfucking pioneers
All of that shit started out right here
We didn't make it up but we made it famous
Then we spread it worldwide, go ahead and blame us
Growing up, gang culture taught us loyalty
And that everyone is equal, no royalty
So there's never been a king of the west coast
We got some OG's and we respect those
But anyone can get it if there's beef
And nobody's undefeated in the streets
I grew up on palm trees and gangsta rap
So pardon me, but I'm thankful for that
You know

[Interlude]
Yeah, and I want to take a minute to give a shout out to all the pioneers who started this shit. Rest in peace Mixmaster Spade, Toddy Tee, Greg Mack, K-Day, KMEL Too $hort, Freddie B, Rappin' Ron & Diddley Dog. The Luniz, Shock G, Saafir, Casual, Del, Hobo Junction, I know I'm missing a gang of people, Kid Frost, Lighter Shade of Brown, Psycho Realm. Everybody that's a part of this great culture. Freestyle Fellowship, Cypress Hill, B-Real, Tha Dogg Pound. Did I miss anybody? I probably missed a gang of niggas man. Rest in peace to Eazy-E, Eric Wright. We out. West side

When Eazy-E was playing on the radio
I knew exactly how my day would go
California sunshine coming in
Singing gangsta rap with all my friends
The origins of California hip hop
Where you can pop, lock, or you can get shot
Black, white, latin, asian, living in this melting pot
Throw up your W and it don't stopEmbed"

K-mel,When You Taught Me How to Dance,"4 ContributorsWhen You Taught Me How to Dance LyricsWhen you taught me how to dance

When you taught me how to dance
Years ago with misty eyes
Every step and silent glance
Every move a sweet surprise

Someone must have taught you well
To beguile and to entrance
For that night you cast your spell
And you taught me how to dance

Light reflections in a lake
I recall what went before
As I give, I'll learn to take
And to be alone no more

Other lights may light my way
I may even find romance

But I won't forget that night
When you taught me how to dance

Cold winds blow
But on those hills you'll find me
And I know
You'lre walking right behind me
You might also likeWhen you taught me how to dance
Years ago with misty eyes
Every step and silent glance
Every move a sweet surprise

Someone must have taught you well
O beguile and to entrance
For that night you cast your spell
And you taught me how to dance
And you taught me how to danceEmbed"
K-mel,Yellow Leaves,"2 ContributorsYellow Leaves LyricsYou surely are a truly gifted kid
But you're only good as
The last great thing you did
And where've you been since then
Did the schedule get you down
I hear you've got a new girlfriend
How's the wife taking it?

If it's uphill all the way
You should be used to it by now
You must know me, Father it's your son
And I know that you are proud
Of everything I've done
But it's the wonders I perform
Pulling rabbits out of hats
When sometimes I'd prefer
Simply to wear them

If it's uphill all the way
You should be used to it and say
My back is broad enough sir
To take the strain and it's

Hello mother, it's your son
And aren't you proud, of all I've done
But I'm turkey hungry, I'm chicken free
And I can't break dance on your knee
But it's ""stay right there son, baby do""
While I is itchin' for something new
So watch me Hawk eye, understand
The force of will, the sleight of hand
Movin' the river
I'm turkey hungry, I'm chicken free
And I can't break dance on your knee
Movin' the river
Bucket by spoon
And do you think that they'll like me
When they learn what I do
You might also likeMovin' the river
Money for jam
But it takes such an effort
To stay where I amEmbed"
K-mel,Your Longing Is Gone,"1 Contributor9/10 Freestyle LyricsA young ni**a back on the road
Just got a call from A1
And he say he up one
So my ni**a gone front me a load

I'm finna flip it, then count up my digits
Then give it right back to him, that be my bro
And this is not my first lap around the park
I do this sh*t so much, they think that I'm a pro

Keep that on the low dawg (low dawg)

As far as 12 know, I'm a rookie
Ain't no way in hell them ni**as finna book me
I don't know who got the plug on the cookie

Not finna get me on paper and dropping no names
What the f**k do I look like, Tekashi?
I got your baby mama at the crib and
She wax on and wax off like Mr. Miyagi

Tilly got black belts, like it's karate
I'm f**king a Spanish bi**h, calling me papi
Y'all ni**as wack, y'all raps is all copied
I promise to God, you ni**as will not stop me
You might also likeThis ain't overnight, swear I'm just trying to do it right
I'm a run up the stairs like I'm Rocky
Ain't no escalator, ain't no elevator
Ain't no way in hell the label finna drop me

Why you think I'm finna go independent?
I got the key to life, it's like my pendant
I got the prayer below, and the cuban above
Ain't no diamonds, but my shit be jiggin'

I swear to God, the only reason I live in Michigan
Is for these mother f**kin' children
Ain't even mine, I'm talking bout my niece and my nephews
But I'm finna grind so they get it

Sh*t could be easier if I up and move back to Arizona, or move back to Texas
But thank God for social media, that way all my people can see how I wreck sh*t

I got key to life, it's on my necklace
And I already told you about it
You keep on talking, I'm making one call to my ni**as
They finna come run for your wallet

I mean they kick in the door to your crib
They finna clean out everywhere you live
Give me the xbox, give me the television
Give me all of your clothes and your kicks
I'm finna sell it, no I'm finna keep it
No I'm finna sell it, sh*t is what it is
I got a couple of homies that need them some clothes
So my ni**as gone get them some 'fits

Aye to be real, I ain't hit a lick in a long time
I just had to say that sh*t for the one time
Have my ni**as air you out like the gun line
Brrrah Bah Bah! Like it's drumline

Nick Cannon with the stick ni**a
I'm a pull up on your bitch ni**a
I might whip through your hood
And pull up on your clique ni**a
Ask you ni**as what it is ni**a

(Hold on, bring it back)

Young ni**a straight out the Tone
Don't need no pens for my verses
You know how I'm working
I'm spitting this sh*t off the dome

I heard that these ni**as talking
Say they wanna off me, you pull up, believe that it's on
You know I'm a stoner, you ni**as still talking
I smoke you, don't care if it's blunt or the bong
My ni**a, I'm gone

Tilly, I'm not with the f**kery dawg
I pull up, you know I got metal on me
And it's shining, gutting you like cutlery dawg

I be the butler, you pull up on me, trying to serve me
You think you can f**k with me dawg??
You think you can f**k with me dawg?!
This ni**a got to be fooling

I use to carry the beam, now I call up my team
Cause a young ni**a steady be cooling

I'm on the couch with your bi**h, and my d**k on her lips
Man you know that lil shawty be drooling

I ain't even tripping, you know I like when it's sloppy
That show me, she know how to do it

Shawty say she gone top me at the top of the class
I guess she real good with medulla

She probably a tutor, how she on the books
Shawty say she gone suck me off my looks
Shawty say she gone f**k me off my looks
Shawty say I'm a vet, no I'm a rook

Watch how I dive in your guts, and I'm f**kin' you up
Now you standing naked while you cook
Knock at the door, bang it up, what the f**k
Oh it's 12, I go hide my shit off in the nooks

Man I mean the crannies
I had to hide all the xannys, the mary, the weed, and the coke
I got these bi**hes, talking that sh*t at the crib, and she know that finna come choke

Say that she trying to get smoked out
Say bitch you don't know what that smoke about
Bi**h you better pay up, if you ain't paying up
Then you better come on, put your throat out

Put your throat on the head girl
I'm a put you in the bed girl
Beat that pu**y 'til it's dead girl
Beat that pu**y in the red girl

I'm in the green
I be smoking, off the lean
I be willing with my team
I be living out my dream
Fu**ing bi**hes on the scene
Y'all already know what I mean

I be the coolest ni**a out of Texas
The mic, I be wrecking
The ankh on my necklace
Got cuban on top of it

Know I be killing sh*t like I be Popovich
Know I be pulling up when y'all be popping sh*t
Ni**as don't know how they watching sh*t
Y'all be looking like some mother f**kin opps and sh*t1Embed"
